Taming a Stray is a battle in "".
Entry.
"Meve's soldiers were seasoned warriors. They had served in many campaigns, fought on many fronts. Still, the Strays of Spalla caused them great unease. The brigands, howling like wild dogs, did not fight with ordinary sword nor spear, but with executioner's axes, boards with rusty nails, and instruments of torture - their faces concealed behind ghastly prison masks..."

Mykolas Climan was a Kovirian magnate from somewhere under the Koviri mountains.
Biography.
Once, during Midwinter, Mykolas posted a rich contract on a phoenix which had been "haunting" the surrounding mountains. Soon enough, great bounty hunters and swashbucklers descended on Kovir, names like Djenge Frett or the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who had until then fundamentally believed phoenixes don't exist.
The hidden truth, which Geralt discovered while on the creature's pursuit in mountains full of giants and trolls, was that Mykolas Climan posted the notice for a trivial reason; to present his wife with a dress adorned with the beast's feathers for Midinvaerne celebrations. As Geralt had sworn never to harm sentient creatures that were no threat to humans, he sided with the avian that had been brought down and a brief brawl took place between the hunters. Geralt managed to save the phoenix, the bird bowed its head in a gesture of gratitude and then flew off. Climan, desperate, gave his wife a note redeemable at any jeweler's shop in Lan Exeter, which contented her immensely.

In time, the Disgraced became known as near ideal mercenaries. Reasons were plenty: low cost, bearly ferociousness, no signs of fear or pain. They worked for many Continental armies. Nevertheless, after emerging alive from the battles – which they had been entering to seek death since the beginning – they often became frustrated and attacked regular soldiers. After stories of such incidents spread, only most desperate hired them.
In 1267, they sailed into swamps of Angren where they encountered Queen Meve of Lyria and Rivia.

"Rastburg Castle was of great strategic import. Whoever held it controlled the road between the Lyrian capital and Rivia as well as river transport on the Yavina.

History.
In 1267, he met Queen Meve at a crossroads northeast of Lord Clayton's residence. Reynard Odo quickly figured out who he truly was, due to the fact that the man he was pretending to be had just lost his father, and "Eldar" didn't know this.
The officer and his troops went to Rastburg Castle, asking for shelter there.
"If Meve investigated:" When Meve approached him, angry at him being a Nilfgaardian spy, a battle ensured, and the spy was killed.

Elsterberg

Elsterberg is a village in central Lyria.
History.
In 1267, Queen Meve travelled through this village and found rioting occurring. The villagers were angry as Nilfgaardian forces had just been through and pillaged their village. As a result, they took their anger out on an innocent elf, who lived in Elsterberg, dragging him to the centre of the village and threatening him, as they believed he was a Nilfgaardian spy. Meve had a choice to make, whether to let the humans attack him, or save the elf.
"If Meve saved the elf:" Meve demanded proof of the villagers, and seeing they had none, Meve allowed the elf to be free of all charges. Meve could then choose whether to let the elf join her ranks. If she didn't, the elf left the village.
"If Meve didn't interfere:" The humans killed the elf, believing he was of lesser blood and a spy to the Nilfgaardians, come to raze the village.

Walkthrough.
Travel to the village of Elsterberg, where you will come across a crowd harassing an elf, believing he is a Nilfgaardian spy. You can make the choice whether to help or not.
"If Meve helps the elf:" The elf is saved as the villagers have no proof of his alleged transgressions. He late asks to join Meve's ranks, as if he doesn't, after she leaves, he believes he will be killed by the villagers.
"If Meve enlists him:" The elf will join Meve's ranks, free of any danger from the villagers. Later the elf kills several of Meve's men in the Sabotage quest.
"If Meve helps him but leaves him at the village:" The elf leaves the village, as the villagers would have killed him if he stayed.
"If Meve doesn't interfere:" The villagers hang the elf, just after he curses Meve and all her company, so they leave the village and the quest ends.

"The hiss of bowstrings - then a moment later, Nilfgaardians fall to the dirt, cries catching in their throats. The Lyrians hollered in triumph. Alas, their celebration proved premature... The second salvo struck naught but pavise shields emblazoned with the Golden Sun. Meve rasped out a curse. Despite the advantage of surprise, it seemed victory would not come easy..."

Shupe was a rock troll who lived in Sloback Rut.
Biography.
During the Second Northern War, Shupe's residence was often travelled through by soldiers. One day in 1267, a group of Nilfgaardian soldiers set up tents outside his cave, much to his anger. The rock troll attacked the men, and Queen Meve, seeing her enemies fighting an innocent troll, helped him, by defeating the Nilfgaardians in battle.
After the battle, Meve and Reynard Odo spoke to the troll, who explained why he opposed the Nilfgaardians, and even offered human meat for them to eat. After the conversation, he gave Meve the Elf and Onion Soup gwent card.

Entry.
"The Nilfgaardian soldiers were well equipped. Each wore heavy black plate, a helm topped with black wings, and wielded a tall pavise shield emblazoned with the Golden Sun. The Lyrians, in their quilted jackets and light mail, appeared all the smaller and weaker by comparison... Yet they were to prove that the imposing Nilfgaardian armor was but a pretence of power."

Angren (province)

"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
Province of Angren is an administrative unit within the Nilfgaardian Empire. Named after the region Angren, it seemingly consists of southern Dol Angra lands and left-bank Riverdell – ironically lacking of the core areas of Angren itself, which was given to Temeria after the Peace of Cintra.
People of the region are skilled in wilderness survival.
Notes.
The existence of this area in the franchise is a result of mistakes made by creators of early world maps, including both Stanislav Komárek and CD PROJEKT RED. The first one was drawn before Andrzej Sapkowski provided the exact location of Angren in his "Baptism of Fire", while the latter probably didn't notice the mistake.
Nevertheless, the area was given a description in "The Witcher Role-Playing Game", making it a part of the official lore.

Sometimes even state officials or members of church inquisitorial offices hire such agencies in cases where discretion is needed.

Aurora Tasso was Queen Calanthe's agent and one of the most influential persons in the Cintran court prior to the Slaughter of Cintra.
Biography.
Dealing with Geralt.
In 1252, some time prior to the fateful birthday party of Crown Princess Pavetta, Aurora accompanied Calanthe and her court on the hunt. After Geralt of Rivia saved the royal ladies from a monster, she was the one who proposed he should stay until the wedding, seducingly promising she would accompany him.
In the night, Pavetta unconsciously caused hallucinations in her guards' minds – including Geralt's. Tasso, untouched by the princess' psionic abilities, noticed the witcher's state and tricked him to have sex with her, abusing the fact that he had visions of Yennefer. She then forced him to swear he would kill the Urcheon of Erlenwald.
During the birthday feast she demanded Geralt to fulfill his "oath", but he said that it was unwilling and only in a dream.
Personality.
Tasso was apparently lustful, but it wasn't certain whether was it her real trait or just pretended. She was manipulative, clever, resourceful – and committed to the goals of Cintra and Calanthe without demur.

Cridam is a village in eastern Lyria, located to the south of Dravograd.
History.
The village is famous for a mage named Cornelius the White who lived there. Following a conflict with town elders, he was forced to escape with haste. Before fleeing, however, he first hid his entire fortune in a nearby crevasse. Aware other residents would seek the treasure for themselves, he put a D'ao in place of a guard to protect it.
In 1267, Queen Meve visisted the village and found that the commander from the nearby garrison was there trying to gather men, as many had deserted the garrison. Meve had the choice whether to make a speech, press the townsmen into her army or raise the soldiers' salary.

Second Conjunction

The Second Conjunction of the Spheres was an event which occured at some time between 1270s and the late 15th century. Same as ages ago, multiple dimensions and timelines crossed each other bringing new beings and possibilities to the World.
The Exodus of the Elves.
It was during the Second Conjunction when the majority of Aen Seidhe left the Continent and the World permanently. Ard Gaeth opened on the Great Sea and the elves sailed to the portal in hope to find a better world. Not all of them managed however – many ships had sunk in the unimaginable storms or were destroyed by previously unknown kinds of monsters, while the others never had found the Gate and were forced to settle on the Western Continent instead.
Aftermath.
Even after the Conjunction ended, the region where the Gate had been opened remained dangerous and peculiar. Known as the Mad Sea, it is a quiet, misty part of the ocean. Travelers traversing its waters can sometimes see reflections of otherworldly islands, such as the Malus Island. Few dare to do so however because of the Verge, which is a fog-covered border dividing the Mad Sea from the rest of the Great Sea – the border populated by sea monsters of all kinds, where the Power still resonates in unpredictable ways.
The witchers emerged once again to protect the people from monstrosities. New schools have been founded, including the School of the Crane – and new codes of conduct have been created, such as the "Codex of the White-Haired" followed by witchers in Fabiolan countries.

The Order of Witchers was an attempt made by kings and affiliated mages in the 10th century to create an order of magic-using knights who would help Nordlings get rid of enemies they hadn't otherwise been able to subjugate, enclose in reservations, or exterminate – monsters.
The final outcome of the mutations disappointed most of the mages, who began to call the result "witchers", charlatans capable of nothing more than mere witchery. A few renegades however, including Alzur, secretly aided the monarchs interested in continuing the experiment, and the final set of Trials and Mutations was established.
The Order didn't last long however – its members had abandoned most of the original "knightly" values over time and soon split into a handful of witcher schools, aimed at taking a more professional approach to eradicating monsters.
History.
After the earliest attempts at creating witchers with adults proved unsatisfactory, it was decided that children would be used for future experiments. The mage Alzur traveled for weeks, collecting 38 children, before bringing them to Rissberg Castle.
At Rissberg, the children had to train day and night in order to prepare themselves for the coming experiments that the facility's mages had planned. This training included climbing cliffsides, running trap-laden obstacle courses, dodging swinging pendulums while blindfolded, and many other training methods. This training proved to be brutal as, before the mages could even begin their experiments, four of the children had already died. Among the remaining children was a Skelligan boy named Erland of Larvik and an Aedirnian girl named Jagoda.
As the time for the experiments grew close, the children had to start a regimen of bubbling mushroom stews and soapy alchemical teas. At first the children become faster and stronger, but as the experiments continued most girls grew ill, Jagoda among them. As the experiments officially began, the number of remaining children quickly dwindled. Jagoda died within the first week and it took nearly a month for the mages to successfully transform one of the boys before creating the first witcher. A week later, Erland was also successfully transformed. By the time all the children were put through the mutations only five boys remained.
However, the mages kept thoroughly inspecting and testing the surviving children before gathering professionals from all over, including hunters from Kaedwen, alchemists from Vicovaro, and swordsmen from every corner of the continent. These professionals trained the boys in their respective skills: the huntsmen taught them to track and hunt, the alchemists on how to brew potions and concoctions, and the swordsmen on how to fight. Despite all this the children proved unsatisfactory. The mutations had opened their bodies to the flow of power but they ended up with limited magical talent.
Leaving Rissberg.
Disappointed at this outcome, the witchers were banished from Rissberg but a few mages, such as Alzur, Cosimo Malaspina, and Idarran of Ulivo, decided to continue the experiment. This group ended up bringing the witchers to the abandoned Morgraig Castle in the Kestrel Mountains to continue their experiments and training.
Months before the first generation of witchers were to set out on The Path, their sword trainer was replaced by a knight errant some of the mages had met, Taliesin Bleddyn Yorath aep Lywelyn, but the witchers called him "Gryphon" after the black Gryphon on his shield. He not only taught them the southern sword styles but also spoke to them about their duty and that they were created for a reason. These words in particular resonated with Erland.
In the years that followed, as more witchers were created, they would set out on the path in the spring and take contracts across the continent. They would then return in the winter to the warm fires of Morgraig and spend time with their brothers in the castle, celebrating surviving another year on the path while mourning those who had died.
Fall of the Order.
Years later Alzur, Cosimo, and Idarran had left, leaving only a handful of mages to perform the mutations and leaving the order without a leader. While the witchers traveled all the known continent and there were more than enough settlements and contracts to cause no strife between them, they started to trick one another out of contracts and even threatening to kill each other if they didn't move on.
One incident proved to be the catalyst for the end of the Order. The witcher Arnaghad attacked another witcher named Rhys, nearly killing him. As Arnaghad returned to Morgraig he did so with a posse of his brothers. After a battle between the Order and the posse, the Order proved victorious despite many losses. Arnaghad and his posse left the Order and traveled to the Amell Mountains where he later founded the School of the Bear, and where years later a group of witchers would betray the School and nearly kill Arnaghad. This group would in turn leave and create the School of the Viper in the Tir Tochair Mountains. Before the establishment of the Viper School another group of witchers left to create the School of the Manticore, as they didn't agree with Ivar Evil-Eye and his ambitions.
After tales reached the Order of these new witcher schools, 20 younger witchers decided they would create their own school which would surpass the Order and get them the respect of the continent. As they left they took a great deal of mutagenic compounds and alchemical tools with them, in the hopes they'd use these to improve the alchemical formula that created witchers. They ended up traveling to Stygga Castle and took on the name School of the Cat and fashioned for themselves Cat-shaped medallions.
The remainders of the Order soldiered on for some time, but becoming more disillusioned with their purpose. Morgraig became more a sanctuary to hide then the warm home it had been. Eventually, Erland decided to leave the order with 13 of his best friends. Intent on not dealing another blow to the Order or causing a massacre, they wanted to cause as little bad blood as possible. As such, they announced that they would leave and explained why to the last remnant of the once proud Order. The group then traveled to Kaer Seren and created the School of the Griffin, having fashioned their school's name and ideas after their old sword trainer, Taliesin, otherwise known as Gryphon.
The last witchers that remained in the Order ended up leaving Morgraig and traveled east, eventually settling down in the Kaer Morhen valley. Here, they founded the School of the Wolf and created Wolf-shaped medallions for themselves, officially ending the original Order of Witchers. The time that came after would be remembered by witchers as the Golden Age while scholars would call it the Second Era of witchers.
Characteristics.
It is disputed what the witcher's code is as Geralt only uses it for his convenience and other witchers from different schools do not follow his code. However, it is agreed that one of the tenets of the order is to not kill fellow witchers. Unlike modern witchers, members of the order wore helmets and heavier sets of armor.

Daithi

The Daithi for Wood Elves and naiads or the Daisy for humans, is a river emptying into the Yarra.
Peaceful life of the naiads is often disturbed by nymph hunters from Irin. These humans sell the river nymphs to the city's bourgeoisie, who pay pretty well for "exotic pets" they can keep in their aquariums.

Naiad (Murky Waters lakeside)

This naiad which lived on the eastern shore of the Lakeside near Murky Waters was a loyal servant of the Lady of the Lake skilled in healing.
Biography.
In summer 1270, a host of drowners under the leadership of Zephyr, a particularly nasty drowned dead, began to harass her and even went so far as stealing a turquoise necklace which was gifted to her from the Lady.
"If Geralt kills Zephyr:" Eventually her woes were solved by witcher Geralt of Rivia who killed both Zephyr and his minions. For services rendered, the naiad offered him three possible rewards: an earth rune, a book about vodyanoy named "A Description of the Vodyanoi or the Fishpeople", or the status of her lifelong patient.

Irin

Irin is an wealthy human city on the Daisy river, connected by roads with Kreza to the south and Dyveken to the north.
The city was (in)famous for its "nymph hunters", a group of mercenaries enslaving naiads in the lower flow of the river, in order to sell them to the city's bourgeoisie – always eager to pay for "exotic pets" they could display in their aquariums. The hunters were not against enslaving other humans as well, as they did with Bovin Lagerfeld whom they intended to sell to one of the city's brothels.

Kreza

Kreza, or Breza, is a small town on the canals connecting the Yarra with the Vevera.
History.
The settlement arose around the sawmills complex built by merchant Terhoven, called "the king of the wood". His men used to drift the wood through the canals to the Vevera, from which they proceeded to the Sea of Gales and imperial shipyards in Dyveken on the Meskera's mouth.
The Vevera however turned dangerous route – if not the combats between its various barons and dukes, there was a constant danger of an elven rebellion or goblin raids. For this reason Terhoven funded a couple of expeditions to explore the other river allegedly leading to the Meskera, the Yarra. One of them eventually reached its destination and the new route was established.

The mud octopus is a creature evolved from the normal sea octopus. Regressing sea level made it to adapt into swamps and bogs of the Yarra, though at least one specimen lived in the caverns beneath the Temple of Yrrhedes in Red Horn Massif. Contrary to its marine ancestors, the mud octopus has only four prehensile tentacles, with the other four evolved for movement on solid surfaces.
In combat it can grab up to 4 opponents, but if it does so, it is then unable to protect itself from any attacks. If all of its four tentacles are cut of, it escapes, otherwise it fights to the death.

Orcs were a half-civilised race known for savagery – but also for respecting the code of honour and laws of war. They tended to organize in warbands, sometimes joining forces with trolls, ogres or goblins.
By the time of the Empire they were nearly extinct. Even the half-orcs tended to live at the margin of the society, as free trappers or thieves.
Some of the orcs worshipped Yrrhedes.

"[Translated from Elder Speech]"
"Elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings! The end of the old order is nigh. The oppressive regimes of the North, the plunderers of our lands, rapists of our folk, shall fall to the Nilfgaardian onslaught. And we can assist this downfall! We must assist it, each and every one of us! Those able to wield a weapon, join us in the woods, seek out a Scoia'tael commando."

There's No Place Like Home is a subquest of A Bitter Return in "".
Walkthrough.
After reaching the Lyria city outskirts and entering the city, this quest will start. Speak to Villem and then the two of you will go to the Council of Peers to discuss matters. Villem tells you he has made a alliance with Nilfgaard and Meve, by the order of Caldwell, is thrown into a cell.
Caldwell comes to visit you and reveals how he let the Strays of Spalla roam free, so when Meve was dealing with them, he could organize an overthrow. He tells of how she will be killed tomorrow, so Villem will never feel guilt and release her from prison. After a while Gascon Brossard comes and releases you from your cell. The two of you escape the prison and go free Reynard Odo from his cell and while leaving the city are attacked by Caldwell's men, starting the battle Hunting the Queen.

"Your Majesty,"
"Though we spoke to each other not long ago, I've no doubt you do not recall my name. I am the guard who stopped you as you fled Lyria - the guard who doubted you. "
"Your Highness, once more I apologise for my cowardice and thank you for giving me a chance to repair my error. I cannot save Lyria from the Nilfgaardian's talons - but I can write you about their secrets. I have won myself a post at the palace. I shall keep my ears open - and if I learn anything, I shall inform you at once."

Tobias

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Tobias was the guard captain of the Lyrian capital in 1267.
Biography.
Serving Queen Meve for several years, he betrayed her in 1267 during the Lyrian golpe, when Count Caldwell and the Nilfgaardian Empire took control of the country. After she escaped from the dungeons of the city, she came across Tobias guarding the city gate, and not recognising him, asked for him to prove his old loyalty by letting her and her remaining men pass, which, after hesitation, he did.
After Meve had fled the country and entered Aedirn, Tobias was assigned to the city's palace where he started to write letters to Meve, informing her of Nilfgaard's plans, as he wished to pay her back for his previous cowardice and betrayal.
Just before the war's end however, Tobias was discovered and beheaded by the Nilfgaardians, after several days of torture. His family (his wife and two children of 12 and 7 years of age), was captured and taken into custody, though their fate is unknown.

"A modest hamlet was located just to the north of Wayfarer's Beech. As Meve's army approached, it became clear - even from afar - that the village had not been spared the carnage of war. Its dwellings appeared smashed and burned, and a rancid, smoky stench lingered in the air. Yet what of the villagers' fate? Alas, they were strewn on the earth at the center of the settlement, their bodies mutilated by the gnashing maws of carrion-eaters... And the beasts had not strayed from their gory bounty."

Dagur Two Blades

"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
Dagur, called Dagur Two Blades for using two axes to fight, was a Skellige renegade and a member of the Disgraced led by Arnjolf the Patricide.
Biography.
At some point, Dagur committed an unknown crime which couldn't pass on Skellige. Banished from Spikeroog by Clan Brokvar's Council of Elders, he teamed up with other renegades under the helm of Arnjolf. They dubbed themselves Disgraced and became infamous through the Northern Kingdoms.
In 1267, Dagur sailed with Disgraced into swamps of Angren where they encountered Queen Meve of Lyria and Rivia.
Appearance and personality.
Just like the rest of Disgraced, Dagur's goal since being banished was to find an honorable death in battle, thus he rushed fearlessly at anyone without armor. He felt particular contempt for shields, considering them fit only for weaklings. His favorite food was lutefisk and he prayed mostly to Freya.

Knut the Callous

Knut the Callous, son of Oluf, was a jarl of one of Skelliger clans.
Biography.
A fearsome warrior, Knut became a Svalblod cultist at some point and, in fact, one of his strongest acolytes. He was said to often pick up and chuck his allied warriors at his enemies because he thought them weak. He even went as far as to denounce obedience to King of the Skellige Isles and claimed he would listen only to Svalblod and drown his opponents in blood.
His reign of terror and the deeds of other Svalblod followers then caused a short civil war which resulted in Skellige-wide forbiddance of the cult.

Casimir de Lauterpacht was the founder of Redanian Secret Service.
Biography.
Falka's Rebellion and Regency Council.
After King Vridank with his family were murdered by Falka, de Lauterpacht organized an underground conspiracy net. After Falka's troops were driven off the capital and the Regency Council took the power, it was Casimir who with his agents who prepared a coup d'état which gave the crown to the new King.
The Red Duke.
The Duke was rewarded by a title of the Crown Chancellor. His organization flourished, collecting secrets of the court, not hesitating to use knifes and poison. Lauterpacht quickly arose to position of the King's éminence grise. His net of spies and informants was rising quickly and covered the whole kingdom. Suddenly long-hidden Falka's atamans began being unhidden and publicly executed. The Chancellor's agents also handled the religious histery rising after the rebellion, secretly imprisoning the authority-opposing self-clamed prophets in Drakenborg granted to Lauterpacht by the King.
Aside Drakenborg and the "Red Duke" moniker, Casimir earned another thing – opposition from the nobility. During the First held by the King in 1187, "Forum Nobilium" charged the Chancellor with numerous allegations, including the high treason. After a quiet war between Casimir's and King's agents, the Red Duke was finally caught and ended up on a scaffold.

Vildkaarl

"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
Vildkaarls (meaning "wild men" in Skellige jargon) are a brotherhood of warriors in Ard Skellig highlands, independent of any clan. They eat what they hunt and live only to kill.
What's unknown to rest of the islanders is that they secretly worship the forbidden deity Svalblod and all the blood they spill is meant to be in sacrifice to him. The remaining priests of Svalblod submit vildkaarls to trials meant to ensure only the strongest individuals pass and then recreate them into werebears ("berserkers" on Skellige) via ancient ritual.
History.
In Skellige's formative years, when acolytes of Svalblod nearly drowned the Isles in blood, a short civil war erupted between the cultists and the rest. During it, berserkers committed mass murders and massacres until they were defeated. Worshipping Svalblod was then forbidden, his priests and followers bound on ships without sails and cast out to sea, henges brought down.
However, one small henge in Fornhala, the once-lively seat of Svalblod's cult full of ancient temples dedicated to him that had fallen into disrepair, survived. Fornhala's secret underground caves were where a few priests hid and began creating vildkaarls. Since then, warriors who have heard the "call of the bear" abandon their families and join the community.
They fought alongside regular Skelligers for decades and aside from building up a formidable myth-bordering reputation remained mysterious, revealing neither therianthropy nor cultism until 1272. After Konung Bran Tuirseach died, his wife Birna sought the vildkaarls out to recruit them for a coup which would turn Skellige into a hereditary monarchy with Svanrige Tuirseach as king. Their druid Artis was promised the position of advisor, hierophant title and lordship over Freyja's Temple with priestess expelled.

Erik Demartin was the head of the Redanian Secret Service after Casimir de Lauterpacht.
Biography.
Demartin used to serve as an agent under Chancellor Casimir. When his boss was charged with high treason, Erik sided with the king without hesitation – which resulted in his promotion to position of "The Undersecretary of Security" and giving him command over Drakenborg.
He restructured the Service thoroughly, aiding Redania during the Great Tariff War with Kovir and Poviss, which ultimately led to the Secession of Poviss and subsequent events in the north, allowing Radovid IV to annexate Yamurlak after Old Abrad's death.
He died in 1235 as the most well-informed man in the Northern Realms. His position was left vacant, and the superiority over the Service was held by the Secretary of the State Michael de Noailles.

Walkthrough.
Travel east from Brummfell until you come to a bridge guarded by Nilfgaardian forces. A cutscene will start, where it is explained that a Nilfgaardian caravan is going through the area with loot to be sent back south. You are presented with an option on whether to attack the caravan, but the quest will only continue if you choose to attack and the Imperial Transport battle will start.
After the battle is won, Meve will look through the wagons to find weary Aedirnian slaves, chained up, which she quickly frees, though they have no homes to go back to so they ask to join her army.
"Let the freed slaves join you:" The slaves join your army, grateful for a chance of survival, and Meve sees an elderly woman crying with relief, causing Meve to believe she made the right choice.
Later, the quartermaster in your army will discover they have stolen supplies during the night, and were planning to flee.
"Let the peasants stay:" Meve told the peasants they could stay, though if they were caught stealing again, would face capital punishment "(Decreases Morale)."
Later after passing Harmelen, one of the peasants thanked Meve and told her they were leaving to go live in the village, but gave her a gift for her actions "(+ Bone Talisman)."
"Force the peasants to go their own way:" Meve decided having the former slaves in her army was too large a hinderance and responsibility and choose to force them out "(Increases Morale)".
"Leave the freed slaves to their fate:" Seeing she had no supplies not the capability to look after so many weak bodies, Meve gave them three days worth of food, and with a unhappy mood, set off.

Red Horn is a mountain massif adjacent to the fertile valleys north of Vetteburg. It was infamous for the Yrrhedes cultists, who used to possess their main temple here. Able to sway humanoids and monsters to their cause by the power of Eye of Yrrhedes artifact, they presented a threat to the Empire until both the temple and the artefact were destroyed in two consecutive military and espionage operations.

Granted Power by him, they were able to convert several humanoids to follow their cause, including members of races such as orcs, kobolds, goblins and giants, as well as tame monsters such as basilisks and ghouls.
The threat was originally neutralized by a group of paladins and mages from Axen who razed the main temple to the ground. Twenty years later a group of mercenaries hired by Delibe priestesses infiltrated the undergrounds of the former temple and managed to destroy the Eye of Yrrhedes, an ancient artifact which was the source of power of Yrrhedes' worshippers.

"Good folk of Skellige, last week in the moors I found a man. Not moving a bit, so figured him for a stiff. Turned out he was breathing, but was so drunk he had booze instead of blood in his veins. I did not want him to freeze, for while it may be spring, the nights are still cold, so I took him to my house. The moment he sobered up a bit he drank my whole supply of mead, ploughed my wife and stole my brother's horse. I'm warning you, if you ever meet a drunkard called Odrin, best slay him on the spot and avenge me!"
"Our guards have captured a group of thieves. They would steal sheep to sell on other isles. The Council of Elders hereby orders their right hands hewn off and runes describing their lack of honor burnt onto their foreheads."
"The youngest daughter of Rudiger the Grey, Yrsa, has accepted the proposal of Lavar of Clan Brokvar. If ye wish them well, mention them with kindness in your prayers. If you wish them ill, may the sea swallow your bones."
"The folk of Ard Skellig know me to be a good fisherman. Man has yet to weave a net I cannot mend. So I'll mend yours, too, and for a small fee I'll throw in some bobs and a line guaranteed not to break, not even if a pregnant whale swallows it and dives. You can find me in my house after dusk, after I return from my day's fish. If you don't end up buying, we can still drink mead together."
"Sons and daughters of Clan an Craite! Every year the winters grow more severe. The snows melt later, the ice recedes later, crocuses grow later and ewes lamb later. So let this be a warning - start saving food early, dry it and smoke it, lest you not make it through the next frost."
"–Ermion"
"Hark! If you're sturdy and got a sharp axe, talk to Davur, son of Godmund. You will get good pay, food and lodging."
"Yamir the Old invites the warriors of clan an Craite to a farewell feast. He has lived a hundred years and feels death's approach. He will not wait for it to catch up. He will make a foray to the south alone, and he does not intend to come back. Before he departs, he wants to drink mead one last time with his friends and foes."
"Boatmaker Gotliv and his apprentices have launched the 'Hurtig', a longship built on jarl an Craite's order. Skellige has never seen a boat so fast and maneuverable. Clan an Craite warriors who wish to heft her oars should talk to Eydfinn One-Eye."
"Reinaldur of clan an Craite, son of Toki, wore a necklace made of a bear's teeth and claws, but it wasn't him who'd slain the beast. Thus the Council of Elders has decided that Reinaldur son of Toki will be deprived of his right to wear a sword and to swear oaths until he slays a bear armed only with a spear and a bronze dagger."
"Ingmar the Lighthouse Keeper did not return from the last raid. May he rest soundly in Nilfgaardian soil."
"Who among the warriors of clan an Craite is willing to keep watch at the lighthouse? Report to Kaer Trolde castle."

The elven ruins nestled in the forest add variety and are at once a subtle nod to the chapter's main location."

Candle lantern is a light source item in "", alternative to the torch and added with the "next-gen" Patch 4.0.
It can be found attached to the support beam frame at the entrance to the nekker monster den cave northwest of Hanged Man's Tree and southwest of the Border Post. The item appears in the "Weapons" inventory tab.
Prior to the next-gen patch, it was originally meant to be a quest item and while fully implemented into game, there was no way to get it without the use of console commands or mods.
Despite what the description says it doesn't really produce better light than a torch does and it only emits light in the front. However, it does appear to be brighter, but the range of view is pretty much the same. Like the torch it will also ignite flammable material such as swamp gas, if Geralt steps into it while holding it.

The tier of runestones, glyphs and diagrams for them offered will depend on the level that the runewright has upgraded his shop to. At the first, amateur level, only lesser upgrades will be offered, mid-tier ones are added at journeyman level, and then greater at master.
All upgrades except pyerog runestone and tvarog runestone are offered, with no level requirements, and unlike with any other merchant, they will always be offered and not chance-based. However, prices are generally higher than most - only diagrams are a tiny bit cheaper than in Novigrad, while runestones sell at the same price as Novigrad blacksmiths. Anything that can be bought in Velen will be cheapest there.

The Price of Peace is a story quest in "". It starts when you reach the gates of Gatberg.
Walkthrough.
After entering Aedirn and passing over the bridge to Gatberg, approach the city gate and this quest will begin. After discussing the city, seeing it very thinly defended and its gates opened, you can choose to attack the city. To continue the quest, you have to attack the city.
After you make your decision, your troops will attack the city and The Battle of Gatberg will begin. After the battle ends, the mayor of the city will come to talk to you, telling you that if Meve takes the gold from the stores in the city, her troops will leave with no protection towards the city, as no soldiers would remain as guards, and if the Nilfgaardians returned, they wouldn't have the gold to bribe them to spare the citizens. So the mayor asked Meve to leave the gold behind. Rayla recommends to Meve to take the gold, as she considers the mayor a coward and believes he wants to fund the Nilfgaardian Army.
"Take the gold:" Meve told the mayor the gold was needed for her small army, which the man disheartenedly agreed to.
"Leave the gold in Gatberg:" Meve decided that the city of Gatberg needed a line of defence, the bribe of the gold. She asked the mayor that if Nilfgaard was losing the war, that the men of the city would take up arms and fight for the cause, which the mayor agrees to.

Entry.
"The queen had feared her soldiers would not court death for the sake of an Aedirnian city. After all, why risk one's neck for a neighbour's home when you have yet to reclaim your own? Nonetheless, Meve's infantry fought ferociously, never breaking. In the face of Nilfgaard's onslaught, the trifling differences among Lyrians, Temerians, and Kaedwenis no longer mattered. Ultimately, they were people of the North - and they must answer each other's call."

Among the Ashes (quest)

Among the Ashes is a story quest in "".
Walkthrough.
Once you arrive at the city of Rosberg in Aedirn, this quest will start, with Rayla expressing her anger at the Nilfgaardians taking the city. Nilfgaardian scouts see Meve, so The Battle of Rosberg starts.
After the battle ends Meve will start to leave the city, though first she meets Xavier Lemmens, who she saves from the fire. He explains why the city fell, blaming it on Scoia'tael and then asks to join Meve's company, which she excepts. So then Meve and the rest of her army continue on to Aldersberg, to find King Demavend III.
Entry.
"Sadly, it was Rayla who met with surprise. A hundred-yard gap gaped in the "unbreachable" walls of Rosberg. The fortress itself was aflame, spewing black smoke into the sky."
"I don't... how?! It can't be!"
"There was no time to consider her question, for Nilfgaardian scouts had spotted Meve's company. The queen knew battle was inevitable, so she gave the signal to form a defensive line, then drew her blade."

Thus the Lyrians were not fighting for honor nor spoils, but for survival..."

Kerack Dynasty

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
The Kerack Dynasty was a family reigning in the Kingdom of Kerack.
History.
The dynasty was founded by an individual named Osmyk at the beginning of the 13th century. He was a trader and a pirate of unknown nationality who chose the city of Kerack as his base of operations. After finishing off the competition and monopolising the region's cabotage, he crowned himself as the first king of Kerack.
Osmyk was followed by Belohun, the only one of Osmyk's five sons who did not renounced the crown. Following his father's steps, he ruled for over 20 years, profiting from the maritime trade and piracy. He died just in time of his fifth marriage, secretly assassinated in result of a conspiracy between his eldest son Viraxas, his might-have-been wife Ildiko Breckl and mages of Rissberg and the Chapter.
In return for obtaining the throne, Viraxas had to pay off his debts for the Chapter. Apart from raising taxes, he apparently expanded his realm eastwards, thus coming into the conflict with dryads of Brokilon. His hatred towards the eerie wives grew so high, so he attempted to plan a "blitzkrieg" at the dryad forest some time before the Northern Wars. In order to do so, he plotted with Ervyll and Order of the White Rose and tried to convince Foltest and Jurkast to his plans. These plans were never fulfilled as he was murdered by "princess" Frisanna, daughter of Jurkast and his dryad lover. After Viraxas' death, the crown was passed to his son Tarrand.
By the time "Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi" was written, the dynasty was long extinct and their lands were stripped between Verden and Cidaris. It is believed that the downfall might have roots in the Catriona plague, reportedly brought here by a plague maiden.

Eatewedd

Eatewedd, later known as Feainne, was a dryad of Brokilon who engaged in a romantic relationship with Prince Jurkast of Maribor. She was described as a beautiful woman with sharp, regular facial features, dark complexion and long red hair.
Biography.
Eatewedd.
Less than twenty years before Northern War I, Eatewedd bore her first daughter, Daermelionors. Few months later, she was chosen by Eithné to participate in a ritual: two dryads were to sleep with two human noblemen in order to give birth to two girls chosen by Destiny to "save Brokilon and die". At the appointed night, she slept with Prince Jurkast of Maribor.
Next morning, however, enamoured Jurkast managed to seduce Eatewedd and persuaded her to go with him to his palace. While wonderful at the beginning, their love did not lasted long. About five years after birth of Minneluned, their daughter, Eatewedd convinced the castle's falconer to escort her to her motherland, where she and Minneluned drank the Water of Brokilon. After their memory was cleansed, they assumed new names: the mother became known as Feainne and the daughter as Woédgláeddyv.
Feainne.
Once upon a time during Feainne's service as the forest's sentinel in the swampy area near the border with Maribor 13 years later, she and two other dryads followed Jurkast's emissaries, though unnoticed by the humans. After the emissaries were attacked by a vypper, the sentinels intervened and shot the monster. Humans recognized Eatewedd in their savior but she did not remember that name even though it rang some bells.
She escorted them to Duén Canell where Eithné, after long negotiations, agreed to send Minneluned back to Maribor. At the forest's border, while she was goodbyeing her daughter, she heard a swishing sound.
"If the emissaries (players) intervened:" the bolt did not reach its destination. After long fight, the assassin was defeated but died before he could be questioned. On his jacket there was a symbol of an unknown organization.
"If the emissaries (players) failed to intervene:" Feainne died, covering her daughter. After long fight between the emmisaries and the assassin, the latter was defeated but died before he could be questioned. On his jacket there was a symbol of an unknown organization.

This book should've been available and very common as random loot, as well as sold by the books merchant in Hierarch Square.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;The Syndicate was an underground alliance of shady figures such as gang bosses and church officials, united in pursuit of the coin. Originally active in Novigrad, it later spread to other regions of the Northern Realms.
History.
Origins.
Before the Syndicate was formed around late 1267 or early 1268, Novigrad's underworld was best described as a chaotic battleground between various gangs, agents of foreign intelligences, dwarven banksters, law enforcers and religious militias. Such a chaos used to cause problems for the commercial centre of the North and posed a potential danger of being abused by the Nilfgaardian Empire, whose army was supposed to inevitably attack again.
Being aware of the current situation's drawbacks, Count Sigismund Dijkstra from Redanian Secret Service (under the alias of Sigi Reuven) initiated the birth of the Syndicate at meetings with the city's hierarch, Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart, and leaders of the four most influential Novigradian gangs: Carlo Varese, Cyprian Wiley, Francis Bedlam, and Gudrun Bjornsdottir. Although the meetings were originally spent mostly on disputing the spheres of influence within the city, the final agreement was eventually reached.
First years and the Big Four.
Dijkstra/Reuven returned to Novigrad at some point between 1268 and 1272 from his exile, and finished the Syndicate's Code of Conduct. The organization was joined by two large traders in the fisstech market: Azar Javed, the leader of the Salamandra, and Jacques de Aldersberg, Grandmaster of the Order of the Flaming Rose (which in itself was another organization that Dijkstra had helped to create). The Salamandra and the Order seeked to seize control over Vizima, the capital city of Temeria, with aims to rule the kingdom alongside Adda the White. These plans were ultimately spoiled by the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who killed both Azar and Jacques in 1270.
The relationship between gangs in the formative years of the Syndicate was apparently fluid, as by 1272 the Tidecloaks no longer controlled the city's port. The four most influential leaders, known as the Big Four, plotted against each other and against the hierarch, disagreeing at topics such as the situation of the sorceresses or the exact areas of the city to control. After Cyprian "Whoreson Junior" Wiley accepted Radovid V's money and attempted at assassinating the other three members of the Big Four, his gang was nearly obliterated by Carlo's Crownsplitters and he found himself betrayed by Radovid who gave the information on his hiding to Geralt.
"If Geralt kills Whoreson Junior:" Whoreson Junior was killed by the witcher. Taking advantage of the situation, doppler Dudu took his appearance and identity, revealed to his remaining men that he finally converted to the Eternal Fire, sold all his illegal enterprises and acted as a respectable businessman.
"If Geralt spares Whoreson Junior:" Due to the details concerning his treason having been leaked, Junior lost all of his power and was forced to live in poverty on the streets.
Structure and activities.
The primary purpose Syndicate was created for was mutual aid and profit for its members – or, to be more specific, the most high-ranked ones. Only the organization's founders and a couple of trusted people was even aware of its exact nature. Most of the other knew only of the Syndicate's secret currency and the code of conduct, and the more specific questions were often left unanswered by the leaders.
The Syndicate's Coin is a special currency that bounds the organization together. Made of gold, it depicts a symbol of arms in a praying or swearing gesture surrounded by the text: "SYNDICATE UNBREAKABLE VOW". It is used for any tasks or trade, but exchanging it as payment seals an inviolable pact – a failure in comforting it leads to hunting down the ones who have broken it and forcing them to pay a far greater price, and not even the leaders can protect anyone from these dire consequences.
"Some fight for honor, others for empire. Some fight for king, others for freedom. The members of the Syndicate fight for but one purpose – wealth. If you've the means to afford their services, they will perform whatever deed you require... No matter how heinous. In the criminal underworld, it is through crime you build your reputation and fill your purse. While the city's economy thrives on the Novigradian Crown, its underbelly revolves around coin of a different sort. When exchanged as payment, an inviolable pact has been sealed. And those foolish enough to break it shall be hunted down and forced to pay a far greater price."
"Scroll 1: Ah, Novigrad! Thirty-thousand inhabitants, eight banks, four water mills... And five exceptionally dangerous gangs."
"Scroll 2: Every Novigradian knows the names of the underworld's most powerful leaders: Cleaver, the King of Beggars, Gudrun Bjornsdottir, Whoreson Junior, and Sigi Reuven."
"Scroll 3: They differ from each other in almost every regard – age, race, gender, demeanor. Yet, they all possess one trait that ties them together, a common denominator... Their love for coin."
"Scroll 4: For a purse brimming with gold, they are prepared to do whatever necessary – betray, destroy, slaughter. And they will do so with a smile upon their lips."
"Chest 1: Not only is Novigrad the Continent's most vital port city, but it also serves as the seat of the Church of the Eternal Fire. It is here the cult's hierarch presides, it is here the Sacred Flame burns... It is here mages, herbalists, alchemists, and non-humans are burned alive en masse atop pyres."
"Chest 2: Novigrad remains a free city, yes, but for how much longer? Redanians and Nilfgaardians alike gaze upon the wealthy port city with hungry eyes. Both attempt to curry favor and influence amongst city leaders, clergymen, and the dregs of the underworld. Yet, to earn their loyalty, a handsome sum must be paid..."
"Chest 3: Folk from the world over flock to Novigrad with dreams of great riches, fame, and a taste of true luxury and power. For a fortunate few, their dreams indeed become a reality... For all else, what awaits them is a life of begging for coppers, praying to the gods for just one more pouchful of fisstech."

Gudrun Bjornsdottir

"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
Gudrun Bjornsdottir was the leader of the Tidecloaks and one of the founders of the Syndicate, a major criminal organization influential in Novigrad since 1267.
Gudrun is a Syndicate leader introduced in the Novigrad expansion.
"Scroll 1: Gudrun had once been a terror of the Great Sea. At the mere sight of her dreaded longship, the Flyndr, merchant vessels would hoist their white flags of surrender without a moment's delay."
"Scroll 2: That is, until the day the cutthroat Skelliger decided to offload her bounty in Novigrad... Then resolved to settle there forever."
"Scroll 3: For you see, the Free City of Novigrad is laden with great riches. Why prowl the vast seas in search of unknown treasures when much more had been so conveniently concentrated already in one place?"
"Scroll 4: The Flyndr remains to this day moored in Novigrad's port, its deck floating scarcely above the waves. Has it fallen into disrepair or taken on water, you ask? No, no... The truth is simply that precious metals in immense quantities can prove rather heavy."
"Chest 1: The pirates under Gudrun's command learned quickly that the hooks they'd long used for boarding ships would perform equally well on the multistory buildings of Novigrad. Nowadays, whenever prudent Novigradians hear something clank and scrape across their roofs, they quickly gather their most valuable possessions and hurry to lock themselves in the cellar."
"Chest 2: On the Skellige Isles, women and men stand on equal footing. Both learn the arts of war and seafaring. Despite this widespread knowledge of Skellige's customs, many mainland folk give a snort and a wink at the sight of Skellige's warrior women, thinking their weapons serve merely as decorative trinkets. Gudrun has always relished opportunities to personally educate folk on the consequences of their ignorance."

Woédgláeddyv

Woédgláeddyv (born as Minneluned, later renamed Frisanna) was a daughter of dryad Eatewedd and human prince Jurkast of Maribor.
Biography.
Early life and Brokilon.
She was born in city of Maribor as an illegitimate daughter to the ruling prince. Her name, "Minneluned" meant "a daughter of love" in dryad dialect. Similar to her mother like a doppelganger, she had her father's eyes.
When Minneluned was about five years old, her mother decided to take her back to Brokilon, their motherland, because of Jurkast's growing frigidness towards his informal family.
In Brokilon, Minneluned drank Water of Brokilon and obtained new name: "Woédgláeddyv", meaning "Sword of the Forest".
Return to Maribor.
When Woédgláeddyv was about 18, Prince Jurkast's emissaries arrived to Brokilon to negotiate her return to Maribor. Queen Eithné initially opposed the idea, claiming that the girl's destiny is to "defend Brokilon and die". Only after several concessions made by the Mariborians the Queen agreed. She presented the emissaries a final test: they can take the girl if they are able to recognize her from her identical half-sister. Despite the odds the humans succeeded and Eithné was shocked. She ordered Woédgláeddyv to go with humans and ignored the girl's cries.
In Maribor castle's chambers, Triss Merigold put the girl asleep and performed a ritual to restore her memory and convince her that she was named Frisanna – same as the deceased princess who was supposed to marry Redanian prince Fulko to ensure lasting peace between Redania and Temeria. While the ritual seemingly succeeded, its subject was constantly repeating "I am not Frisanna… I am not Minneluned… I am Woédgláeddyv, the Sword of Brokilon".
"Frisanna" spent next three weeks on tedious education in fields of etiquette, savoir-vivre, reading and writing in Common, dancing, embroidery and dozens of other such important skills that a princess preparing for seven years to marry a prince should obviously possess. In order to avoid the gossips, the princess was isolated in the castle's tower and was attended only by teachers, maid Agnes, lady-in-waiting madame de Corpido, and the guards – who happened to be the same group who served as emissaries in Brokilon, as Jurkast wanted to limit both the number of witnesses and the cash spent on salaries. Frisanna-Woédgláeddyv attempted at befriending the guards, but distanced herself after learning how had Jurkast dumped her mother.
The day "Frisanna" learned the details about her parents' relationship, she faced an assassination attempt targeted at her. The assassin, Carlos, was impersonating her new dance teacher, Terprise of Bremervoord. After disposing of the assassin and interrogating his henchman, Mark, the guards discovered a plot against the duchy – members of the so-called War Party intended to kill Jurkast's daughter in order to prevent the peace from lasting and continue wars against Redania for Temeria's greater glory.
Over the few next days, while the Duke's mercenaries continued their investigations concerning the Party and vice-Chancellor Des Letameris, Woédgláeddyv began a preparations to escape Maribor. As by doing so she would break Queen Eithné's direct orders, she decided to go to Dol Blathanna and Blue Mountains instead, through the secret passes in Angren. Not accustomed to horses, she inadvertently exhausted her mount to death. After long chase, which included misleading the pursuers into a kikimore's nest, she did surrender. Back in Maribor, the princess' mind was tethered by Triss so that she could not attempt at another escape. After the War Party was destroyed or at least decimated, the princess was safe to be sent to her bridegroom in Tretogor.
Road to Redania.
Frisanna left Maribor in a golden carriage, accompanied by the Duke's guards, 30 Temerian knights, landsknechte, archers and and 30 Redanian knights led by Count Lanval. While leaving, the group witnessed the mysterious death of Des Letameris.
"Optional adventure:" In a rocky ravine along the road, the carriage was suddenly snathed by a white dragon: the sight very unusual in this region. Dozens of knights immediately vowed to kill the monster and save the beast, while Count Lanval asked Duke's men about the princess' virginity – reportedly a matter of life and death when it comes to dealing with dragons and maidens. The dragon was found by one of the search parties in a valley, surrounded by the dragon hunting dwarves and mage Hidlobard. Tired by the combat, the dragon telepathically asked the newcomers to help him in exchange for the carriage.
"If the search party (players) kill the dragon:" After a long search, the group eventually found the dragon's nest in a cold cave, along with its treasury and the carriage with Frisanna. Stunned by Merigold's spell, the princess awoke just before her survivors arrived.
"If the search party (players) kill the dragon hunters or convince them to leave:" The grateful beast introduced himself as Germinus and led them to his nest, a cold cave filled with treasures. Stunned by Merigold's spell, the princess awoke just before they arrived.
"If they try to steal a part of treasure, or if the dwarves are alive and accompany them:" a network of spells protecting the treasury activated, infuriating Germinus. The party had to face the dragon's wrath or do their best to calm him.
"If Hidlobard is alive:" he contacted the party telephatically and helped them to defeat the dragon.
"If they behave:" the dragon offered his help with modifying the spell tethering Frisanna's mind, so that she was able to think in more sober way.
Some time later, the group reached Vizima where Princess Frisanna was to meet her royal uncle King Foltest. While she was waiting with her guards and Count Lanval before the throne room of the castle, she accidentaly overheard the King's discussion with Viraxas' emissaries. After a heated debate, Foltest agreed to Kerack's terms: after Frisanna's planned marriage Temeria would not prevent the planned "blitzkrieg" on the dryads' ancient queendom. The dryad princess was furious inside but did not reveal her consciousness.

Blood-covered letter is a book in "".
This letter is found on a corpse at Calveit Watchtower, inside the main tower. However, it can be difficult to obtain as it can only be retrieved before the abandoned site there is cleared of ghouls, which constantly keep Geralt in combat mode, which prevents looting. As soon as the last ghoul is killed, the area is liberated and cleared of any corpses, including the one with the letter on it.
"Dearest Sweetiekins,"
"It's horrible, what you wrote me. How are you and a few others supposed to hold off an enraged mob? They should either send more men or let you retreat. Tell that to those brilliant generals of yours! High time someone talked some sense into them. You might only be a Corporal Treasurer, but if you lay it all out to them calmly, I'm sure they'll listen to reason."
"Be careful out there, sweetie. Always wear a helmet to battle and put on those thick socks I sent when you go to bed. From what I've heard, it's always cold and rainy in the North, so remember to look after your health!"
"-Your Dweffren"
"P.S. Darling, do you think you'll win the war by Midinváerne? My mum wants to come visit."

Morrigan, called also Lady of the Ravens and known in Elder Speech as "Mori Rígain", is a Nordling goddess of elven origin. She is considered a patron of magic, war and phantoms.
History.
Since ancient times the intersection below the Holy Sycamore of the Gwyd Mountain had been considered as a seat of unnatural power, thought by Aen Seidhe elves to be an incarnation of "Mori Rígain". When Nordlings reached the area, they adapted elven beliefs and built a castle on the mountain around the sacred tree. Apart from the castle's rulers it became a seat of priestesses of Morrigan and the centre of her cult. Many religious writings were produced here and the sanctuary became a destination of pilgrimages.
The situation changed around the late 1250s, when Countess Ailen of Gwydberg banished the last of priestesses, Vela, because the latter accused Ailen's husband Constans of raping her. Unconsciously, Vela cursed the castle and the Sycamore heard her plead. In a disastrous storm the fortress was severely damaged and ravens started to attack the inhabitants forcing them to flee. The sole residents of the former sanctuary became were priestess Vela and cursed Ailen's daughter, Iola of Gwydberg.
Gwydberg remained a ruin until early 1270s when it was reached by two expeditions, one led by Kala of Gwydberg, Queen Cirilla's vassal, and another by merchant Bruno Messmer. Members of the latter discovered that the Sycamore was in fact a prison of an otherwordly entity trapped here millennia ago.
Cult.
Not much is known about the elven practices devoted to the deity. When Nordlings adapted Morrigan to their pantheon, they built her a chapel on the Gwyd Mountain. At least one virgin priestess always lived in the castle, where she was taking care of the sacred tree, performed rituals for the goddess and tutored novices as well as the count's children. The cult spread to different regions but Gwydberg remained its very core.

The dynasty was also connected with such noble lines as the House of Raven and the Delens from Temeria.

Julia Kenyon's diary is a quest item and document in "".
It can be found inside one of the houses west of Portside Gate in Farcorners. Reading it can start the quest and will provide directions to the passages underneath Temple Isle.
 "We sold the artifacts we acquired during our last expedition at the Hraki Bazaar in Cidaris. Made only a modest profit, but a profit all the same."
 "Dicker has came across information about a purported elven treasure hoard said to be hidden in the sewers beneath Temple Isle. To my thinking these rumors might very well be true. After all human cities, Novigrad included, were built on elven foundations. So why should we not search for elven treasure beneath its streets? If but a tenth of what the tales say is true, this hoard contains enough riches to last us to the end of our days."
 "Today is the first of Feainn. We are setting out. Our party consists of Rian, Dicker, Maxi, Miko and me."
 "The entrance to the underground passages was protected by an illusion. Luckily Miko was able to dispel it. There truly must be something of value down here. We shall descend deeper."
 "This does not look like a treasury. It is rather some sort of hospital. Or a laboratory."
 "[after this point the entries are chaotic, with many blots and incomplete words] A massacre, I... Only I... Could do nothing - the others... Dead, all! The elves, that was their laboratory, and... What we saw... It... He..."
 "I cannot sleep for the umpteenth night in a row. I see them all whenever I close my eyes - Rian, Dicker, Maxi, Miko... This insomnia is killing me. And that symbol... That cat... It stares at me..."
 "Here kitty kitty kitty!"
 " Meow."

The Chevron Knight was a young Rivian nobleman who guarded the capital city's gate.
Biography.
Early June 1268, the knight stationed in his tent outside the walls, near the toll house. He was studying the incomers with a sharp and offensive gaze, in hopes of noticing a warrior worthy of dueling. On the 6th of June, he met came across Geralt of Rivia, but the famed witcher dashed the knight's hopes, claiming that whoever his dame of heart was, she was the most beautiful and virtuous virgin between the Yaruga and the Buina. The knight, though disappointed, had no choice but to agree.
Later that day, the Chevron Knight charged to help nonhumans facing a pogrom. Mounted and in full armour, he whipped the bloodthirsty commoners with his quirt until they managed to throw him off the horse and swarmed on him trying to find weak spots in his armor. His final fate is unknown, but there is a possibility he was saved by the hailstorm conjured by Triss Merigold and Yennefer just a moment later.

Remarks Concerning the Death of Auberon is a document in "", written by Avallac'h.
It can be found under the family tree inside Avallac'h's secret residence at the Pali Gap Coast cave, during the quest Child of the Elder Blood.
"When Auberon Muircetach died, we lost not only our finest sage and leader, but also our best chance to renew the gene of the Elder Blood. Prior to his, success seemed possible, even imminent. I had interpreted Cirilla's willingness to attempt to beget his child - despite her earlier resistance - as a personal triumph and a sign there was more of Lara in her than I had ever imagined possible.Now, with all my designs shattered and the benefit of hindsight, I have concluded that putting pressure on her then in Tir ná Lia had a very negative effect on our relationship. Yet I could not have predicted that Muircetach had so little time remaining, and would squander it so foolishly, even though Cirilla was his for the taking.Now my only hope lies in trying to regain her confidence and trust at any cost."

Immunity Revoked

Immunity Revoked is an optional battle which may happen during the subquest I, Ardal aep Dahy in "".
"Nilfgaardian heavy infantry and cavalry have a dark reputation in the North. The very sight of their black armor and the sound of the wings atop their helms instill a sense of dread. Imperial emissaries, dressed in silks and decorative fringe, may appear less menacing, yet pose no less a threat. Their watchful eyes and venomous words have contributed to the collapse of many a realm..."
"The envoy's escort crumbled beneath the onslaught of Meve's Lyrians, who grabbed the emissary and brought him before their queen. Robes torn and head bloodied, he no longer exuded imperial pride."
"Your Grace, what would you have us do with this pompous arse?"
"Command your men to clap the envoy in irons.:"
"I want him shackled in iron collar and manacles. To the capital we shall take him, and in the castle dungeon he shall taste of Northern hospitality!"
"The envoy's jaw opened, but no sound, no protest came forth. The queen's irate stare drilling into him, he simply swallowed audibly. Traheaern var Vdyffir, usually silver-tongued, remained utterly silent the rest of the way to the capital."
"Order Reynard to kill the envoy.:" 
"Kill him. Then take his head, drop it in a jug of honey and deliver it to General aep Dahy with my compliments."
"The envoy objected, protested, pleaded, cited pacts and conventions, evem went so far as to call on common human decency. Meve was deaf to all."

"-Eldain"
"From: Colonel Fferys Liogwr"
"To: Corporal Dwyllyn Ffionr"
"Queen Meve has wormed her way through the trap and is now hewded for Red Lobinden. You must cut off her escape route at all costs. Should you fail, every third soldier in your unit shall be lashed and sentenced to a month of solitary confinement."
"From: Count Caldwell"
"To: Corporal Cffyfri Vffelegh"
"We still lack enough loggers to meet the expectations of our most gracious emperor, Emhyr var Emreis, the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Foes - may the Great Sun shine upon him. If they'll not be tempted by coin, a whip will suffice. The boors are squatting like beasts in the woods, but I've no doubt you'll find them, I expect to have two dozen new laborers before the month's end."
"From: Ragbard, Lord of Temeria, Mahakam and the Pontar"
"To: Drogovit, Grand Royal Huntsman"
"I read your letter with keen interest. Ysgith indeed sounds like a horrid place. It comes as no wonder the elves surrendered it without a fight. In any case, the felling must continue. Construction of Tuzla Castle has proven difficult due to a scarcity of strong, stable, building materials. We require two dozen oaks, aged one hundred years or more, at absolute minimum. I'm relying on you, Drogovit. Do not disappoint me. You shall see the full extent of my generosity."

He must soon be removed, but in such a way as to avoid causing fear among our other allies in the North. Given the count's well-known passion for wine and spirits, poison should prove most effective. We shall put the plan into action once Queen Meve is no longer an issue. It shouldn't be long now. Await my signal."
"From: Foltest, King of Temeria, Pontar, Mahakam, Sodden and Angren"
"To: Angrenian Foreign Defense Corp"
"The Nilfgaardians have breached our defenses, I am ordering a complet retreat to Temeria and Brugge via the shortest routes. Do no confront Nilfgaardian forces, except in cases of direct attack or attempts at disarmament. All should negotiate the withdraw of garrisons for each town they reach."
"From: Duke Ardal aep Dahy, Grand Chancellor, Commander of Army Group "East" "
"To: Sergeant Yion Ffran"
"Sergeant, Queen Meve approaches Rivia. Though her ultimate failure is assured, we cannot rule out the possibility thatbshe will breach the cordon at the border. Thus, I reccomand all outpost commanders to conceal division treasuries. In the unlikely event of failure at the border, our resources shall nevertheless not fall into enemy hands.

It can be looted from the fishing hut at the abandoned site west of Hangman's Alley in Velen.

Before long, new recruits began to appear in the imperial army's ranks: over a dozen feet tall, unwaveringly obedient, and made of solid rock. "

Sophia of Denesle

Sophia of Denesle was the wife of Sir Eyck of Denesle and mother of Siegfried.
Biography.
Sophia and Eyck married at some point during or prior to the 1250s. She bore him a son, Siegfried, though according to rumors circulating in Vizima two decades later his true biological father was said to be Jacques de Aldersberg.
Roughly between the 1250s and 1260s, Sophia fell seriously ill and became pinned to her bed for long time. Fearing for his mother's life, Siegfried begged his father to demand payment for at least a few of the next beasts he would slay. Eyck, however, refused so as to not stain his reputation of a voluntary paladine.

Syanna's Gang

"That white-haired bloke... Gerard? Gerwant?" — The actual name of this subject is conjectural or unknown.
"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Syanna's Gang was a gang based out of Nazair that had formed sometime prior to 1275.
History.
When Syanna was still a teenager, she was cast out of her homeland of Toussaint and left for dead on the edges of Caed Dhu. As luck would have it though, some of the gang was camping in the area and when the former princess found them, instead of hurting her, they took her and took her back to their home in Nazair, where Syanna joined their gang and quickly rose through the ranks before eventually leading them herself.
Like a typical gang, they took part in the usual criminal activity like stealing, fencing, and killing, but with her thoughts still on Toussaint, Syanna eventually decided it was time to return around 1275 and make those who hurt her all those years ago pay for their misdeeds.
Syanna used the group to do her bidding and blackmailed her former lover, Dettlaff, into killing the four knights that had escorted her out of the duchy as a teenager. She also used some of the men to barter for Sangreal wine and to try and steal back the Heart of Toussaint, both of which she believed to be her birthright. However, the latter item turned out to be the group's undoing as it pinpointed her as the mastermind behind all the killings. The group was eventually massacred during a combined attack by Geralt, the Toussaint Ducal Guard, Regis, and Dettlaff on Dun Tynne Castle.

Ekhart Henessy was the ensign and color bearer of the Kaedweni Dun Banner division. He was a veteran of the Battle of Brenna and of the Battle of Vergen during the Lormark War, where he perished. He was later buried in the dwarven catacombs beneath the city.
Geralt of Rivia met Ekhart Henessy in his wraith form after his death, when he accepted to lift Sabrina Glevissig's curse on the battlefield near Vergen; to do so, he needed however the Standard of the Dun Banner division, which was being guarded by Ekhart's ghost in the catacombs.

Kalis was a queen of Lyria in the early 13th century.
Biography.
Kalis bore several daughters to her husband, but no son. She refused to allow her daughter Meve to have any lessons in fencing, thus forcing the princess to practice in secret.
At one point, after giving birth to another daughter, her husband became annoyed and secretly hired a magical assassin to eliminate her. When Kalis and her infant daughter were returning from her trip to Vengerberg accompanied by Yennefer and a group of guards, the convoy was attacked by a krallach controlled by the assassin. Yennefer managed to teleport Kalis into different locations numerous times but each time the assassin with his monster followed; at last, when Yennefer dissappeared, Kalis was left with the assassin alone. She begged him to leave her, promising to give birth to a son and proposing to kill only the infant daughter, but the assassin ignored her pleas and telekinetically threw a knife, slitting the queen's throat.

Bill of exchange

Bill of exchange is a special quest item in "", originally intended to be exchanged for crowns at the Vivaldi Bank in Novigrad. Many of them were supposed to appear throughout the game, possibly even as forms of payment for contract quests. However, the entire concept was cut and (functional) bills of exchange don't appear during gameplay, even though the mechanic is fully implemented. There is still one document bearing the same name that is obtainable, but it can't be cashed in.

This is a version that was cut from the game. It still exists in the game files, but can only be obtained through console commands. The item is fully functional and, if present in the inventory, an extra dialogue option with Vimme Vivaldi will be available: "Got a bill of exchange to redeem." When chosen, Geralt has a short line saying almost exactly the same thing, to which Vivaldi replies with "I'll need a spell to verify that the issuer's credit worthy. But it shouldn't take long." 100 are then received.
It is yet unclear if there was a specific reason why it is tied to Vimme Vivaldi, or if that's simply because his bank is where it is exchanged. Also, despite looking like a readable document (and actually flagged as such), it doesn't have a journal entry and can't be read.

Gwydberg

"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
Gwydberg Castle (from Elder Speech "Ard Gwyd": Sycamore Mountain) was a castle in Lower Angren and the former center of the cult of Morrigan.
Situated atop the sun-glittering mountain, the castle was defensible enough to counter many attacks. Its demise was brought not by a foreign army, but by the unconsciously casted curse of a priestess wronged by the castle's rulers.
History.
Since ancient times the intersection below the Holy Sycamore of Ard Gwyd had been considered as a seat of unnatural power, thought by Aen Seidhe elves to be an incarnation of "Mori Rígain". When Nordlings reached the area, they adapted elven beliefs into the cult of goddess Morrigan and built a castle on the mountain around the sacred tree. Many religious writings were produced here and the sanctuary became a destination of pilgrimages. The popularity of religion brought splendor to the castellans, who rose to position of counts of Gwydberg.
The situation changed around the late 1250s, when Countess Ailen of Gwydberg banished the last of priestesses, Vela, because the latter accused Ailen's husband Constans of raping her. Unconsciously, Vela cursed the castle and the Sycamore heard her plead. In a disastrous storm the fortress was severely damaged and ravens started to attack the inhabitants forcing them to flee. The sole residents of the former sanctuary became were priestess Vela and cursed Ailen's daughter, Iola of Gwydberg.
Gwydberg remained a ruin until early 1270s when it was reached by two expeditions, one led by Kala of Gwydberg, Queen Cirilla's vassal, and another by merchant Bruno Messmer. Members of the latter discovered that the Sycamore was in fact a prison of an otherwordly entity trapped here millennia ago. Depending on circumstances, the castle remained abandoned or became a possession of either Kala, disenchanted Iola or Bruno's men.

Battle of the village near Owl Hills

"That white-haired bloke... Gerard? Gerwant?" — The actual name of this subject is conjectural or unknown.
The battle of the village near Owl Hills was fought on 7 August 1267 between the Bruggian infantry defenders and the invading Nilfgaardian Army, who were supported by Verdenian cavalry and the Scoia'tael.
History.
After the beginning of the invasion of Brugge through Drieschot during the Second Northern War, the Imperials reached the unnamed village on the 7th. The defending infantry, holding out behind stone walls, fences, and upturned wagons, after roughly an hour had repulsed three attacks by the cavalry, who came charging at them from the causeway. The width of the causeway didn't permit the horsemen to gain enough momentum for a frontal attack, but allowed the foot soldiers to concentrate their defence. As a result, waves of cavalry repeatedly foundered on the barricades, behind which the desperate but fierce soldiers were shooting a hail of quarrels and arrows into the mounted throng. The cavalry seethed and teemed under this assault, and then the defenders rushed at them in a rapid counter-attack, fighting furiously with battle-axes, guisarmes, and studded flails. The cavalry retreated to the ponds, leaving human and equine corpses behind, while the infantry concealed themselves among the barricades and hurled filthy insults at the enemy. After a while, the cavalry formed up and attacked once again, which resulted in another small victory for the Bruggians.
After a while, another attack descended on the Bruggian infantry, but this time from two sides simultaneously; Verdenians galloped along the causeway, while a powerful cavalry force in black clocks dashed out from behind the ponds, striking the defender's flank. The Bruggian infantry stood no chance; the cavalry forced their way through the barricades and ripped the defenders apart with their swords. Some of the infantrymen laid down their arms and surrendered; others tried to escape towards the trees. But as they ran a third unit emerged from the trees and attacked; a mixed band of light Scoia'tael cavalry.
The captives were driven into a huddle, surrounded by a ring of soldiers. On the orders of a knight in a black-plumed helmet, the horsemen began to slash and stab the unarmed villagers, who were trampled by horses as they fell. The village was then burned to the ground and abandoned.

Biography.
Ealdred had only a handful of memories from his life before being taken to Kaer Seren. One of the few he recalled vividly was riding through open fields on horseback with his father. He once told Rodolf that this memory helped him endure the painful mutations, offering a small but vital anchor to normalcy amidst the trauma. Rodolf speculated that this might have been the only truly happy memory Ealdred had of his childhood.
During their numerous hunts together, Ealdred was often accompanied by Rodolf, who admired the witcher's good humor and skill in battle. Ealdred had a knack for keeping the mood light, frequently telling jokes to ease the tension. On one particularly memorable hunt, he impressed Rodolf by wrestling a muzzle onto a werewolf in Angren, a feat that left the dwarf in awe. Another time, they slew a fiend together, and Ealdred generously allowed Rodolf to keep its prized third eye as a memento of the kill.
When Rodolf once asked Ealdred why he continued the perilous life of a witcher, Ealdred's response was simple and tinged with melancholy: he didn’t know how to do anything else.

"The 27th of Blathe"
"We have tried everything, Magic rituals do not work, the gods cannot be moved by sacrifices, nor do the methods of scholars show results. All we have done was for naught. The cold is more and more overwhelming, and snow falls constantly. We no longer know what to do."
"The 17th of Feainn"
"At the mayor's request I went to the mages of Tor Gleavi'ch to ask how to arrest the changes to our climate. Sadly, they, too, are powerless. They claim the frost comes from some opening between the worlds, though I do not know if I understand them properly. One way or another, the snows do not relent."
"The 35th of Feainn"
"It grows worse every day. The mayor has ordered everyone who can to gather in the lighthouse. We are to bring warm clothing, supplies and fuel. He hopes together we will find survival easier. People walk there slowly, bundles of wood scavenged from furniture strapped to their backs. In this weather even a meager fire is sweeter than honey."
"The 6th of Lammas"
"Most who once lived in this city are now dead. The few who might live still cannot be reached - snow has buried every home. Only a few chimneys stick out in the whiteness. We are almost out of fuel and food. I feel that we will not make it much longer."

Antherions are animals who are able to transform into humanoids or humanoid/animal hybrids. Unlike therianthropes, who are humans or nonhumans that are able to shapeshift due to a curse, antherions are a distinct species. Some of them, however, reproduce similarly to cursed creatures – aguaras, for example, are said to be created through the transformation of abducted elven girls.
Note that antherions should not be confused with polymorphism, which is a rare magical ability that both humanoid and non-humanoid creatures may possess.

Biography.
Nissail observed wild cats, such as domesticated ocelots which protected elven palaces. Basing on these observations, he created "Addan Aenye": a fighting style favouring speed and agility over strength of blows.
The fighting style gained remarkable popularity among elven aristocracy. Even some witcher schools took an inspiration from Nissail's thoughts.

Letter from Yennefer to Emhyr var Emreis is a quest item in "".
At the start of the Battle Preparations quest, it is given by Yennefer to Geralt, to give to Emhyr in order to demand the release of Fringilla Vigo during the subquest Veni Vidi Vigo.
"Your Imperial Majesty,"
"Allow me to remind you that our arrangement encompassed all the sorceresses wishing to take part in the risky endeavor whose success is so vital to us. I find it hard to believe that in the current situation, when I have already succeeded in gathering so many members of the Lodge, you would refuse to allow Fringilla Vigo to join our company.I understand there are personal factors that make you reluctant to part with your subject, but I assure you our interests are aligned in those matters as well.I promise that I will uphold the conditions of our arrangement, despite the fact that they will demand sacrifices of me and will leave me in an unfortunate situation."
"I therefore request, politely yet with great insistence, that you release Fringilla."
"With all due respect,Yennefer"

The Band of Brethren (group)

The Band of Brethren is a group of veterans from a war with Nilfgaard.
History.
The Band of Brethren is a loose group of 5 veterans, who all served in the same unit, that formed after the war has ended. The unit consisted of
According to Griffarin, the group, that always looked out for each other during the war, at some point had enough of the fighting, the pillaging and the horrors of war and turned civilian, yearning to earn an honest living. They chose straws to decide whether to move to Oxenfurt, Maribor, Cintra, or Vizima, ultimately choosing the latter.
They fought at the Battle of Sodden Hill.

Nilfgaardian's wraith

The Nilfgaardian's wraith was the ghost of a former Nilfgaardian soldier who fought in Aedirn during the Second Northern War.
Biography.
When he was still alive, the unnamed soldier was part of a detachment whose task was to hide a treasure near Flotsam. Eventually the soldier was captured by some Aedirnian scouts, who brought him in a nearby asylum where two medics named Rupert Brandhuber and Gridley interrogated him, learning thus the location of the hidden treasure. After the Nilfgaardian soldier drawed a map representing the treasure's location, he was finally killed. After his death however, the other inmates of the hospital started a revolt and the place was burned to the ground. At last, only a woman among the inmates managed to escape the structure, taking with her even the treasure map.
Years later the wraith of the soldier summoned again Rupert and Gridley in the ruins of the hospital to get revenge, demanding their hearts and their eyes.
"If Geralt surrenders Rupert and Gridley to the wraith:" In the end Geralt didn't take the defense of the two medics, who were both killed by the Nilfgaardian's wraith.
"If Geralt tricks the wraith:" Geralt tried to trick the wraith by giving him some Nekker eyes and heart. The ghost however found out the catch and attacked the witcher, thus dying by his blade.

Great Sea civilization

"That white-haired bloke... Gerard? Gerwant?" — The actual name of this subject is conjectural or unknown.
Deep in the waters of the Great Sea, at least three intelligent races – merpeople, marine sorceresses and nereids – thrive together forming an advanced yet peaceful civilization. This society is separate from that of the vodyanoy and the two sometimes clash against each other.
History.
Although the origins of the three races are shrouded in mystery, they certainly track back centuries before the arrival of Nordlings in the 8th century, as the merpeople and nereids were already found in the sea.
The appearance of the nature-loving Aen Seidhe had a significant impact on the Great Sea races, who based their melodic language on the elven Elder Speech. They fought humans on occasion but by the 1250s began to shun from contact with the surface-dwellers.
Society.
Structure of the society.
The underwater society and culture are said to be less developed than those of the land dwellers, suggesting a kind of anarchist community. The merepeople seem to be the most prominent race, while the nereids guard the sea from threats. They appear to have liberal views when it comes to homosexual or non-monogamous relationships, at least amongst the merfolk.
The role analogous to Nordling and Nilfgaardian magic users is occupied by so-called sea witches, the "fucusyas". These marine sorceresses are highly esteemed by other inhabitants of the sea and are reportedly more skilled than human mages in terms of mutating or transforming living creatures: they can change a human into mereperson or otherwise without effort which would occur when a human mage similarly attempted the procedure.
Military.
The inhabitants of the Great Sea seem to rarely use weapons and rely on the help of sharks, dolphins, hippocampi and gargantuan krakens in battle. Tritons are often trained to use tridents in combat. Their most common enemy are vodyanoy, but sometimes they clash with humans when "dh'oine" damage the sea and its creatures too much.

Sea dialect

The sea dialect is a language spoken by merpeople, nereids and "marine sorceresses" forming the Great Sea civilization. It is considered to be sung, euphonious variant of the Elder Speech and is distinct from the Vodyan language.

Thjjn was a warrior who led werebbubbs of the Kestrel Mountains in their last stand against human armies.
Biography.
Before attacking, humans sent a heavily-armored envoy to try to negotiate the Kestrels' mines from werebbubbs. As negotiations failed they besieged the mountains, but Thjjn would have none of it. He rallied his people, donned his ancestral armor and prepared for war.
Outnumbered ten to one, werebbubbs clashed bravely with humans in the middle of the rain, led by Thjjn with axe in hand. Despite initial success, partially caused by humans' difficulties with mud, Thjjn was pushed into a mine. His frustration increased, as every time he killed a man two more showed up. Realizing the cause was lost, Thjjn began swinging his axe around in order to break support pillars, thus making the cave collapse on humans and himself.
Months later, humans dug out the mine again. Inside they found Thjjn's body and his surprisingly undamaged armor made of leather and meteorite. A saying goes Thjjn's strength lives on in the armor.

The friend of Dziega was an assimilated werebbubb in Blaviken.
Biography.
In the 1230s, the werebbubb was drinking beer with his vran friend when Dandelion came and asked if he could join. Although Dziega disagreed, the werebbubb poured a goblet for the bard to "support art". As a sign of gratitude, Dandelion promised to write about the werebbubb's generosity in one of his ballads.
Moments later, the infamous butchering ensued. The werebbubb stood in the crowd of onlookers with Dandelion and Dziega, latter of which warned him to not comment, afraid nearby humans would get mad at the werebbubb for weighing in and behead him. Believing Renfri's band, outnumbering Geralt of Rivia six to one, would defeat a witcher, the werebbubb was utterly surprised when Geralt won.

Adalbert was born at some point prior 1270s. In 1272, he reportedly visited the rock where Birna was chained, in order to witness and document her "noble suffering". Alas, a gust tore a scroll from his hand and slapped her across the face, which Adalbert much regretted.

Officially, Will Tether was developed in order to protect the lives of people with suicidal tendencies – at least according to the Supreme Council's statement. In truth, it found a variety of uses in the security services, where it is used to control restive individuals. There are also gossips about slaves bound by this spell kept in the mages' towers.
As Mind Tether is more complicated than basic Mind commands, it requires drawing power from Earth so that the spell can last.

"Elder Hoog once instructed his secretary, Gromek, to prepare a list of all the caves, caverns, and grottos in Mahakam. None ever learned why such information had become a priority for the Elder-in-Chief. Perhaps Brouver needed the record for a highly secretive task, or perhaps he had simply fallen into a sour mood and wished to bring the secretary down with him. In any case, the census of Mahakam's underground caverns was never completed, for Gromek had disappeared without a trace... None ever discovered his true fate, yet bones that continue to pile up and gather dust a the threshold of Mahakam's darkest caves serve well enough to spark one's imagination..."

Draconid Instinct is a subquest in "".
Walkthrough.
After completing Spring Cleaning, you'll meet Brouver Hoog. Speak to him and Gabor Zigrin, and then head up the path to start this encounter.
Meve and her army encounter over a bridge Ferenc clan dwarves wheeling their weekly cartloads of offerings to the dragon Keltullis. One wagon is blocking all traffic, but is soon repaired by Xavier Lemmens. Meve can choose whether to take 100 gold as a reward, or not.
Further on the road, the warband meets the dragon itself, which, despite assurances of the dwarves that it has been a good neighbor for three hundred years, is burning down The Hag's Pit. If Eyck of Denesle is in the party he will charge the dragon on sight, you can choose to fight with him, prompting the Fury of Keltullis battle, or leave him to his fate, making you lose the knight.
After the battle Keltullis flees, and the Ferenc leader, Vavrinek, asks the queen to go finish the beast off before it can regenerate. You can then decide whether to pursue it or not. Once at Keltullis' lair, you can choose to hear it out or kill it outright.
"If Meve hears her out:" Keltullis complained of being poisoned, which intrigued Meve enough to hear the dragon out. It turned out Keltuills was a female dragon, as revealed by Ferenc dwarves coming in and smashing her eggs. They had only poisoned her (with the meat carried in the before-encountered convoy) and smashed her eggs because they feared having to supply more dragons and face a larger threat, a move quite appreciated by Eyck of Denesle. Angered by the dwarves smashing her eggs, and not being hit with enough poison to kill, Keltillus flew to the nearest town.
"If Meve kills Keltullis:" already awaiting her fate, Keltullis lay on the ground as Meve ended her life. Several of Meve's company seemed to object to ending the creatures life so quick. This gives you the Keltullis Trophy card, as well as 10,000 gold from the dragon's hoard.
After hearing her out:
"If Meve follows and kills Keltullis:" knowing how much of a threat the dragon posed and seeking justice for the previous massacre, Meve decided to finally kill Keltullis, with a strong cut to the stomach, ending the life of the last red dragon between the Great Sea and the Fiery Mountains. This gives you the Keltullis Trophy card, as well as 10,000 gold from the dragon's hoard.
"If Meve lets Keltullis heal and leave Mahakam:" angered at how the dwarves had treated the dragon, Meve allowed Keltullis to heal and leave Mahakam afterwards. You receive 10,000 gold from the dragon out of gratitude. This option makes Eyck of Denesle leave the party, as he's outraged that a monster should be allowed to be left alive.
Either sparing or killing the dragon gives you 10,000 gold (if you choose to fight her and then follow her to her lair), the most important consequence is then to either have Eyck of Denesle leave your party by sparing Keltullis, or to slay her and gain her trophy.

Lazlo is a high-ranking Cintran nobleman, being a knight and member of the military.
Biography.
Defending Princess Ciri.
Princess Ciri is playing a game of knucklebones in the streets of Cintra when Sir Lazlo arrives to take her back to the castle, where she attends a knight induction ceremony headed by her grandmother and grandfather, Queen Calanthe and King Eist. Afterward, they discuss the encroachment of Nilfgaard. Should they fall, Ciri will rise to throne.
Sir Lazlo and Mousesack lock Ciri in her room and watch over her while the king and queen lead an army into battle against Nilfgaardian invaders. Lazlo reveals that protecting her is his highest honor. Mousesack tells Ciri the tale of how sorcerers used to lock little girls up in towers because the girls were said to announce the end of the human race, and so they were systematically killed. She asks Mousesack if her grandmother will be alright. He replies that she, Ciri, will be alright.
After several days away at battle, Queen Calanthe returns to the castle badly wounded, without the king, who died during battle. The queen is bleeding, and Cintra is under attack. Calanthe assures Ciri that one day she will rule Cintra.
As night falls, the Nilfgaardians breach the castle gates. In the face of defeat, Queen Calanthe orders the entire castle to commit suicide by poison, to spare them the fate of being tortured and murdered by the Nilfgaardians invaders. Calanthe decides to stay behind, sending Ciri off with Sir Lazlo and Mousesack, telling her to find Geralt of Rivia, as he is her destiny. On her way out, Ciri screams, causing a magical pulse.
Sir Lazlo, Mousesack, and Ciri escape the castle through an underground tunnel. Mousesack stays behind to fend off invading Nilfgaardians. As Ciri and Lazlo attempt to flee the city on horseback, Lazlo is killed with an arrow by Cahir, pulling Ciri off the horse and onto the ground.
Pre-Nilfgaard massacre.
Just days prior to Nilfgaard's attack on Cintra, Lazlo, Danek, and Queen Calanthe discussed the encroachment of Nilfgaard. She then came face-to-face with Geralt of Rivia for the first time in 12 years. Geralt came to protect Ciri, who Calanthe raised on her own. When Calanthe tried to buy Geralt off, Mousesack interjected that money couldn't undo the Law of Surprise. King's who've tried to outbid destiny ended up on pikes. Lazlo and Danek drew their blades as Geralt approached. He advises Calanthe to give the child over to him if she had any doubt in her mind that Ciri wasn't safe in Cintra. Geralt promised to take her, protect, and bring her back unharmed. Calanthe reluctantly agreed and exclaimed to the townspeople that Law of Surprise had been called.

The End's Beginning

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"The End's Beginning" is the first episode of Netflix's "The Witcher" series and is based on the short story "The Lesser Evil".
"Hostile townsfolk and a cunning mage greet Geralt in the town of Blaviken. Ciri finds her royal world upended when Nilfgaard sets its sights on Cintra."
Summary.
Geralt's timeline.
Geralt of Rivia, a witcher, bursts forth from a bog in combat with a kikimora. Although the kikimora initially has the upper hand, Geralt manages to ram his sword through her skull, killing her. He then takes the kikimora to Blaviken for sale, but finds himself untrusted by the locals. Renfri calls off her guards and gets Geralt a drink, convincing everyone to leave him be. Marilka then arrives and directs Geralt to speak with "Master Irion", "our wizard" who might be willing to pay for the kikimora. Irion turns out to be Stregobor, a sorcerer in hiding who only took the name Irion from the long-dead creator of the tower he was living in. Geralt deduces that Stregobor wanted to hire him, and so Stregobor reveals that he wants Geralt to assassinate Renfri.
To elaborate on his reasoning, Stregobor explains to Geralt that the Curse of the Black Sun, a solar eclipse, left numerous women born on or near that day internally mutated. This was taken as confirmation of the mage-prophet Eltibald's prediction that 60 women born at that time would usher in the return of Lilit, along with the extermination of the human race. To prevent this, Stregobor and numerous other sorcerers hunted down and killed or imprisoned these women, and although they attempted to cure those they imprisoned, the women always died. They performed autopsies on those who died to confirm their unnatural mutations, and continued hunting for those women in the hope of preventing the prophecy from being realized.
To this end, Stregobor reveals that he sought to kill Renfri, the last of those women, a princess born while the eclipse was at its peak. She escaped his assassin however, and hunted for Stregobor ever since, being immune to his magic due to her mutations. To save himself from her vengeance, and to save the world from the prophecy, Stregobor attempts to hire Geralt to kill her, but Geralt refuses.
Outside Blaviken, Renfri tracks down Geralt, demanding to know where Stregobor is so that she can kill him, claiming that the assassin he sent after her actually raped her. She threatens to slaughter her way through Blaviken if he does not kill Stregobor, but he is unmoved. As a fellow mutant, Renfri asks Geralt why he wouldn't kill people if they came after him as people had attempted to kill her, to which he says that doing so would make him what they say he is; a monster. He advises her to simply leave Blaviken, and departs.
Later on, Renfri follows Geralt to his camp, where he has just finished recounting his first monster kill to his horse, Roach. She sits with him, claiming her intention to leave Blaviken. They then kiss, and have sex into the night.
As Geralt dreams of his night with Renfri, he hears her tell him of his future, that he would be driven out of Blaviken with stones and that the "girl in the woods" is his destiny that he cannot escape. He awakens alone, knowing that Renfri intends to slaughter her way through Blaviken until she finds Stregobor. Geralt goes to Blaviken to stop her, and easily dispatches her company of soldiers that attempt to stop him.
Geralt then confronts Renfri, warning her to leave Blaviken with a display of magic, to which she says magic has no effect on her; only silver does, as with monsters. Then, despite having Marilka at swordpoint and intending to use her as a hostage, Renfri quickly releases Marilka and attacks Geralt directly. She lands several cuts on Geralt before he eventually disarms her, leaving her with only a dagger. Although he lowers his sword to stop the fight, she attacks with her dagger, which he redirects into her own throat. As she lies in Geralt's arms, Renfri reiterates that Ciri is Geralt's destiny, that she will be with him "always," before finally dying of blood loss.
In the aftermath, Stregobor walks through the carnage of Geralt's duel with Renfri's men. He eventually finds Renfri's corpse, and reveals his intent to do an autopsy on her. When Geralt strenuously objects, Stregobor explains that her mutation allows her to influence people around her, as she did by bending her company of soldiers to her will, and that she must be examined. When Geralt is unmoved, Stregobor then realizes that Geralt himself was similarly influenced, so rather than pay him for the assassination, Stregobor instead brings attention to the piles of bodies Geralt had left in his wake. This incenses the townspeople, even Marilka, against Geralt as a murderous witcher. They then throw stones at him until he leaves, as Renfri predicted.
Ciri's timeline.
In the streets of Cintra, Princess Ciri is playing a game of knucklebones when Sir Lazlo arrives and takes her back to the Cintran citadel. There, she attends a ceremony to induct new knights, before retiring to a celebratory feast. There Queen Calanthe and King Eist discuss the encroachment of Nilfgaard. They send their granddaughter Ciri to dance until Sir Danek arrives, informing them of Nilfgaard's imminent attack.
Outside Cintra, Calanthe and Eist meet the Nilfgaardian invaders on the field rather than using fortifications or waiting for their fleet of ships to aid them. Despite the Nilfgaardians' lack of cavalry against the Cintrans, their numbers allow them to overwhelm the Cintrans, whose ships were further delayed due to a storm and unable to assist them. King Eist eventually takes an arrow through the eye from Cahir, dying instantly, so Queen Calanthe retreats in mourning.
In the Cintran capital, Ciri waits impatiently for Calanthe's return with her protector Sir Lazlo and her druid Mousesack. After several days, Calanthe returns, badly wounded. She speaks with Ciri, assuring her that she will rule Cintra one day, until Mousesack reports that the Nilfgaardians have breached both outer walls of the Cintran capital, the walls entirely undefended after the ruinous battle on the field decreased their numbers. As the Nilfgaardians close in on the citadel, Mousesack erects a magical barrier around the gate to keep the Nilfgaardians at bay.
The Nilfgaardians proceed to barrage the barrier with flaming arrows well into the night, eventually wearing down Mousesack's barrier and breaching the gate. Mousesack reports this to Calanthe, and she orders her entire castle to commit suicide by poison, to spare them from being murdered by Nilfgaardians. She then sends her granddaughter Ciri away, under Lazlo and Mousesack's protection, telling her to find Geralt of Rivia. Before leaving, Ciri screams in denial, causing a magical reverberation throughout the room.
With Ciri and Lazlo departed, Calanthe explains to Mousesack that Ciri is the reason why the Nilfgaardians came for Cintra. Mousesack then leaves Calanthe alone, determined to protect Ciri, and escorts her to the edge of the city. There they are seen by numerous invading soldiers, so Mousesack stays behind to hold them off while Lazlo and Ciri escape. Eventually, as they flee the city on horseback, Cahir hunts them down and kills Lazlo with an arrow. Even as Cahir takes Ciri captive, all of the Cintran nobility drink poison and die, and Calanthe herself jumps out of a window to her death.
On the outskirts of Cintra, Cahir continues on his way with Ciri in tow. However, while she watches her city burn in the distance, she becomes enraged and screams again, releasing an even more powerful magic pulse through the area. This spooks Cahir's horse, who drops them both. Although Cahir tries to grab Ciri, she simply screams again, paining Cahir and forcing him to release her. She flees, and screams so loudly that an entire stone monolith collapses and falls between them, creating a rift in the ground that allows Ciri to escape without pursuit.

Faithel

The Faithel, outside Zerrikania mistaken sometimes with Free Warriors"', are Zerrikanian female warriors who roam the Continent outside their native country in order to search for dragons and protect them from danger.
Overview.
These of "cule mailteini", that is teenage girls after 15, spend next 6 or more years in Faithel School on learning "saberra" swordmanship, sharpening their senses, and reflex conditioning. After finishing the school, every half a year they participate in the First Blood Tournament. Two best fighters receive a third belt of tattoo, are anointed by priestessess and blessed by the ruler, and set out outside the borders to look for dragons, venturing as far as the Dragon Mountains.
Faithel travel and fight in pairs. Their goal is to find a dragon, honour it and swear their allegiance, and, depending on the dragon's choice, escort it to Zerrikania or stay with it.
History.
The name "Faithel" was first given to six warrioresses who accompanied Saulrenith and five other priestesses on their journey to Northern Kingdoms. The expedition, aim of which was to find dragons and spread their cult, met tragic climax 4 years after the beginning: after the news of the hunt for a green dragon in Mahakam reached them, Zerrikanians failed to protect the creature and only Saulrenith with three Faithel survived the fight with dwarves.
When the survivors returned to Zerrikania, the then-queen Merineaevelth decided to found a Faithel School named after them.
In early 1250s, Faithel Téa and Véa found a golden dragon Villentretenmerth and became his guardians.

Four Marks

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"Four Marks" is the second episode of Netflix's "The Witcher" series. It is based on the short story "The Edge of the World".
"Bullied and neglected, Yennefer accidentally finds a means of escape. Geralt's hunt for a so-called devil goes to hell. Ciri seeks safety in numbers."
Summary.
Geralt's timeline.
Geralt drinks in a tavern to drown his sorrows until Jaskier, a mediocre bard, comes up to him and insists on a review of his performance. Geralt only tells him that the creatures in his song do not exist, prompting Jaskier to realize that he is a witcher, which he immediately announces. Hearing this, a farmer named Nettly pays him 100 Ducats up front to kill a "devil" stealing his grain, and Jaskier tags along.
With Geralt, Jaskier is still following him while he tries to hunt down the "devil," eventually ending up knocked out by a Sylvan named Torque, who attacks Geralt. As Geralt holds Torque down, an elf attacks him from behind and knocks him out as well.
Jaskier and Geralt awaken to find themselves bound and harassed by Toruviel, an elf who is sick. Filavandrel, king of the elves, reveals that he had the Sylvans steal food and medicine for them to help their sick and starving populace, driven out from their homes by force. This confuses Jaskier, who thought the elves graciously left the land to retire to "golden" palaces, when in actuality they were simple caves.
Geralt advises Filavandrel to move elsewhere and to rebuild if he refuses to integrate with humans, and claims not to be human, so Filavandrel lets him go. Geralt leaves his bounty with the elves in thanks, and Jaskier sings a new song he created from the experience while Geralt follows behind him.
Yennefer's timeline.
In Vengerberg, two lovers notice Yennefer, a hunchbacked girl who tries to kindly return their flower. They attack Yennefer however, disgusted by her appearance, and she instinctively creates a portal to teleport away. This use of magic marks her, so Istredd, a man she met on the other side of her portal, creates an untraceable portal to send her back to Vengerberg. In Vengerberg, a witch named Tissaia traces and buys Yennefer from her father for four marks; less than half the price of a pig, at ten marks. Despite her mother's protestations and Yennefer's reluctance to go, Yennefer is taken unwillingly from her home and locked in a room in Aretuza. There Yennefer breaks down, missing her mother, and shatters the mirror in her room before contemplating suicide.
Yennefer eventually attempts to kill herself, requiring Tissaia's intervention to save her. Yennefer is then brought to the garden, where Tissaia demonstrates the use of magic; one can channel "chaos" to make things happen, but not without a price, as demonstrated when one initiate had her arm shriveled up in the attempt. All other initiates used a flower to power their spells, but Yennefer was unable to use magic at all. Dejected, Yennefer seeks out Istredd and introduces herself.
After several weeks in Aretuza, Yennefer has fallen far behind her peers, unable to perform simple tasks to the point that she attempts to lie to cover up her inadequacies, which Tissaia immediately identifies and berates her for. With Istredd, he helps her to read his mind, and reveals memories of cicadas and other cheerful things to her. Later, Yennefer is woken up and brought to Tor Lara to bottle lightning, which she fails to do, the lightning striking her squarely. Enraged, Yennefer launches the lightning outward, forcing Tissaia to redirect it back up into the sky. Afterward, Tissaia berates Yennefer for being at chaos' whim, rather than controlling it and herself.
Later on, Yennefer fears she will be sent home for her incompetence, away from Istredd. In response, Istredd shows her the skulls of elves beneath Aretuza, elves who originally built Aretuza, and who first taught humans how to turn chaos into magic. He explains that the humans slaughtered them in return, and gives her Feainnewedd, an herb that only grows wherever Elder Blood was spilt. Using this plant, Yennefer easily creates a portal on her first attempt, and she reveals that her real father was half-elven, the mixing of the two races resulting in her twisted spine. Istredd then kisses Yennefer, and it is later revealed that he was actually working for Stregobor, and Istredd reveals Yennefer's elven heritage to him.
While Yennefer waits for Tissaia to confirm if she will "ascend" or not, she gets impatient and decides to spy on Tissaia, where she finds Tissaia transforming her friends into eels. Tissaia prompts Yennefer to push them into the water, saying that "sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die". When Yennefer does so, all of Aretuza lights up with magic.
Ciri's timeline.
While hiding, Ciri notices a search party of soldiers calling out for her, so she takes cover behind a tree, using mud to paint her hair black. When she tries to eat some berries for food, Dara, an elf, appears and stops her from eating them due to their poison. He initially does not speak in order to hide his elven accent, but Ciri reveals that Cahir is hunting her, and has Dara douse their fire so that she will not be captured. After giving Dara one of her gloves, she joins a Cintran refugee camp when she sees it, although Dara does not follow. In the camp, Ciri is shocked to see everyone angry at their dead queen for allowing Cintra to fall. A boy named Adon meets her, and invites her to join his family briefly, who give her new shoes and let her sleep in their tent.
While Ciri sleeps in the refugee camp, the Nilfgaardians converge on the area, sending the family she was staying with into a panic. The woman who comforted Ciri the night before angrily orders her slave, Abbott, to collect her things while she was fleeing, but he finally snaps and angrily knifes her to death. While Ciri watches it happen, Dara cuts through the tent and pulls her to safety, noticing the corpse of Adon while she flees. In the woods outside the refugee camp, Ciri also discovers that Dara is an elf.

Betrayer Moon

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"Betrayer Moon" is the third episode of Netflix's "The Witcher" series and will be based on the short story "The Witcher".
"Geralt takes on another Witcher's unfinished business in a kingdom stalked by a ferocious beast. At a brutal cost, Yennefer forges a magical new future."
Summary.
Geralt's timeline.
In Temeria, a monster is killing local workers. One such worker's son, Mikal, lies dying from severe gashes, recounting the story of a monster coming out on the full moon to attack him. A witcher named Remus offers to kill the beast for 3,000 orens up front. The worker pays his fee, pooled from several other workers who had suffered attacks, and when he turns back to Mikal he finds him dead from his injuries. While the worker mourns, Remus sets out to kill the monster, but is killed by it instead.
Meanwhile, Geralt of Rivia has just finished using the services of a prostitute, who tells him that Remus passed through there on his way to Temeria. Concerned over the rumor that Remus vanished with the gold, Geralt then sets out after Remus, vowing to pay back his debts to an innkeeper when he returns. He leaves Roach behind as a deposit.
When Geralt arrives in Temeria, he finds the workers on the brink of revolt. He offers his services to them as Remus did, and although they accuse Remus of swindling them, Geralt claims to take his pay after the job is done and at a third of the price. Geralt also offers his apologies for Remus' behavior, and nearly wins them over, until Ostrit arrives with several soldiers. He demands the workers disperse in exchange for not charging them with treason, and tries to persuade them that vengeance will not ease their pain, but they simply storm off angrily. Ostrit then has Geralt escorted out of Temeria.
En route, Geralt's guards all fall asleep and tumble off of their horses. Triss Merigold then reveals herself, and hires Geralt to free the monster of a curse. Triss explains that they managed to identify that the attacks were emanating from the crypt where Princess Adda was buried. There were rumors that she was with child, and if true, then that child would be the sole heir to the Temerian throne, indicating that this monster might be Adda's cursed unborn child.
Geralt initially presumes the creature to be a vukodlak, but Triss dismisses it. She brings him to examine several corpses and offers 2,000 orens to identify the monster that killed them. After examining Remus' corpse, Geralt surmises that Triss covered up his death to hide the fact that the monster had actually defeated a Witcher. On further examination, Geralt discovers that Remus is only missing his heart and liver; only a striga, a cursed female, has eating habits that selective. Geralt then identifies that it is Adda's daughter, a princess, who has turned into a monstrous striga.
Geralt is then brought before King Foltest, where Triss Merigold pleads with everyone to enlist Geralt's help. One of his courtiers, Segelin, is suspicious however, wondering who would possibly want to kill Adda, to which Geralt brought up her "lover". This gives Foltest pause even as Segelin dismisses this, so Triss argues to simply open up the crypt so that they can investigate. Segelin continues his tirade, claiming that Geralt would simply kill the "princess," at which point Geralt describes in detail how a striga is horrifically mutated into a creature of the night. When he goes so far as to call it an "overgrown abortion," King Foltest orders everyone out.
As people begin to leave, Geralt throws Segelin out and bars the door, interrogating Foltest over who the father of the striga is. He wants to know why Foltest never married, why he did not simply kill the striga and produce his own heir, driving to the point that Foltest himself sired the striga with his sister in an incestuous relationship. Enraged, Foltest says that Geralt must be devoid of all emotion to accuse him of bedding his own sister while simultaneously advocating that he kill his own daughter. As his guards break through the door, he halts them and simply orders Geralt to leave and never return.
Rather than leave as bidden, Geralt and Triss sneak into the crypt and discover letters from the Sancia of Sodden, Adda's mother. The letters urged Adda to stop being involved with Foltest, so they bring the letters to Ostrit with their suspicion that the queen herself cursed Adda. Ostrit suspects that Foltest in fact raped Adda, and that Foltest cursed her to cover it up. Geralt nearly buys this story, until he mentions that Ostrit's scent was "on her sheets," having smelled the bed in the crypt.
Fingered as Adda's illicit lover, Ostrit claims that his actions of cursing Adda's child were justified. He could have simply exposed the incest, but he never wanted to hurt Adda, and was distraught when his curse killed her. He now seeks to keep her memory from being "sullied," and refuses to tell Geralt how to lift the curse. In response, Geralt simply knocks him out.
Geralt goes to the crypt to lift the curse, but finds Foltest himself standing before the entrance. Thanks to Triss' advice to trust Geralt, Foltest gives Geralt his blessing to save the striga. He asks if his daughter will be normal, to which Geralt says she will need rehabilitative care due to her early life spent as an animal. Geralt then leaves a gift with Foltest; for the striga, in case the curse is lifted but Geralt dies in the process.
Within the crypt, Geralt has Ostrit tied to the same bed where he had relations with Adda, where the striga can reach him. Geralt refuses to release him until he reveals how to lift the curse, and although Ostrit eventually does so, Geralt breaks his word and leaves him to die. Ostrit begs, blaming Foltest and assuring the striga, who he was responsible for cursing, that he loved Adda. The striga kills him anyway.
Geralt is now faced with the task of keeping the striga out of her crypt until dawn to successfully lift the curse. His fight initially goes well, thrashing the creature around the decrepit castle, but it manages to close to grips with him and pin him down. In response, Geralt collapses the floor beneath them, crushing the striga in falling rubble.
After recovering, Geralt gets up and places a magical barrier over the entrance to the striga's crypt. When the striga runs for it, it is slammed bodily aside. Geralt then puts on some brass knuckles and punches the striga out, going into its crypt himself to keep it from getting inside. It screams in futile rage before finally disintegrating into a young girl, the curse lifted. When Geralt goes to touch her however, she embeds the last of her claws into his neck, and he bites her before passes out from blood loss.
Geralt awakens after having been healed by Triss. She tells him that King Foltest fabricated a story about how Ostrit bravely sacrificed himself to kill the striga, and that the miners would build a statue in his honor while in reality, the uncursed striga would go elsewhere for rehabilitation. Although Triss asks why Geralt continually spoke Renfri's name in his sleep, he only insists on taking his money and leaving. Triss gives him his money, returning his gift to the striga as well.
Yennefer's timeline.
Further in the past, at Aretuza, Yennefer and Istredd are having sex before an illusory audience. Afterward, they are concerned about being separated, due to Istredd being sent away for excavation of ruins while Yennefer is bound for Aedirn, her old homeland. Yennefer is also concerned about what she wants to look like when she is enchanted into a new person, and when Istredd prompts her, she says she only wants to go back to Aedirn and not be the frightened girl that she once was.
Meanwhile, a conclave of senior sorcerers, including Tissaia de Vries and Stregobor, discusses their concerns over Cintra refusing to use their court wizards. Cintra prefers Druids instead, and outright bans all mages from the kingdom; Princess Calanthe also opposes the influence of mages. Another issue is that Nilfgaard is ruled by the lecherous King Fergus, who spends his money on women while people starve.
Tissaia assures Stregobor that Fringilla Vigo, one of her apprentices, will be assigned to Nilfgaard to deal with the problem, but he objects due to her incompetence. He urges that Yennefer be sent there instead, but Tissaia insists that Yennefer would best thrive in Aedirn due to being a native, which the local king prefers. Stregobor counters this by saying that Aedirn is Cintra's largest trading partner, and that sending a quarter-elf, which Yennefer is, to work with Aedirn would further ostracize Cintra due to their fierce hatred of the elves.
This argument immediately convinces a majority of the chapter against sending Yennefer to Aedirn, seeking to prioritize returning Cintra to the fold above all. Tissaia then strikes out with an accusation of cowardice in Stregobor and an accusation of nepotism, sparing his niece Fringilla a difficult job, in Artorius Vigo. Artorius recuses himself after that accusation, but opens it up to a vote of the entire chapter, who overwhelmingly vote against Tissaia, ensuring that Yennefer would be assigned to Nilfgaard.
When Yennefer learns this, she angrily turns on Tissaia, saying that Fergus would rather "fondle his sorceress than listen to her". She accuses Tissaia of being overruled, and Tissaia reveals that it was because of Yennefer's elven blood that she was reassigned. Yennefer initially thinks that Tissaia revealed it, but Tissaia confirms that it was in fact Stregobor who brought it up, leading Yennefer to realize that Istredd revealed her secret to Stregobor.
Eventually Istredd catches on to the fact that Yennefer figured out his betrayal. He apologizes for his actions, even offering to take her with him on his research position, but she calls it "slow suicide" and rejects him. Istredd accuses her of simply being angry about not getting to become beautiful, to which she angrily says it is "what I am owed." Although Istredd cautions her that it will not be fulfilling, she rushes off anyway and gets the enchanter, Giltine, to agree to make her beautiful, even forsaking any sleeping and pain-numbing agents to get it done as quickly as possible.
While the ball is underway to match sorceresses with kings, young Foltest and Adda are seen fondling each other, as their mother scolds them to knock it out. While this happens, Yennefer undergoes her painful transformation, including a procedure that will leave her infertile by removing her reproductive organs, which are then used to create a magical paste which, when applied to her skin, begins the transformation. Her spine violently straightens, her jaw forcefully corrects itself, and her entire body takes the shape of an attractive woman, but not without immense pain during the process.
Afterwards, Yennefer then dons a dress and arrives at the ball as a completely new person, with members of the brotherhood and Istredd immediately taking notice. The king of Aedirn also notices her and, when Yennefer introduces herself as from Aedirn's capital of Vengerberg, the king discards Fringilla in favor of her, despite Tissaia trying to step in to stop Yennefer. Stregobor, Tissaia, Artorius, and Istredd all then look on in anger as Yennefer and the king dance.
Ciri's timeline.
Back in the present, Ciri awakens in a forest surrounded by snow. She falls under a spell, and walks mindlessly into Brokilon, home of the dryads. Dara, seeing Ciri walk through Brokilon's corpse-strewn border, tries to follow her but ends up shot by a dryad arrow as an entranced Ciri doesn't notice this and continues into the sacred forest.

Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"Of Banquets, Bastards and Burials" is the fourth episode of Netflix's "The Witcher" series and is based on the short story "A Question of Price".
"Against his better judgment, Geralt accompanies Jaskier to a royal ball. Ciri wanders into an enchanted forest. Yennefer tries to protect her charges."
Summary.
Geralt's timeline.
Jaskier is in a tavern, writing down the excited account of a merchant who hired Geralt to slay a selkiemore plaguing his shipments, only to watch in horror as the monster swallowed the Witcher whole. The merchant insists that Geralt could not have survived, but Jaskier knows better, and is proven right when Geralt himself walks into the tavern, covered head to toe in selkiemore guts, explaining that he had to slay it from the inside. The merchant hurriedly pays Geralt the agreed-upon fee, and the bar patrons clear a path for the reeking Witcher as he orders a tankard of beer to wash out his mouth.
Jaskier claims credit for making Geralt famous, but "generously" offers to waive his percentage of Geralt's fees and settle for one "teeny, tiny favor" - accompanying Jaskier as a bodyguard while he performs at a betrothal party in Cintra, since several of the nobles in attendance might recognize him as the man who cuckolded them with their various wives, concubines, and sometimes mothers. Against his better judgment, Geralt agrees.
Jaskier has Geralt wear high quality garb and tells him to stay silent and remain anonymous, but Mousesack immediately recognizes him and calls him out. Mousesack and Geralt walk the hall, and Mousesack fills Geralt in on the political situation.
Dozens of noble scions are there as potential suitors for Princess Pavetta's hand, since Queen Calanthe's army is the mightiest in the land, but it is all just a charade. The Queen and Eist Tuirseach of Skellige have already agreed to wed Pavetta to Eist's nephew, Crach an Craite. Mousesack confides that Eist himself proposed marriage to Calanthe three times after King Roegner died, but she turned him down each time.
Geralt quickly has to return to save Jaskier from a noble accusing Jaskier of cuckolding him. Geralt smoothly claims Jaskier to be a eunuch, and the lord leaves. The celebration is interrupted when Calanthe herself returns from a punitive expedition against some rebellious nobles. Still wearing her blood-smeared armour, Calanthe confronts her daughter and insist that she go through with the arranged marriage, for the sake of Cintra's future. Pavetta protests that she can't abide Crach, but Calanthe says Pavetta can have whatever man she wants, after she's married.
Eventually an argument breaks out between Crach and another noble about what a manticore looks like, and one of them angrily turns to Geralt. Geralt claims them both to be wrong, but diplomatically he allows that they might've encountered some "rare subspecies." When they bring up Jaskier's story of Geralt slaying elves, Geralt admits that he was actually captured by them, and the only heroic deed he can honestly claim is not crapping his pants when there was a blade to his throat. Laughing heartily, Calanthe salutes Geralt as the only man there willing to acknowledge his defeats rather than his successes. She asks Geralt to sit at her side as they dine. Privately, she admits to being fed up with all the "male" traditions she has to follow since becoming Queen, and if she had her way, she'd tell all the royal suitors to "f**k off". Knowing Geralt is a fighter and a killer, she asks if she can count on his sword if violence breaks out, but he refuses, saying he only kills genuine monsters.
The next suitor to vie for Pavetta's hand is Lord Peregrine of Nilfgaard (before it became powerful and while it was still under the rule of the Usurper). Despite constant interruptions from Draig Bon-Dhu, Peregrine manages to propose a marriage to "unite the jewels of the north and south", forging an "unbreakable alliance that none would dare cross". However, he goes overboard and disgusts Pavetta by mentioning his "potent seed", prompting Calanthe to dismiss Nilfgaard as the "shit rag of the south". She then questions his uneasy position as Nilfgaard's heir, and he storms off in rage as Lord Steergart of Kaedwen is called forth.
Calanthe asks Geralt why there are so few witchers left, and he explains that they cannot create any more after Kaer Morhen was sacked. Suddenly, Lord Urcheon of Erlenwald forces his way into the room and demands Pavetta's hand in marriage. Calanthe demands he remove his helmet and show his face, and when he refuses, Eist knocks it off.
Everyone is stunned to see that Urcheon looks more like a hedgehog than a human, and Calanthe immediately orders Geralt to "kill it". Geralt refuses, saying Urcheon is a cursed man, not a monster, so she orders her soldiers to slay him instead. Although Urcheon claims to own Pavetta under the Law of Surprise for saving King Roegner, the soldiers swarm him anyway. He initially holds them off single-handed.
Eventually one soldier manages to disarm Urcheon, but just as he prepares to kill him, Geralt intervenes and saves Urcheon. The pair then fight off the all of the soldiers together even as the suitors come forward to join the fray. Eist and several others hold the suitors off until eventually Calanthe herself grabs a sword and enters the absolute pandemonium, demanding that everyone stop.
Pavetta then rushes in to reach "Duny", Urcheon's common name, and berates him for not staying away. Urcheon disarms himself and confesses to Calanthe that he was cursed and suffered endlessly until he saved King Roegner from death. Calanthe claims that she'd rather he had died, revealing that she knew of Urcheon and ordered his death anyway. Eist reasons with her however, and Urcheon claims he never intended to claim the Law of Surprise at all, until one night after the curse broke he unintentionally met Pavetta, and they fell in love.
Eist and Mousesack both urge Calanthe to honor destiny, so she appeals to Geralt. Although he agrees with her that there is no "destiny", he insists that a promise made must be honored, as true for a commoner as for a queen. With pressure on all sides Calanthe seems to relent, pulling Urcheon close and whispering "here is your destiny" as she pulls out a knife to stab him. Just before she can however, Pavetta screams in denial and a magical pulse blasts through the room, knocking everyone except Urcheon away.
From the pulse comes a magical vortex of wind that keeps everyone to the edges of the room and lifts Pavetta and Urcheon into the air, Pavetta instinctively chanting in Elder Speech all the while. As the vortex accelerates and begins to threaten the integrity of the castle itself, Geralt struggles forward through the wind, failing to use signs to penetrate the vortex. After being pushed back, he drinks a potion and gains the fortitude to begin forcing his way forward, even as Mousesack slows the vortex with his magic. Geralt manages to get just close enough for Pavetta to notice him, at which point his sign cuts through the inner edges of the vortex and knocks her to the floor.
The vortex ceases instantly and everyone rises up from the rubble. Calanthe then relents in the face of destiny and honors the Law of Surprise, with Eist announcing that anyone who takes issue with Urcheon marrying Pavetta would face "the sea hounds of Skellige", as he himself is marrying Queen Calanthe.
Calanthe then blesses their marriage, and when Urcheon and Pavetta kiss, Urcheon miraculously turns into his human form; the curse has been lifted. Geralt then goes to leave, but Urcheon insists on repaying him for saving his life, insisting that he give Geralt something even when he claims to want nothing. At Urcheon's insistence, Geralt also claims the Law of Surprise and then tries to leave again, but Calanthe cries out in rejection at his action. He tries to calm Calanthe, having no intention of even returning to Cintra, but at that very moment Pavetta throws up; she is pregnant, and through the Law of Suprise, her child belongs to Geralt.
Geralt finally leaves while everyone stares at him in shock. Mousesack follows him, announcing his plans to stay and guide Pavetta, and invites Geralt to stay as well. Geralt doesn't want to, and although Mousesack insists that not taking his child surprise would unleash "true calamity upon us all", Geralt says he'll "take that chance", dooming Cintra.
Yennefer's timeline.
Yennefer is escorting Queen Kalis and her infant daughter across the countryside. Kalis laments that she has borne seven daughters, and her husband, the King, has all but given up hope that she can bear him a son; for all the prestige associated with being a queen, she is treated little better than a breeding horse. Yennefer admits that she gave up "everything" (i.e., her ability to conceive a child of her own, though she does not say this aloud to Kalis) to get what she thought she wanted - beauty and a prestigious position as a court mage - only to spend thirty years "putting out political fires".
Their conversation is interrupted by a mage assassin, who slaughters almost their entire retinue of guards with his Krallach. Yennefer teleports herself, Kalis, and their last guard away, but the assassin follows them through his own portal, killing the guard mid-chase. Yennefer realizes that the assassin has been hired by the King, seeking to remove Kalis and replace her with a woman who can bear him a son, and the King has likely given Kalis something that the assassin can use to track her. Yennefer teleports them through several more portals, as they remove and destroy Kalis's jewelry, trying to lose the tracker, but the assassin follows them each time. Growing angry and scared, Kalis blames Yennefer for failing to predict the attack, so Yennefer abandons Kalis to die.
Left alone on a random mountainside, Kalis pleads with the assassin that she can produce a male heir, and when he doesn't respond, she offers her own daughter as a "sacrifice" to him. Again he ignores her, and telekinetically launches a dagger that slices open her throat, killing her. His Krallach then prepares to kill her daughter, but Yennefer returns through another portal and kills it, wielding power against the assassin directly. When she realizes she cannot defeat him, she creates a portal and takes the baby through it, although not before the assassin lodges another knife in her back.
Arriving in a surf, she stumbles to shore only to find that the baby was killed as the dagger had pierced all the way through her shoulder. She tries to heal it, but fails. Dejected, Yennefer sits on the beach and says to the dead babe that it's better that she never grew old enough to realize how horrible life is for women. Yennefer then buries the child.
Ciri's timeline.
Ciri continues to be drawn into Brokilon forest, and by the time she shrugs off the compulsion she finds herself surrounded by hostile dryads. Eventually Eithné speaks to her, asking her name, and Ciri goes under the alias "Fiona". Ciri then goes with the dryads, and Eithné explains that there were once many such forests like Brokilon before the Conjunction of the Spheres, before humans and beasts arrived to destroy them.
They eventually find Dara, who is being painfully tended to by a dryad. Eithné then insists that they drink the waters of Brokilon, which supposedly kills those who have ill-intent toward Brokilon and makes those who are pure begin to forget the past. While they wait to drink, Dara gets Ciri to admit that she's the princess of Cintra, which angers Dara as Calanthe had ordered the slaughtering of his family.
That night Ciri has a dream of her mother's scream of denial from Geralt's timeline. She watches a battle ensue, and finds her own hands covered in blood before Cahir kills her. She then wakes up to find that Dara has already drunk the waters of Brokilon, and although she drinks it herself, nothing happens. Eithné then takes her to Shan-Kayan.
In Cintra, the Nilfgaardians have found Calanthe's corpse. One of Fringilla's servants eats a square of her flesh, and then Fringilla eviscerates him. Reading his entrails, she discovers that Ciri is in Brokilon Forest, and reports this to Cahir. Mousesack is then dragged along with Cahir, who knows that armies are not the way into Brokilon forest.
At the heart of Brokilon, Eithné cuts the bark of Shan-Kayan, causing sap to flow from it. She instructs Ciri to drink it, and when she does, she finds herself in the middle of a desert. At its center, she sees a massive tree, which asks her, "what are you, child?"

Bottled Appetites

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"Bottled Appetites" is the fifth episode of Netflix's "The Witcher" series and is based on the short story "The Last Wish".
"Heedless of warnings, Yennefer looks for a cure to restore what she's lost. Geralt inadvertently puts Jaskier in peril. The search for Ciri intensifies."
Summary.
Geralt's timeline.
Jaskier encounters Geralt of Rivia again after several years, a decade since the first meeting. He finds Geralt fishing in a lake just outside Rinde, so he launches into a story about how the Countess de Stael left him (again), and begs Geralt to spare some fish. However, Geralt isn't fishing; he's looking for a djinn so that he can wish for a cure to his insomnia.
Jaskier suggests that ignoring the Law of Surprise has caused his sleeplessness, but Geralt dismisses this and jokingly implies that Jaskier's singing is why the Countess left him again. He says that his singing is "like ordering a pie and finding it has no filling", and in response Jaskier grabs the djinn's bottle just as Geralt pulls it from the lake, saying he'd let go if Geralt takes back his insult. They wrestle over the bottle, and Geralt accidentally opens it.
As the sky begins to darken, Jaskier immediately makes two wishes and is stopped from making the third wish by Geralt. Geralt warns Jaskier about the third wish, saying he only wanted some "peace", so Jaskier angrily shatters the bottle. Jaskier then begins to cough, so Geralt drives away its amorphous form with a sign, restoring light to the sky. However, Jaskier now begins to cough up blood, forcing Geralt to take Jaskier to Chireadan for healing.
Chireadan tells Geralt that the wound is naturally magic, and if not dealt with soon could result in permanent damage to Jaskier's throat or even death. He gives Jaskier a liquid to buy him a few hours but insists that he get magical help immediately from another town. Geralt pressures him on whether a mage is present in Rinde, so he reveals that a malicious one has taken over the mayor's house.
Geralt heads that way but is halted outside the house by Beau Berrant's servant. He demands money to "open all doors", so Geralt knocks him out with his coin purse, "so it does". Geralt then hauls Jaskier inside the house in a fireman's carry, meeting a crazed Beau Berrant on the way. Geralt then makes his way through an orgy downstairs to meet Yennefer, tossing Jaskier onto a random woman's bosom while he talks with her.
Yennefer's timeline.
 Yennefer has been living off the grid, utilizing the services of non-Brotherhood mages to help her restore her fertility. One such mage, Hemet, offers to apprentice her, but she refuses and leaves for another town to make money, as he originally suggested. She opens a shop called "Correctives, quite effective, whatever the objective", selling remedies to the townspeople such as temporary cures for erectile dysfunction.
Eventually, Beau Berrant arrives to tax Yennefer, but she surrenders rather than pay any money. She quickly manages to take over the entire mayor's house, subsuming its residents into a massive orgy compelled by magic. Tissaia then arrives to visit Yennefer, telling her of King Virfuril's death and inviting her to return to Aretuza. She insists that the rogue mages Yennefer is enlisting cannot restore Yennefer's womb, but Yennefer sends her away. She then retires downstairs, where the orgy is underway until Geralt arrives before her with Jaskier.
Geralt and Yennefer's timeline.
Meeting for the first time, Geralt insists that Yennefer heal Jaskier from his djinn-inflicted wound. She says "ragamuffin" aloud, which immediately lifts the compulsion from the orgy, and everyone returns to their senses and leaves. Yennefer tends to Jaskier and puts him in a healing sleep, taking the time to have a bath with Geralt.
Geralt and Yennefer talk about how they were transformed as children; Geralt into a witcher, Yennefer into a beautiful woman. They both cut through each other's delusions, such as Geralt seeking a djinn to "cure insomnia" and Yennefer "serving" the town she had enchanted. Angered, Geralt claims that he'll leave as soon as his debt to her is paid for healing Jaskier, but to his surprise, she deems the conversation as payment enough. True to his word, he gets out of the bath and leaves immediately.
Checking in on Jaskier, Geralt notices a ritual Yennefer had built to capture the djinn. He strongly recommends against the attempt, but then stutters as she enters his mind, forces him to experience certain sensations, and then finally forces him to sleep. He awakens locked in a cell with Chireadan, who informs him that he went on a rampage through Rinde while "asleep", of which he has no memory. Chireadan attempted to stop him from attacking Rinde citizens, but they were both imprisoned together.
Beau Berrant's servant then arrives and tortures Geralt, eventually asking for his last words, to which Geralt says "I want you to burst, you son of a whore." The wind rustles, and then suddenly the man's head explodes; the djinn is bound to Geralt. At that moment, Yennefer is torturing Jaskier to make his final wish so that she can claim the djinn. When he does so, she uses a ritual to draw the djinn in, without any knowledge that it is still bound to Geralt.
Jaskier runs terrified out of the house and meets Geralt, who escaped from prison with his tormentor's key. Jaskier tells Geralt of how Yennefer was attempting to make herself the djinn's vessel, so Geralt rushes in to save her. He offers to give her his last wish if she just releases the djinn, but she hysterically insists that she do it herself, that he only permits her success "as long as you command it yourself". With no other option, Geralt makes his wish, and the djinn flees into another plane.
Yennefer awakens, enraged that Geralt set the djinn free. She warns of the havoc it'll cause now that it is entirely free, but Geralt insists that djinns are only malicious when bound; "when did you last feel happy when you felt trapped?" The two then have sex in the ruins of the mayor's house, even as Jaskier was preparing to compose a song to commemorate Geralt's death. Chireadan then notices them having sex, and reports this to Jaskier. Afterwards, Yennefer asks Geralt what he wished for, but he is finally sound asleep, his insomnia gone.
Ciri's timeline.
Cahir seeks out a doppler, unusual for his evil nature, and tasks him with transforming into Mousesack. Mousesack himself has been trapped in a cell made of dimeritium and is brought before Fringilla, who taunts his powerless state. Cahir then brings the doppler out and releases Mousesack, telling him to run, only for the doppler to tackle and transform into Mousesack. With his memories, the doppler reveals that Mousesack nearly killed himself to prevent the Nilfgaardians from using him, and Mousesack himself warns them that they don't understand what Ciri is, but the doppler kills Mousesack anyway. With him dead, Cahir orders the doppler to trick Ciri out of Brokilon Forest by pretending to be Mousesack.
In Brokilon, the General is suspicious of Ciri, after Shan-Kayan revealed her true identity as Princess Cirilla of Cintra to the dryads. Eithné argues to allow her to stay, and when several dryads arrive with the heads of Nilfgaardian scouts, she manages to convince the dryads that Ciri might be the key to holding the encroaching army at bay. Eithné then pronounces, in Common Speech so that Ciri can understand, that Ciri will be allowed to stay.
Sometime later, the doppler enters Brokilon Forest, claiming to come in peace to claim "the girl". Seeing this, the General allows him safe passage into Brokilon, where he finds Ciri learning to make arrows. Although Eithné objects to Mousesack taking her, the doppler claims to be attempting to honor the Law of Surprise by bringing Ciri to Geralt of Rivia. Ciri herself also desires to leave, so Eithné advises her to "always ask the right questions", and then sends her on her way with Dara and the doppler.

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"Rare Species" is the sixth episode of Netflix's "The Witcher" series and is based on the short story "The Bounds of Reason".
""A mysterious man tries to entice Geralt to join a hunt for a rampaging dragon, a quest that attracts a familiar face. Ciri questions who she can trust."
Summary.
Geralt and Yennefer's timeline.
Geralt has just finished slaying a basilisk when he arrives to find his hirers preparing to steal Roach and leave without paying. Fortunately, Borch Three Jackdaws, an elderly man, has his Zerrikanian servant, Téa, snap one hirer's neck. Intimidated, the last hirer then turns over the promised payment to Geralt and flees in terror. Borch then introduces himself to Geralt along with Téa and his second Zerrikanian servant, Véa, and invites Geralt and Jaskier along for a drink.
At a local tavern Borch orders a feast for Geralt and their companions. He explains to Geralt that a green dragon had been spotted in King Niedamir's mountains in Caingorn, and that although the locals attempted to attack the dragon in order to get its treasure, they only managed to wound it. In retaliation, the dragon laid waste to them and much of the countryside in return. With King Niedamir set to marry the princess of a rival kingdom, Malleore, he put a price on the dragon's head; the dragon's horde, plus the title of lord over one of his new vassal states.
Borch asks Geralt to join his team to hunt the dragon, and although Geralt is initially dead set against it, refusing to kill an intelligent creature such as a dragon, he suddenly changes his mind and agrees when he sees Yennefer on a rival team. Jaskier, who had been unsuccessfully propositioning the Zerrikanian women the entire time, then lobbies against joining the hunt, but Geralt has already made up his mind.
First day of the hunt.
Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Téa, and Véa form one team, while Yarpen Zigrin and his dwarves form a second, Boholt and his Crinfrid Reavers form a third, and finally, Yennefer and Sir Eyck of Denesle form a fourth. While the groups are en route to the dragon's lair, Jaskier asks the Zerrikanians why they serve Borch. Zerrikanians being dragon worshippers, Véa cryptically says that hunting with Borch is "an honor unsullied by payment", and Téa exasperatedly says that "he is the most beautiful", as if it was plainly obvious, which confuses Jaskier.
Jaskier later gets hungry and wonders off the path in search of food for himself and for the Zerrikanians. He stumbles upon a hirikka, which promptly rears up to its full height and scares Jaskier away. Geralt warns that the hirikka is only hungry, advising everyone to sheathe their weapons, but Eyck heedlessly rushes forward and dismembers the beast before ruthlessly chopping away at its decapitated corpse. Had they simply given it food, this endangered creature would've peacefully departed.
Eyck later cooks the hirikka, and once again ignores advice when Borch warns him not to eat it. After doing so, he is soon forced to leave with impending diarrhea. Yarpen mentions that the vassal state promised to the dragon killer won't exist for long due to Nilfgaard expanding in the south, and Yennefer leaves when Borch cryptically comments that Nilfgaard could have been tempered earlier by "stronger hand", referring to Yennefer's refusal to be assigned to Nilfgaard decades ago.
Jaskier then wonders if dragons really exist, amusing the rest of his hunting party. Geralt confirms that three dragon types exist, starting from most common: green, red, and black. Borch corrects him however, saying that there is an even rarer fourth dragon type, but Geralt dismisses this as mythical. He allows that such a dragon could exist due to an accidental, unique mutation, but insists that it's unlikely because mutations are usually artificial, and even if such an unlikely thing did occur, those dragons have surely been killed off by now.
Second day of the hunt.
The next morning it is discovered that Eyck had his throat cut while he was relieving himself. Disturbed by what they suspect to be the reavers' savagery, the dwarves form a temporary compact with Borch's group to use a secret dwarven shortcut through the mountains. Geralt catches up with Yennefer and invites her along as well, and when she reveals that she wants the dragon for its "healing properties", Geralt becomes bemused that she would travel "all this way for made-up fertility cures using fresh dragon hearts".
Geralt insists that he and Yennefer were made infertile because children aren't suited to their lifestyles, saying that he'd rather use his Child Surprise as "bruxa bait" than subject it to his lifestyle. Yennefer calls out his hypocrisy of having his own child while mocking her for wanting one, which frustrates Geralt, but he manages to convince her to come with him on the dwarven shortcut.
The shortcut turns out to be an incredibly narrow path of planks flimsily attached to the side of a sheer cliff face. Although the dwarves make quick time along it, one of the planks breaks beneath Borch's feet, leaving him and his Zerrikanian servants dangling from a chain. Supremely unconcerned, Borch lets go and falls into the mists below, with Téa and Véa following suite to fall after him. Geralt, Yennefer, and Jaskier then follow after the dwarves without Borch, and Geralt retires to Yennefer's tent to have sex.
Third day of the hunt.
It is revealed that ever since meeting Yennefer in Rinde, Geralt and Yennefer have stumbled into each other repeatedly on random occasions just like this, and every time they would have sex and Yennefer would leave him afterward. That morning, they both stayed together. This time, it's the dwarves who have left them, having abandoned them to go after the dragon alone.
Yennefer eventually catches up with the dwarves, shouting in Elder Speech to immobilize them with a spell. She then comes before the corpse of Myrgtabrakke, the green dragon they'd been hunting, who lies protectively around an egg. When Yennefer approaches, Téa and Véa suddenly arrive with swords drawn, warning Yennefer to stay back, and Geralt himself arrives shortly afterward, stunned to see them alive. After that Villentretenmerth, a golden dragon, arrives and announces himself as Borch Three Jackdaws.
Téa and Véa explain that Myrgtabrakke could not leave when the humans attacked her because moving her egg at that time would kill her offspring. Borch, being the father, arrived with his servants to sabotage King Niedamir's hunt. Their story is interrupted when Boholt arrives with his reavers, who immediately attack, forcing Geralt and Yennefer and Borch's servants to hold them at bay.
When the fighting gets difficult, Yennefer joins with Geralt to overpower his simple Sign-based magic, allowing him to cast Aard with such force that the entire band of reavers are launched bodily out of the dragon's cave. The Zerrikanians then split off to combat incoming reinforcements while Yennefer and Geralt attack the main body of reavers. Only a single reaver manages to get past the Zerrikanians, who Villentretenmerth easily dispatches with a stream of fire from his mouth.
Geralt and Yennefer get bogged down fighting the last two reavers, so Geralt throws his sword into the side of the second to last reaver, freeing Yennefer. Boholt, the very last, then takes the opportunity to throw dirt in Geralt's eyes, and bears down on him with his spear. Just before Boholt can kill Geralt however, Yennefer stabs him in the throat, killing him.
End of the hunt.
All the way back at camp, poor Jaskier has only just now woken up, seeing that both the dwarves and Geralt and Yennefer left him behind. He rushes to catch up, passing the now-partially mobile dwarves and arriving at the reavers' mound of corpses. There he finds Téa and Véa, who he is astonished to see still alive, and finally the dwarves manage to break free of the remnants of Yennefer's immobility spell to arrive as well.
Before a fight can break out between the dwarves and Zerrikanians, Villentretenmerth, again in his human form, arrives and offers Yarpen Zigrin some dragon teeth to take to King Niedamir. He assures them that Myrgtabrakke's corpse would be dropped on Niedamir's wedding if he doesn't accept the teeth as proof.
After the dwarves leave, Villentretenmerth speaks with Geralt and Yennefer, thanking them for protecting his child. In the process, he reveals that Geralt used his wish to ensure that he would never lose Yennefer, forcing them to always find each other again. Yennefer angrily accuses Geralt of taking her freedom, to which he retorts that the wish saved her life, and that she "flit[s] about like a tornado" just because she wants a baby "to boost [her] fragile ego". Enraged, she says she won't take advice from him regarding children until he takes responsibility "for the one you bound to you and then abandoned".
Villentretenmerth then cuts through the argument to "save you both a lot of hurt with a little pain now". He reveals that Yennefer cannot regain her fertility, and that despite Geralt's wish being honored by the djinn, he will eventually lose Yennefer. In an attempt to preempt this, Yennefer leaves. Villentretenmerth also leaves, telling Geralt that his destiny is still out there. Jaskier tries to comfort Geralt, but Geralt lashes out at him in a rage, blaming him for the party where Geralt became bound by the Law of Surprise, the situation with the djinn, and now his loss of Yennefer. Geralt laments that if life could give him one blessing, "it would be to take you off my hands". Hurt, Jaskier leaves Geralt alone.
Ciri's timeline.
As Ciri, Dara, and the doppler (in the guise of Mousesack) make their way out of Brokilon Forest, Ciri keeps up a nonstop stream of questions about Geralt. This aggravates the doppler, who eventually insists she stop asking. Dara becomes suspicious however, and questions why Mousesack "abandoned" Ciri. The doppler claims to have been pulled through a portal by Nilfgaard. He claims to have escaped via Geralt's help and was then sent by him to get Ciri, but when Dara questions why Geralt would not come for Ciri himself, the doppler dodges and insists on Dara asking Geralt himself.
His suspicions rising, Dara urges Ciri to follow Eithné's advice to "ask the right questions". Hearing this, the doppler pulls out Calanthe's sash and gives it to Ciri, distracting her with the gift. However, she still asks Mousesack if he misses the cold, to which he annoyedly confirms, so Ciri realizes that he has been lying because the real Mousesack has arthritis and hates the cold.
Found out, the doppler tries to drag Ciri along, revealing that they killed Mousesack and took his form. Dara then attacks them, forcing the doppler to disarm him, screaming in pain as they touch Dara's silver weapon. Ciri then grabs it and presses it against their neck, singeing the doppler's flesh and driving them back. Dara manages to hold the doppler down with the silver knife and begins to ask them questions, but Ciri insists that the doppler came for her because she's "special" and urges Dara to simply kill them. Bewildered, Dara hesitates, only for Ciri to grab his silver knife to kill the doppler herself. In the confusion, the doppler manages to knock Dara out and disarm Ciri, forcing her to flee.
She ends up getting captured by the doppler, now in the form of Cahir. Rather than take her to the real Cahir as promised, they instead tie Ciri to a tree and present themselves to Cahir in the form of Ciri. Cahir reveals that he is actually just trying to help Ciri fulfill her "destiny", but when he goes to get her some food, he turns around to see himself standing before him; it's the doppler, having taken on Cahir's own form. The doppler says that Cahir "lied to us", and didn't tell them "what she is, what she's capable of". They then attack each other, the doppler taunting Cahir all the while: "Do you really believe all this nonsense in your head? This prophecy? We think you're insane!" Eventually Cahir forces the doppler to flee, slicing a jagged cut along their face and ending the fight.
Ciri, still tied to a tree, is eventually freed by Dara, who the doppler didn't bother to kill. Dara berates her for leaving the safety of Brokilon, and accuses her of bringing "terror" and "death" wherever she goes, just like Calanthe, but Ciri says she's "done apologizing". She insists on continuing onward, but Dara tells her to "find a new family, because I can't be there for you anymore." He then abandons her.
Meanwhile, Cahir is recovering from his fight with the doppler, having failed to hunt him down. Fringilla tends to his wounds and assures him that they will find Ciri, and expand Nilfgaard throughout the Continent.

Before a Fall

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"Before a Fall" is the seventh episode of Netflix's "The Witcher" series and is based on the short story "The Sword of Destiny".
"With the Continent at risk from Nilfgaard's rising power, Yennefer revisits her past, while Geralt reconsiders his obligation to the Law of Surprise."
Summary.
Geralt's timeline.
Out near the Amell Pass, Geralt sees the Nilfgaardian Army marching, and correctly deduces they're heading for Cintra and hastily makes his way there and meets Mousesack to inquire if his Child of Surprise is safe. Mousesack then reveals the Child of Surprise is a girl named Cirilla, having been raised by Calanthe after Pavetta and Duny died at sea years ago. After Geralt remarks on what he saw at the Amell Pass, Mousesack tries to tell Geralt they're well prepared but is cut off when Geralt hears people moving in the underground tunnels, and the witcher almost rhetorically asks if the queen also sent assassins. He then investigates the tunnels where two of the assassins briefly show themselves before disappearing. Having his answer, Geralt takes Mousesack as a hostage and shield, forcing all eight assassins to come out in the open. As the assassins close in on the pair, and not wishing to die in the crossfire, Mousesack casts a portal to teleport him, and therefore Geralt, to safety.
Meanhile, Calanthe and Danek are inspecting the Cintran Army's equipment as they discuss Nilfgaard, believing they won't dare attack Cintra but to prepare themselves as always. Eist is also expected to return that same day from his trip to Skellige, with 50 of the country's ships in tow to aid in their fight. Right after, a teleported Mousesack and Geralt approach, and an incensed Calanthe notes she warned Geralt not to come back as her guards draw their swords. Geralt informs her he hadn't planned to until she sent the assassins. The two then have a heated discussion, where it becomes clear Calanthe is trying to protect her only surviving relative, having already lost Pavetta, though Geralt promises he'll take Ciri and protect her, then bring her back once the Nilfgaardian threat is over. Coming to terms with this, Calanthe announces the Law of Surprise has been called and that she'll tell Ciri herself.
A short time later, Geralt enters the castle where he's given an audience once more with Calanthe, who's in the process of telling a crying Ciri that Geralt is meant to take her away as Mousesack looks on. Geralt greets Ciri but she remains silent to him, turning instead to the queen to ask if she can say goodbye to her friends and her grandmother agrees before the young princess heads off. Calanthe then tells Geralt she'll summon him once Ciri has said her goodbyes and is ready to leave.
With that, Geralt leaves the room and heads down the hall but appears to be magically drawn towards the underground tunnels, which he proceeds to follow all the way to the end before exiting out a side door, just in time to see Ciri running over to a group of children playing knucklebones and saying goodbye to them. However, as she finishes, she bows towards the last one and calls them "Your Highness", revealing the one Geralt met was merely a decoy and the real princess was the one dressed up as a peasant outside.
Angry at this deception, Geralt confronts the queen and tries to convince her he's only trying to protect Ciri, to which Calanthe retorts the last time she listened to him, she let a hedgehog into her court which led to Pavetta dying at sea as a result, and Ciri is safe as they have an army and navy to defend against Nilfgaard. No matter what Geralt says though, Calanthe won't change her mind and Eist, having returned from his trip, appears just in time for his wife to tell him to get Geralt out of her sight.
Eist then leads Geralt out of the castle and to the nearby gate as Geralt questions him on why he no longer honors the Law of Surprise. Eist merely responds having a granddaughter changed that and reveals that Calanthe was extremely grief stricken after the initial loss of her daughter, but having pulled herself through that, he's confident in his wife's decisions to their final days. After Geralt notes he can't promise he won't try to come back if he believes Ciri's ever in danger, Eist has the witcher trapped between the 2 metal gates in the archway.
A few days later, Cintra is now being razed by Nilfgaard while an unarmed Geralt is meditating in a cell. On hearing the chaos, Geralt manages to grab a passing knight, knock him out, and grab the cell keys off him, before rearming himself and making his way out of the castle. However, he immediately comes under attack from Nilfgaardian soldiers but quickly takes them out and watches from behind a wagon as more soldiers storm the keep. As he continues to watch, a sudden thud is heard and when he looks around the wagon, he sees a now dead Calanthe. At this, Geralt storms back into the castle to find Ciri, killing every Nilfgaardian soldier he comes across as he goes.
Yennefer's timeline.
In Nazair, Yennefer visits an archaeological dig site and is immediately asked by two Nilfgaardian officers if she has a safe conduct letter to visit, which she hands over and answers their questions regarding her visit. Satisfied, the officers head off just in time for Istredd and Yennefer to spot each other, with the former greeting the sorceress. Istredd then shows Yennefer around as he talks about his work there: excavating a magnalith that was inaccessible until Nilfgaard took Nazair by force. However, Istredd notes he doesn't care how it's done, only that he can do his research, particularly regarding a prophecy and the future.
As the two sit together at a makeshift tavern, Yennefer then reveals she'd like to rekindle their relationship, including the "boring" life Istredd offered back at Aretuza that she'd originally rejected. When Istredd questions why him when she could have anyone, she reveals she has had others, but all they saw in her was her power in court as a king's mage, rather than her own magical powers. The two kiss but Istredd then breaks it off, revealing he'd spent years wishing for them to be back together, including ways to study in Aedirn when Yennefer was there to try and get closer to her, but Yennefer at the time shut down all his requests. Eventually, Stregobor convinced Istredd to focus on work instead and over time Istredd came to terms with not being with Yennefer anymore as they wanted separate things in life. He then gets up and leaves Yennefer alone at the table.
However, no sooner did he leave than another man, Vilgefortz, immediately took the vacant seat. Mistaking him as someone trying to pick her up, Yennefer told him to leave her alone but Vilgefortz noted he didn't have much time to talk, revealing Nilfgaard was conscripting mages into their service and, as both of them were there illegally with no legit safe conduct letters, they needed to get to Aretuza. As Yennefer laughed at the idea, Vilgefortz remarked while the Chapter saw her as "rash, unpredictable and dangerous" it was what Tissaia de Vries and Vilgefortz needed and Tissaia had even told Vilgefortz that Yennefer was "the best student she ever taught."
Back at Aretuza, Yennefer meets Vilgefortz along with two other mages, but notably Tissaia isn't present. Vilgefortz then brings up Nilfgaard and how they believe Nilfgaard's going to attack Cintra, but Yennefer quickly dismisses this, noting she doesn't care about that and asks where Tissaia is. Vilgefortz tries to tell her the rectress can wait but, unperturbed, Yennefer sets out to find her only for Vilgefortz to inform her Tissaia actually doesn't know she's there. Angry at being misled, Yennefer sets off through the school, only to storm into her old room, surprising the three students inside. After waylaying her sudden appearance, she takes the girls to the greenhouse to learn other uses for the herbs they're studying that aren't taught in school, noting to the trio to think for themselves before having them experience hallucinations from the mixed herbs. During this hallucination, the girls reveal the Chapter felt they needed students from the "best" families, allowing parents to buy their daughter's way in, even if they never had a Conduit moment.
As the girls show hesitation at what they're learning with the herbs, fearing expulsion, Yennefer notes there's far worse things and takes them to the underground water pool below Aretuza. As one girl asks to know more, Yennefer reveals that they're sterilized and therefore can't have families, ensuring loyalty only to the Chapter, and all for a disappointing life. As another girl more firmly notes they shouldn't be there and that they won't mess up like Yennefer did, Yennefer then reveals what happens to those who don't ascend, showing the eels in the water. Just as she does, Tissaia interrupts and sends the girls away.
Yennefer then confronts Tissaia but they see groups of mages urgently heading off somewhere and Tissaia quickly follows. Yennefer spots another face in the group, Triss, and calls out to her, who reveals it's an emergency conclave as Nilfgaard is attacking Cintra.
In the meeting room, there's a clear divide even among the Northern mages: Stregobor and Artorius are ok with Cintra falling, while Vilgefortz and Tissaia wish to save it, noting if Cintra falls, Nilfgaard will continue after the rest and is a threat to their way of life and magical practices. As they argue, suddenly the meeting is interrupted by none other than Fringilla, who helps the Nilfgaardian emperor. As Triss points out all the wrongdoing Nilfgaard and its mages do, such as conscripting mages and practicing forbidden magic like necromancy, Fringilla waylays these concerns before issuing a warning: if the mages there won't pick sides, then they should at least stay out of Nilfgaard's way as they only wish to take Cintra. The conversation then turns to Stregobor and Artorius making jabs at Yennefer for what she did years ago before the conclave calls a vote, resulting in the majority of the mages in favor of letting Cintra fall.
After the meeting, Yennefer and Tissaia talk in private and the rectress reveals a small group of mages that wish to stop Nilfgaard from encroaching any further north are planning to fight at another spot that Nilfgaard is sure to try and attack. Yennefer still shows scorn, not caring for the school and its recent practices, but Tissaia asks if she won't fight for the brotherhood, to at least do it for her.
Ciri's timeline.
Now alone, Ciri makes her way through a village where she poorly attempts to steal food as she tries to make her way to Skellige. Overhearing this, a nearby woman, Zola, warns Ciri to be careful as it's not safe traveling through the area alone, but Ciri rebuffs this as she's become accustomed to it by this point and walks off.
As she passes a group of people watching a puppet skit being put on, she spots some gloves but before she can run off with them, the seller calls to her and she hands over an expensive ring that once belonged to her mother as payment. She then discards the worn out single glove she had and puts on the new ones as Zola approaches her, trying to talk her out of going to Skellige as the roads aren't safe while Ciri tries to walk off from her again. Unperturbed, Zola gets in front of Ciri to stop her and notes she just needs to finish one more errand and make room on her horses, Clip and Clop, but could offer Ciri food and a safe place to stay at her home. Ciri silently nods in agreement, but as soon as Zola heads off to finish her tasks, Ciri steals one of the horses and takes off.
Now night time, Ciri's set up a small campfire out in a field with the stolen horse nearby when she hears the sudden approach of people. Initially wary, Ciri grabs a branch to defend herself but recognizes one of the four men as Anton, one of the kids she played knucklebones with. She runs forward, happy to see him, but he rudely pushes her aside as he notes to another he knew it was her at the market before they run over to the horse and start to pilfer the bags. As Ciri tries to tell them to stop, another pushes her back, noting Nilfgaard has a nice reward for her. She then tries to plead to Anton, who reveals he never liked her, only playing and letting her win because he had to all because she was a princess. As the group then proceed to pull her to the center of the clearing, Ciri releases another magical pulse, this time with another voice speaking through her of a prophecy before a scream is heard.

Much More

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"Much More" is the eighth and final episode of season 1 of Netflix's "The Witcher" series and is based on the short story "Something More".
"A terrifying pack of foes lays Geralt low. Yennefer and her fellow mages prepare to fight back. A shaken Ciri depends on the kindness of a stranger."
Summary.
Geralt's timeline.
"Look at these people. Innocent people, killed for what? So Nilfgaard can have more land? We owe it to 'em to do better."- Yurga to Geralt,  "Before a Fall"
Geralt examines Ciri's room in the castle, remembering how he promised to find and protect her. He then leaves the destroyed city and makes his way through the forests, eventually coming across the encampment Ciri had briefly found before Nilfgaardian soldiers attacked it a week ago. There, a lone man, Yurga, is hopelessly trying to give all the deceased a proper burial after coming across them on his way home, but Geralt warns him he needs to leave quickly as possible as the rotting bodies have likely attracted necrophages. Yurga is still intent on helping though and asks Geralt to assist, but Geralt rides off to head back to Kaer Morhen.
As Yurga continues to drag the bodies into lines, necrophages suddenly appear out of the ground behind him and proceed to grab and drag him down but Geralt intervenes, killing the monsters. The witcher then tells Yurga once more to go home, but even despite the attack, Yurga still insists he can help the deceased but finally relents when Geralt demands that he leave. Geralt then strolls into the center of the camp, not waiting long before groups of necrophages start to attack and the witcher proceeds to kill them all off, but not before one bit him on his thigh, a certain death if not treated soon. Before he can get far, Geralt then collapses there in the camp from the wound.
The next day, a barely conscious Geralt is riding in the back of Yurga's wagon, who came back for the witcher after he fell. As he rides through Sodden to bring Geralt to his home, Yurga notes the heavy mist they're riding through isn't natural as Geralt shifts back and forth through hallucinations, at one point remembering his childhood with his mother, Visenna, and Villentretenmerth's remarks. The delirious witcher tries to sit up on the wagon but Yurga manages to stop him as they hear explosions going off in the distance, and Yurga correctly deduces it means Nilfgaard has made it to Sodden.
A bit more conscious, Geralt gets a potion out of his bags and drinks some and pours the rest on the bite, but notes he needs to get to the other side of the Blue Mountains where someone can heal him, but this is all the way on the other side of Sodden. He then has more flashback visions, this time as his mother drives a wagon before stopping and sending the young Geralt off to get some water for her. On returning to the road though, his mother and the wagon are gone and as he calls for her, another voice, Vesemir, notes he's been waiting for Geralt.
Now nighttime, Geralt wakes up to a woman healing him, who he originally hallucinates as Renfri then Yennefer before finally seeing the real sorceress, who's none other than Visenna and happened to be traveling through the area when she heard Yurga's call for help. The two go back and forth, dancing around what they really want to say, before Geralt finally confronts her, wanting to know if she at least knew or not that he could have died during the Trial of the Grasses. Instead of giving him an answer, Visenna tells him he needs to move on before making him fall asleep.
Geralt then wakes up to find her gone but Yurga's still there and quickly loads back into his wagon as Yurga notes he doesn't have anything to really offer the witcher for saving his life earlier, so offers the Law of Surprise, though Geralt tells him just an ale would suffice. In another dream like state, Geralt, now envisioning himself at the battle of Sodden Hill, tries to call out for Yennefer just after she set the forest on fire but can't find her.
By the next morning, Yurga finally arrives back home with Geralt, and sees that his wife, Zola, and the farm are all safe and sound. Geralt then overhears Zola tell Yurga she met a girl in the forest nearby, and the witcher remembers Renfri's prophetic words to him and he sets off, almost in a trance, into the woods. As he looks around, he turns to see Ciri running to him through the trees and the two embrace as he remarks on destiny before Ciri looks up at him and asks "Who is Yennefer?".
Yennefer's timeline.
Deciding to help defend the North for Tissaia's sake, Yennefer and a number of other willing mages are sailing through the waters as Vilgefortz informs them they're headed for a keep on Sodden Hill, the only location that Nilfgaard will try to push through to continue further north. They've also gotten word Nilfgaard's army will likely arrive in two days time, as well as Temerian and Kaedwenian forces who got word from the mages and wish to help defend their lands from Nilfgaard.
On arriving at the keep, the mages quickly learn they won't just be trying to fortify the place, but also trying to protect all the refugees holed up there, as the owner of the keep believes they can still save it, with the mages' help. With that, the mages get to work, preparing and enchanting bottles with blue minerals, setting up arrows, and getting everyone inside the walls. As night falls, many of the people are getting in one last celebration before Nilfgaard arrives, but Yennefer finds a woman still working on setting things up, revealing she can't celebrate as she's already lost everything to Nilfgaard and therefore has no option but to fight back now. Yennefer then magically forms more feathers out of the single one left for the woman to use for fletching.
Yennefer then makes her way through the courtyard where Triss joins her and their conversation turns to Foltest, his daughter Adda's curse that was lifted, which then brings up Geralt, though Yennefer doesn't acknowledge she ever met him, only that his kind leads to disappointment. She then joins Tissaia and after some light teasing, Tissaia then asks Yennefer if she's ready to die who notes she is and that life has nothing else to give, but the rectress corrects her, noting the former pupil still has so much more left to give.
Several miles away, Cahir is adamant they have to push through Sodden Hill and could take Temeria without the extra men from Cintra as Fringilla walks in, informing them the Brotherhood is at Sodden Hill and therefore they must move now to try and take the keep, despite not knowing what type of magic they'll be facing. Getting reports that Ciri is likely already on the other side of the Yaruga, Cahir decides to move forward and have Fringilla test the Brotherhood's defenses.
Back at the keep, Yennefer and the rest have fallen asleep but Yennefer wakes up just in time to see a fireball coming right at them and manages to barely deflect it from hitting them. She then alerts everyone to get up and that Nilfgaard has started to attack. Meanwhile at the Nilfgaardian camp nearby, Fringilla then orders another fireball be thrown, resulting in another mage sacrificing their life to fuel one that's then catapulted once more at the keep and, once again, is deflected. At this, Fringilla then creates two objects in her hands: a small silver box and a small bag, handing off the box to another mage and orders him to draw the mages out while she pockets the bag.
At daybreak, the mages prepare for battle, though now there's only 22 of them, as many of the others fled after last night's attack. As they look out towards where the Nilfgaardian camp is, suddenly a dense fog starts to spread through the forest from the camp and heads straight for the keep, being caused by the male mage Fringilla gave the box to. Tissaia begins to order the mages to certain positions and sends Yennefer up to the tower to get an overview of the battlefield and to help direct the mages on their attacks, wanting Yennefer to reserve her magic.
From her perch, Yennefer sees a group of soldiers closing in and directs Tissaia, who gets Triss in position to cause mushrooms where the soldiers are marching to burst, releasing a fatal cloud of gas and killing the group off. Looking in another direction, Yennefer then directs Coral as more soldiers move on her position and stops them in their tracks as well. She then orders Sabrina and her group of archers to prepare their shots, and when told to fire, they release the glass bottles filled with the blue minerals before firing arrows to break them, raining explosions down on the Nilfgaardian troops below.
In another location, Yennefer lets Vilgefortz know it's time to strike and he teleports in and quickly takes out the few soldiers there, but Cahir dodges the mage's thrown sword as he draws his own blade while Vilgefortz uses his magic to have his sword re-appear in its sheathe to arm himself again. As the two square off, Cahir manages to make the mage lose his weapon again, who once more uses magic to make it appear at his side. Yennefer tries to tell Vilgefortz to slow down and reserve his magic, but he ignores this and repeatedly uses his magic to make his sword re-appear each time Cahir makes him lose it. However, Vilgefortz soon runs out of magic, leaving him defenseless, and Cahir kicks him down a hill where he crashes against several trees before getting knocked out.
In another section of the forest, Fringilla and a small group of Nilfgaardian archers prepare themselves, and the sorceress manages to use her magic to break open the barred keeps' gate before creating a portal in the forest which the archers then shoot into, just as the other end of the portal opens up in the keep's courtyard, sending the arrows through and wounding and killing several people there. The male mage with the box, near death himself, stumbles in through the destroyed gate, dying just as he drops the silver box.
Tissaia then finds Fringilla alone and tries to get her to see reason and stop the fighting, but Fringilla merely notes she's the reason the Skelligen ships didn't arrive to help Cintra, having caused a dense fog that sunk them all. She then throws the contents from the small bag at Tissaia, revealing it's dimeritium, and thus prevents the rectress from using magic, before Fringilla walks off. Back at the keep, the silver box then opens, releasing worm-like parasites.
With Nilfgaard closing in, Yennefer calls for all the mages to return to the keep, but several of them, like Coral and Atlan, are killed by the advancing soldiers, while Triss manages to create a living, vine-like barrier at the gate to hold them off for a time. However, the barrier is then attacked by a soldier with a torch, who manages to badly burn the sorceress. Inside the courtyard, Sabrina appears to act oddly and grabs two of the bottles with minerals before handing them off to two nearby children, and with merely a nod, the three appear to move to set destinations, with the two boys going to areas above where all the other bottles are while Sabrina makes her way up the tower to Yennefer and suddenly stabs her. Surprised at this, Yennefer sees a parasite coming out of Sabrina's ear just as the two boys, also with parasites, drop their bottles, causing massive explosions and casualties as they hit the rest of the bottles. Yennefer and Sabrina are thrown from the tower as a result, but Sabrina isn't able to protect herself and crashes into the ground. As Yennefer checks on her, Sabrina, now free from the parasite, apologizes for what happened.
Yennefer then heads off to try and find Tissaia, passing the carnage and dead mages as Fringilla telepathically notes Nilfgaard is the answer and could give Yennefer what she wants, a legacy by unlocking her potential, but Yennefer continues to try and find the rectress. Out in the forest, Vilgefortz comes to and finds a group of Nilfgaardians dead, having been killed by a wounded mage nearby. As the mage asks for help, Vilgefortz instead kills him and when Yennefer calls out if Vilgefortz is still alive, he ignores her.
With night falling, the injured Tissaia comes to while Nilfgaard continues to try and attack the remaining mages and Yennefer soon finds the still badly injured rectress, who informs her former pupil it's her turn to save everyone and the Continent, telling her to forget the lightning bottle and let her chaos explode. Yennefer then turns her gaze on the burning keep and absorbs all the fire, snuffing it out, before turning and releasing it on the hillside, setting the whole forest on fire and killing all the Nilfgaardian soldiers in its path, but disappears after she's done. As Tissaia hopelessly calls out for Yennefer, King Foltest arrives with his army to meet the Nilfgaardians.
Ciri's timeline.
Ciri wakes up in the field as Zola appears over her and gets her to sit up, though as Ciri looks around, she notices not only is the field's grass somehow mowed down, but the bodies of the four men and the horse are all dead, appearing to have been thrown and subsequently impaled by various trees nearby. As Zola asks what happened, Ciri responds that they came for her, to which Zola notes they got what they deserved then before taking Ciri back to her place.
Now nightfall, Zola's son, Nadbor, tries to get Ciri to talk as she quietly watches him groom a horse, going as far as questioning if she's dumb when his mother hears this and slaps him upside the head, remarking Ciri's been through hell and likely not ready to talk much right now. Right after, they hear rumbling and look outside to see a fireball flying through the night sky for a target in the distance and realize Nilfgaard is attacking Sodden.
As Ciri lays awake in bed, Zola tries to comfort Ciri as they hear the battle raging on in the distance, noting Nilfgaard has no reason to attack them as they're out of the way, but if the worst comes to pass, Zola remarks she's at peace with herself, having everything she had ever wanted: a husband, son, a roof over her head, and now a daughter in Ciri.
The next morning Ciri snaps out of her sleep, having been woken up by hearing Geralt's dream where he was calling for Yennefer, and remembers her grandmother telling her to find Geralt of Rivia. With that, she leaves Zola's home and sets off into the nearby forest. At one point she begins to run, sensing Geralt, and finds him a short time later and the two hug each other, while Geralt remarks on destiny. Looking up at him, Ciri then asks him "Who is Yennefer?".

Elephants are gigantic creatures who inhabit the warmer parts of the Continent. They are characterized by tusks and enormous trunks (elongated noses) that can catch things and manipulate the environment.
Apart from the common Far South elephant, there are other related trunked mammals living in different areas of the world and hunted for ivory. In Zerrikania, a species of elephants is rumored to be prey of giant spiders. Mastodons are hairy animals known to Nordlings because of their size that roam forested areas, while mammoths are covered in thick fur and adopted to Far North tundra climate.
Elephants in culture.
Elephant tusks are the source of ivory, a highly valued hard material.
Elephants can be tamed and used by armies. A number of these animals were shipped from Ofir to Northern Realms by mercenaries after Dulla kh'Amanni's expedition.

The Van Moorlehem was apparently an ordinary aristocratic Nilfgaardian family who enjoyed hunting and masquerade balls. However, when guests started disappearing during these balls, people soon stopped visting the family's palace; even poachers preferred to move their hunting spots away from the woods surrounding the Van Moorlehem's lands.
Actually, people's fear was extremely justified, since the Moorlehems used to hide a dreadful secret: every family member was secretly a vampire.

Immortals

The Immortals were an elite armored unit within the Ofiri army. Their name was due to the fact that, whenever a soldier was killed off or seriously injured, he was immediately replaced by a new one, thus keeping the unit always full and strong. This immediate compensation for the injured and dead, combined with their near-impenetrable shield formations, made the Immortals a famously lethal force.
The Immortals cavalry, unlike regular mounted units, rode camels instead of horses, due to their better suitability to the desert. Their war chariots, complimented with three blades protruding from the wheels, easily sliced up the Ofiri's mounted enemies. However, the most fearsome combat asset of the Immortals was the war elephant, with their thick, leather skin that was often additionally armored, combined with saddle-platforms donned with archers shooting down hellfire. The soldiers equipment usually consisted of Ofiri armor, sabers, spears, shields, and bows.
During the Third Northern War, a conspicuous number of Immortals, as well as war elephants, were sold to the Northern Kingdoms in order to fight against Nilfgaard.

Geralt of Rivia (b. 1160) was a witcher, who was tied to Ciri through the Law of Surprise. While initially reluctant to accept his destiny, Geralt eventually came to terms with his fate. Despite their tumultuous relationship, he also loved the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg.
Biography.
Early Life.
Geralt was born in 1160. He is the son of the sorceress Visenna, who raised him during the first years of his life. She abandoned him in the mountains of Kaedwen when he was a small child, was picked up by the witcher Vesemir, who took him to the fortress of Kaer Morhen and trained him to become a witcher. During his training, he became friends with the other apprentices Eskel, Lambert and Remus. He survived the herbal test and became a witcher, a mutant, with supernatural senses, but with a side effect, turning his hair color white.
Meeting Princess Renfri.
In 1231, Geralt of Rivia, a well-known witcher, goes into Blaviken in search of an alderman after killing a kikimora in the nearby swamp. It's there that he meets a woman named Renfri in a tavern. She greets him with beer rather than hateful looks. He eventually makes the acquaintance of Marilka, the daughter of the alderman, and she directs him to a sorcerer named Stregobor, who took up the name Master Irion from the long since deceased creator of the tower he inhabits. He lured Geralt into town to hire him to assassinate Renfri. Stregobor explains his reasoning behind wanting to kill Renfri. The Curse of the Black Sun, a solar eclipse that marked the imminent return of Lilit — demon goddess of the night — whose sole purpose was to exterminate the human race. Lilit's path was to be prepared by 60 women wearing gold crowns, who would fill the river valleys with blood. Stregobor studied the girls born around the Black Sun, and he found internal mutations among them. He tried to cure them, locking them in towers for safekeeping, but each girl died. He believes eliminating them was the lesser evil. Renfri, princess of Creyden and daughter of Fredefalk, is after Stregobor. He personally delivered Renfri in the middle of the afternoon, under the Black Sun and knows for certain that she's the bringer of evil. In fear of Lilit's return, Stregobor dispatched someone to follow Renfri into the woods. They later found him in the brush with Renfri's broach jammed in his ear. She disappeared shortly thereafter and wouldn't reappear for another two years. Stregobor would stop her himself except for the fact that she's resistant to magic given her mutation. She chased Stregobor for years, plotting her revenge, and now she's tracked him to Blaviken. Despite Stregobor's offer, Geralt only kills monsters.
Renfri, the woman from the tavern, tracks Geralt down outside Blaviken and demands to know where to find Stregobor so that she may kill him for the injustices she suffered, claiming that Stregobor's man raped her and robbed her before letting her go. However, Geralt insists that should Renfri kill Stregobor, she would only be confirming Stregobor's accusations of her being a monster. Geralt advises Renfri to leave Blaviken and Stregobor behind.
Renfri follows Geralt back to his camp, where he recounts his first monster kill with Roach, his horse. That was the day he realized the world didn't need him and that he would only ever be seen as a monster. Renfri questions what Geralt believes in, as it is neither destiny nor the lesser evil. Geralt simply kills monsters. There are no sides. Renfri has decided to leave Blaviken for good tomorrow. They kiss and then have sex.
While dreaming of his night with Renfri, Geralt hears her tell him of his future, how he would be ran out of Blaviken with thrown stones and that the "girl in the woods" is his destiny, one which he cannot escape. Geralt awakens alone in the woods of Blaviken. Realizing that Renfri intends to slaughter her way through Blaviken until she finds Stregobor, he goes into town to stop her, where he is met by her soldiers, who he dispatches with ease. He then finds Renfri holding a blade to Marilka's throat, and she threatens to kill everyone in Blaviken until Stregobor comes down to face her. Geralt warns her to leave Blaviken, displaying magic as a means to threaten. However, magic has no effect on Renfri, only silver, as with monsters. Renfri releases Marilka and attacks Geralt. She manages to cut him several times before Geralt disarms her, leaving her with only a dagger to combat him. Geralt lowers his sword, presenting her with an opportunity to attack, however, he evades her attack and stabs her in the throat with her own dagger. As Renfri bleeds out in Geralt's arms, she reminds him of his destiny and that the "girl in the woods" will be with him always.
Stregobor comes down to see the destruction left in Renfri's wake. He orders Marilka to bring him a cart so that they can take her back to the tower for an autopsy. When Geralt objects, Stregobor informs him that it was Renfri's mutation that allowed her to influence her followers. When Geralt refuses to lower his sword, Stregobor realizes that he must've been similarly influenced and directs attention to the men Geralt had killed. This causes the townspeople, Marilka included, to revolt against Geralt. They throw stones at him, as Renfri predicted they would, until he is forced to leave her body behind.
An Encounter with Elves.
In 1240, nine years after his massacre at Blaviken, while drinking at a tavern, Geralt is approached by a bard named Jaskier, who insists that Geralt review his performance. Geralt tells Jaskier that the creatures in his song don't exist, and Jaskier realizes that he's a witcher, which he announces to the bar. A patron named Nettly overhears and offers to pay Geralt 100 ducats if he kills the "devil" that's been stealing their grain. Geralt agrees to the job, but only for 150 pay. Jaskier decides to tag along, during which time he offers to help improve Geralt's image so that he's no longer seen as a monstrous killer.
While hunting for this "devil", Geralt is attacked by a Sylvan named Torque. It charges at Geralt, knocking him to the ground. Geralt gets back to his feet and grabs it by the horns and slams it to the ground. To his surprise, it can talk. Rather than killing Torque, Geralt shows mercy, allowing him to live so long as he leaves the mountains. However, someone sneaks up behind Geralt and knocks him out.
Geralt wakes up in a cave, tied up back-to-back with Jaskier and surrounded by elves. Geralt and Jaskier are repeatedly hit by a sickly elf named Toruviel. Geralt waits until she gets close enough to headbutt her. They are joined by Torque and king of elves, Filavandrel. Torque has been stealing goods for them ever since they were forced out of Dol Blathanna. This comes as a surprise to Jaskier, who has been under the impression that the elves willingly left to return to their golden palaces when in reality they retreated to simple caves. Unfortunately, he can't allow Geralt and Jaskier to leave in fear that Posada will learn that they've been stealing, giving the humans a reason to attack, which will undoubtedly result in casualties on both sides. Hoping to avoid war, Filavandrel must kill them. Filavandrel's elders worked with humans and got robbed of all they had. And when they fought back, they were slaughtered in a battle that would come to be known as the "Great Cleansing". Bringing his people down from the mountains would mean bowing down to the humans, who would make them slaves. Geralt advises them to rebuild elsewhere. Filavandrel has a change of heart and decides to let Geralt and Jaskier go.
Geralt and Jaskier leave the mountains, having been released. In return, Geralt gave them the 150 ducats he was paid to kill Torque. In this adventure, Jaskier has gained a newfound respect for Filavandrel. They survived the Great Cleansing once. Maybe they can do it again. Jaskier starts to sing a tune while Geralt follows alongside.
Hunt for the Striga.
Three years later, Geralt has just finished having sex with a prostitute, who has heard his tales from Jaskier and associate each scar with a different conquest. She informs him that another witcher by the name of Remus passed through last month on his way to Temeria, which is plagued by some kind of creature. A few miners rounded up 3,000 orens to have the creature killed. Remus supposedly took the coins and ran. Low on funds to pay for the room he'd been in, Geralt leaves Roach behind as he sets out for Temria to find Remus.
Geralt arrives in Temeria and listens in on the disgruntled miners. They accuse him of being like the witcher before, who they believe to have taken their money and ran. Geralt only takes pay after the job is done and for a third of the price. He also extends an apology. Ostrit arrives with several of his soldiers. He demands the miners disperse in exchange for him not charging them with treason. As for Geralt, Ostrit orders his men to see Geralt out of Temeria.
Ostrit's men suddenly fall off the horses and onto the ground as they near Temeria's border. A sorceress by the name of Triss Merigold reveals herself to Geralt and offers to hire him. She serves King Foltest, but she is acting under her own agenda. Rather than kill the beast, she wants Geralt's help in saving it.
Six years ago, stable hands started vanishing at the castle above the city. Before long, citizens were disappearing throughout all of Temeria. They soon realized that the creature was coming from the crypt, where the king's sister Adda was laid to rest. Rumor has it that she was having an affair with a young man in town when she died and that she was with child. If that were true, it would be the sole heir to the Temerian empire. The king fled the castle ignoring the rising death toll. So, Triss was sent 3 months ago to kill the creature.
Geralt initially believes the creature to be a different monster, but Triss informs him otherwise. She takes him to the tomb to examine the corpses' of those killed by the creature. He examines Remus' corpse and comes to the conclusion that Triss covered up his death to hide the fact that the creature bested a witcher. Upon further examination, Geralt discovers that Remus is missing both his heart and liver. Only a Striga's eating habits are that selective. They're very rare and can only be created through a curse. Meaning someone wanted Adda dead. Only the curse didn't stop with Adda, and it turned her daughter into a monster. Meaning the striga is also the Princess of Temeria.
Triss Merigold presents Geralt to King Foltest, Lord Ostrit, and Captain Segelin, with whom she pleads with to enlist in Geralt's help. However, Segelin is skeptical of Geralt's claims that Princess Adda was murdered. Triss hopes that the king will allow her to search the abandoned castle for clues as to who killed her, however, they fear that Geralt will kill the princess. Geralt explains that the creature grew inside of Adda, feeding on her womb and mutating. Growing for years until she got so hungry that she was forced to slither out. Essentially an "overgrown abortion." The king has grown tired of their claims and commands that everyone leaves.
As they exit, Geralt pushes Segelin out last and locks the door behind him. He takes this time to ask the king who the father is of Adda's child, and why he never married and produced his own heir. Not to mention he's done nothing to stop the striga. All this points to King Foltest being the father. Foltest surmises that the rumors of witchers being devoid of heart and emotion must be true in order for Geralt to accuse him of incestuous affairs with his sister while simultaneously campaigning that he kill his own daughter. The guards break through the door, and Foltest orders Geralt to leave Temeria.
Geralt and Triss Merigold hide outside the abandoned castle. She asks if he's going to kill the striga. Geralt replies that he doesn't want the miners' coins. He and Triss manage to sneak into the castle, where they discover letters from the former queen of Temeria in Adda's bedroom. The letter details Queen Sancia urging her children to end their affair. Geralt and Triss take this discovery to Ostrit under the suspicion that the former queen cursed her children. Ostrit claims that he was Adda's confidant and protector. He believes that Foltest raped Adda and cursed the child to cover it up. However, according to Geralt, Ostrit's scent was all over Adda's sheets. Old ones and new ones. He smelled what Ostrit was doing in there. At this point, Ostrit confesses to being Adda's lover and placing the curse on her, albeit unintentionally. Geralt asks how to lift the curse, but Ostrit refuses to tell him, as he wants to see Foltest punished for defiling Adda. And so, Geralt simply knocks him out with a single punch.
Foltest meets Geralt at the entrance to the abandoned castle, where the striga lies. Geralt honestly answers that he doesn't know if this will work or if the princess will be normal if she's cured. All she's ever known her entire life is rage and hunger. Geralt then gives Foltest a gift to give his daughter in case the curse is lifted, but Geralt doesn't make it through the night. Foltest claims that both he and Adda initially tried to resist their urges, but what they felt was too powerful. He envies Geralt's mutation to live and never have to fall in love.
Within the castle, Geralt ties Ostrit to Adda's bed. Once again, he asks Ostrit how to lift the curse, but he refuses, demanding that Foltest pays for what he did. Ostrit reluctantly reveals that a woman was hiding from the Brotherhood. She sold him a lamb and told him to wait until the full moon and then kill it. Then he recited an elven chant and bathed in the lamb's blood until sunrise when a rooster crowed three times. Geralt realizes that the only way to cure the princess is to keep her out of her crypt until sunrise.
The striga rises from its crypt. Geralt leaves Ostrit behind, still tied to the bed. The striga approaches, and Ostrit begs for his life, claiming to have loved Adda. He is killed nonetheless.
Geralt comes face-to-face with the creature. He tries to entrap it with silver chains, but to no avail; the striga breaks free. A fight ensues between Geralt and the striga, which ultimately results in the creature being knocked unconscious. While the striga is down, Geralt places a barrier over the entrance, preventing it from leaving. When the striga runs for it, the barrier knocks it back. Geralt puts on some brass knuckles and knocks the striga to the ground. As the sun rises, both he and the striga race for the crypt. Geralt gets to it first and seals himself inside.
The sun rises, and the striga has transformed into a girl. The curse is lifted. Geralt slowly approaches. She turns around and slices his throat with her claws. He bites her neck to get her off of him and passes out.
Geralt awakens shortly after being healed by Triss. She informs him that the princess is fine and that King Foltest issued a statement that Lord Ostrit gave his life defeating the creature. The miners are building a statue in his honor. Triss asks about Renfri, whose name Geralt uttered while sleep. He doesn't reply, simply asking for his money. She asks if all life is to him is monsters and money. He claims that it is. She doesn't believe that. There's a vortex of fate around each of them. Drawing their destiny closer with each decision they make. Triss hands him his money and returns the gift he left for the princess.
Royal Betrothal.
In 1249, Geralt enters a tavern after killing a selkiemore. Jaskier starts to sing a tune in favor of Geralt and the townspeople in the tavern join in, celebrating Geralt's victorious battle against the beast. Jaskier asks Geralt for a favor. In exchange for acting as his bodyguard for the night, Geralt will receive food, women, and wine.
Jaskier requires protection while attending a royal betrothal as every lord, knight, and king will be in attendance, many of which he's personally crossed, having had affairs with their lovers. Jaskier questions what happens to witchers as they age. Geralt explains there is no after for his kind. They hunt until they get killed. And he wants nothing more than that for himself.
Geralt and Jaskier enter the Cintra castle. Geralt is immediately recognized by an old associate of his, Mousesack. He warns Geralt that this can take all night as every suitor near and far are vying for Princess Pavetta's hand. Mousesack informs Geralt that the ceremony is rigged. Crach an Craite, unbeknownst to most, is already set to marry Pavetta. Her mother, the Lioness, Queen Calanthe, has already arranged it with Craite's uncle, Eist Tuirseach, whose proposal to Queen Calanthe was refused three times according to Mousesack. Geralt comes to Jaskier's defense as he's being interrogated by one of the noblemen, who believes caught Jaskier having an affair with his wife.
Geralt bares witness as Crach and another guest gets into an argument, both claiming to have defeated manticores. He initially claims that they're both lying, but to prevent a fight from ensuing, he suggests that maybe they encountered subspecies of manticore. Queen Calanthe inquires about his encounter with the elves. Geralt explains that he got his ass kicked and was about to have his throat cut when Filavandrel spared his life. Queen Calanthe admires Geralt's willingness to paint himself in the shadow of his failures and invites him to take a seat by her side.
Geralt explains to the queen that he's only there to protect Jaskier from vengeful cuckolds. However, she hopes that should chaos ensue that'll she'll be able to count on him to strategically move certain irritants. Geralt insists that he's not for hire and only there to help a friend.
Queen Calanthe questions why there are so few witchers remaining. Geralt explains that since the sacking of Kaer Morhen, it is no longer possible to create more of them. Geralt asks why she chooses to risk her life on the battlefield when she can rest on the throne. For Queen Calanthe, there's a simplicity in killing monsters. Lord Urcheon of Erlenwald interrupts the ceremony, his face hidden under knight's armor. He's come to claim Pavetta's hand in marriage. Eist knocks his helmet off, revealing a monstrous form. Queen Calanthe requests that Geralt kill him, but he refuses as Urcheon is no monster, his appearance is caused by a curse placed on him. Queen Calanthe orders her guards to slay Urcheon instead. Urcheon disarms the guards and explains to Queen Calanthe that Pavetta belongs to him via the Law of Surprise. More of the queen's guards enter and they attack. Geralt comes to his defense. Together, they dispatch of Queen Calanthe's guards with little difficulty. An even larger fight ensues between the guests. Queen Calanthe stands in the centre room and commands the fighting to end.
Pavetta greets Duny and reminds him that she told him to stay away. It would appear Duny is Pavetta's secret lover. He explains that he was cursed as a young boy. He lived his whole life in misery until the day he saved Queen Calanthe's husband, King Roegner from certain death. By tradition, he chose the Law of Surprise as payment. Eist recommends that Queen Calanthe honor the tradition. Destiny has determined the surprise be Pavetta. Duny abandoned all hope of claiming the Law of Surprise when he heard the king returned to find a child on the way. He knew no woman could accept him as he is. So he waited until the twelfth bell when the curse breaks. He never intended to meet Pavetta. Only watch from afar. But destiny intervened and they fell in love. Both Eist and Mousesack advise Queen Calanthe to honor destiny's wish. Geralt agrees that a promise made is a promise to be honored. Queen Calanthe seems to accept destiny, handing over her sword and extending her hand to Duny. She pulls him close, whispers "there is no destiny", and pulls out a knife, aimed at his throat. Pavetta screams out, her abilities awakening, sending everyone flying across the room. Pavetta and Duny float above the room until Geralt knocks them down.
Queen Calanthe announces that the Law of Surprise will be honored and Pavetta will marry Duny. Furthermore, Queen Calanthe herself has agreed to marry Eist. There will be two vowels tonight. Pavetta kisses Duny, and he transforms back into his human form. Queen Calanthe's blessing of their marriage lifted the curse and fulfilled the destiny. Duny wishes to repay Geralt for saving his life. Geralt chooses the Law of Surprise. However, he doesn't actually intend to lay claim to anything. Pavetta suddenly throws up, signifying that she's pregnant moments after Geralt claims Law of Surprise.
Mousesack intends to stay and help guide Pavetta. He tries to convince Geralt to stay as well, pointing out her immense primal power. Like it or not, Geralt is bound to the family. Mousesack advises him against trying to outrun destiny. Geralt, however, doesn't believe in destiny. Crediting Pavetta's outburst to a girl using her magic to stop her mother from gutting her lover. Nonetheless, the bond that will come into being between Geralt and Pavetta's unborn child will be extraordinary. If he dismisses it and leaves without claiming the child surprise, he will unleash true calamity upon them all. Geralt is unconvinced and decides to take his chances.
Three Wishes from a Djinn.
Years have passed since the royal betrothal. Jaskier finds Geralt at the river's edge, fishing for a djinn that is buried at the bottom of the lake. Geralt can't sleep, and Jaskier concludes that his sleeplessness is directly related to what Mousesack said to him about the Law of Surprise and claiming Princess Pavetta's child. Geralt pulls a bottle inscribed with a wizard's seal from the lake. Inside contains the djinn. Jaskier wrestles with Geralt for control of the bottle, unintentionally releasing the djinn. Jaskier makes two of the three available wishes before shattering the bottle on the ground. As Geralt gathers the shattered pieces, Jaskier starts coughing up blood, and the djinn escapes.
Geralt takes Jaskier to a nearby elf healer named Chireadan and discovers that his afflictions are magic based. His throat is being attacked and if the spell's actions aren't halted as soon as possible, its effects may become irreversible, eventually resulting in death. The medicine given by the healer will provide Jaskier with a few more hours. He advises that Geralt take Jaskier to another town for help as the only mage in close proximity is extremely dangerous. Geralt disregards Chireadan's advise and sets off in search of this malicious mage, said to be imprisoned in the mayor's house.
Geralt and Jaskier break into the mayor's house to find him under some kind of trance. They stumble upon a massive orgy orchestrated by Yennefer of Vengerberg. The mage of Rinde. She deduces that he's a mutant, a witcher to be exact. The famous White Wolf, as she refers to him. She always imagined that he'd have fangs or horns. She questions just how powerful he is. Whatever the djinn did to Jaskier is spreading. Should Yennefer cure him, Geralt promises to indulge her curiosity. Yennefer agrees to his terms. She states the phrase "ragamuffin", and the citizens of Rinde awaken from their trance, completely unaware of their actions.
Yennefer has put Jaskier in a deep healing sleep. She remarks that he'll be out long enough for Geralt to bathe. She's even acquired his clothes. While Geralt bathes, she makes a point that fishing for a djinn is an extreme remedy for sleeplessness. Geralt replies that he's desperate. Yennefer undresses and sits back-to-back with Geralt in the bath. She questions if all witchers are as blessed as he is, being as they're made from magic. However, as Geralt explains, it didn't make for a happy childhood. Judging by Yennefer's scars, he can tell she didn't have much of a childhood either. He accuses her of capitalizing on the political situation of Rinde, though Yennefer claims that she's serving the stifled townspeople. Ultimately, they both know there's more to the other's claim than they're revealing. Fortunately for Geralt, Yennefer has decided that his company and conversation is payment enough for her services.
Geralt watches over Jaskier as he sleeps. Even if he won't admit it, Jaskier is a friend, and Geralt said some things to him that he doesn't want to be the last thing Jaskier remembers. Yennefer assures Geralt that Jaskier will survive and recover his vocal talents. Geralt looks around and realizes that Yennefer is attempting to trap the djinn. Yennefer explains that it's tied to this plane and its master. With Jaskier only making two wishes, Yennefer needs him to make his third so that she can capture it. Geralt is taken over by the sudden smell of lilac and gooseberries. Yennefer kisses him and in that moment has full control of him.
Geralt awakens in a cell with Chireadan after a supposed rampage. Although he doesn't recall anything, he allegedly attacked a pawnbroker and an apothecary, both of whom are on the town council and are voting to usurp the mayor and kick Yennefer out of Rinde. Yennefer had Geralt enact revenge on her behalf. Chireadan tried to stop him, but the guards assumed he was there to abet. The sentence is to be cast by the same council members Geralt attacked. It is sure to be death. Chireadan questions why Geralt would go see Yennefer despite his warnings. Although, admittedly, he could've better prepared Geralt, who questions if Chireadan is under her spell as well. But Chireadan isn't under a spell cast by Yennefer, he's in love with her.
A guard enters and begins attacking Geralt as they've been sentenced to death. As he prepares to finish him off, Geralt makes a wish; that the guard would burst, and he does just that. His head explodes. As it turns out, Geralt has the wishes, not Jaskier.
Geralt arrives just as Jaskier is exiting the mayor's home. He realizes that Yennefer is trying to become the vessel in order to gain more power and rushes inside to prevent her from killing herself. Yennefer is struggling to maintain the djinn. It's getting stronger because as Geralt explains, it is he who has the wishes. Geralt refuses to make the last wish in fear that Yennefer becoming a vessel for the djinn would have her lose control. Yennefer becomes unstable. The house itself starts to collapse. In order to stop her, Geralt makes his final wish and the djinn is freed. The building then caves in on them.
Before they are crushed by the building around them, Yennefer manages to portal herself and Geralt downstairs. She blames him for the djinn's escape and the mayhem it will surely wreak. Geralt informs her that djinn are only dark creatures when they're held captive. He's certain that it won't cause much harm now that it's free. The heat of the moment aroused them, Geralt and Yennefer then proceed to have sex. Afterwards, Yennefer asked him what his last wish was, but Geralt had already fallen asleep.
Hunting a Dragon.
Six years have passed since he met Yennefer and they began a relationship, Geralt and Jaskier were approached by Borch Three Jackdaws and his two Zerrikanian companions Téa and Véa. They sought Geralt out hoping to gain his assistance in slaying a green dragon that had landed across the border in King Niedamir's mountains. Locals spotted it and went after it in search of treasure. They succeeded only in wounding the creature and angering it so righteously that it swooped down from its lair and set half a hillside ablaze. The king was set to marry the princess of a rival kingdom, Malleore, and he's concerned with the creature's presence. So, he commissioned a hunt to kill it and four teams had signed on. The winner got the dragon's treasure board and the title of lord over one of King Niedamir's vassal states.
Geralt initially declined Borch's offer as he didn't kill dragons. However, Borch was in need of one final adventure, and he thought that killing a dragon would bring him that. With a witcher on his team, he'd be unstoppable. Joining them on the hunt were a group of dwarves and Reavers. With the introduction of Yennefer and Eyck of Denesle as the fourth team, Geralt agreed to join Borch on his hunt, much to Jaskier's disapproval.
Geralt and Jaskier spoke to Yennefer for the first time in years. She couldn't help but wonder why she kept running into Geralt despite walking the earth for decades prior and never meeting a single witcher. She explained that she was there to accompany Eyck as he was to slay the dragon.
While on the path to kill the dragon, Geralt and Borch were only a few feet behind Yennefer and Eyck. In that time, Borch realized that Geralt was in love with her. They reached the hillside scorched by the dragon, a creature that tended to avoid people. Geralt questioned why it hadn't yet left. Borch replied that the beast much becoming desperate. Jaskier suddenly came face-to-face with a hirikka while picking berries for Tèa and Vèa. Geralt surmised that the creature was starving and of no danger to them. Eyck completely disregarded him and killed it.
All four groups decided to settle down on the mountainside. Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Tèa, Vèa, Yennefer, Eyck, Yarpen, the leader of the dwarves, and Boholt, the leader of the Reavers roasted the hirikka and feasted. However, Borch warned Eyck against eating a certain part of the creature. Another warning that went unconsidered by Eyck. "A great knight never wastes a kill", he replied. It's why he'd make a great lord after slaying the dragon. With Yennefer as his mage. Boholt interrupted them and made a lewd remark towards Yennefer. Eyck took his leave as his stomach started to gurgle after failing to heed Borch's warning. They proceeded to discuss how the rightful son of Nilfgaard had returned and started burning through the south. With Fringilla as his mage. Wouldn't be long before they tried to take Sodden.
Jaskier doubted the mere existence of dragons until Geralt assured them to be real, though their numbers were dwindling. Green dragons were the most common. Red dragons less so. Black dragons were the rarest. Borch added that gold dragons were, in fact, the rarest. Geralt retorted that they were a myth. Whether that be true or not, gold dragons met the same fate of any other dragon; they died out.
Yennefer awakened the following morning to find Eyck missing. Yarpen found him dead by a tree with his pants down and throat slit. Nevertheless, the hunt continued. Yarpen suspected that the Reavers killed Eyck, and so he knew of a short cut across the mountains that he only shared with Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Tèa and Vèa. Proposing a truce until they reached the next peak. Geralt tried to convince Yennefer to join them on the shorter path. Much like Yarpen, Yennefer suspected that Boholt killed her escort before he could accomplish the one task she needed him for. Yennefer revealed there are certain healing properties dragons are said to possess. However, Geralt informed her that fertility cures using fresh dragon hearts were a myth. Geralt also didn't believe she'd make a good mother. Yennefer explained that she wanted her choice to bear a child back. Geralt informed her that witchers can't bear children either. They were made sterile because their lifestyle wasn't suited for a child. He then unintentionally revealed to Yennefer his Child Surprise.
Yarpen and his men have guided Geralt, Jaskier, Yennefer, Borch, Tèa and Vèa to a fairly narrow path lined with wooden boards alongside the mountain. A tight squeeze for anyone larger than that of a dwarf. The board broke beneath Borch's feet and he falls, as does Tèa and Vèa. The only thing preventing them from plummeting to the ground was Geralt holding on to the other end of the chain. Borch told Geralt to let him go. When Geralt refused, Borch let go of the chain, shortly followed by Tèa and Vèa, and the three of them disappeared within the fog as they fell to the ground below.
Jaskier told Geralt that he did his best to save them. There wasn't much he could do. He suggested that they give up on the hunt and provided Geralt give him another chance to prove himself as a worthy travel companion, they head for the coast.
Geralt entered Yennefer's tent, which she had placed a spell on to make much larger on the inside than outside. Yennefer admitted to being worried for Geralt on the mountain. Her scent was mesmerizing. The moment he dreaded most every time she left is when it faded. Yennefer reminded Geralt that it was he who left first in Rinde. She woke up in the destroyed house, and he was gone. Geralt asked for forgiveness, the two kissed and made love, while Geralt undressed her.
After having sex, Yennefer questioned if the rumors were true about witchers being devoid of human emotion. Geralt explained that was false. People say whatever justified despising his kind. If the choice had been him, Yennefer wondered what Geralt would've been instead of a witcher. Much like Geralt, Yennefer didn't have much of a choice in being a mage. She always dreamed of becoming important to someone someday. Beginning to fall asleep, Geralt assured Yennefer that she was important to him now.
Yennefer woke up the following morning to find Geralt still at her side. At a quick pace, they could make it back to the Pensive Dragon before sundown, however, Yennefer had no intentions of turning around. She was still intent on killing the dragon. She then rushed off to the dragon's cave after noticing the dwarves were already ahead of her.
Geralt eventually caught up to Yennefer in the cave only to find out that Tèa and Vèa were alive, and the green dragon was dead. But she was not alone. Enter the gold dragon, who revealed itself to be Borch. When the dragoness was injured, her cry was heard by Villentretenmerth. But the egg could not be moved or the life inside it would die, which is why she attacked instead of fleeing. She was protecting her baby by scaring the people away from her and her egg. That's when Borch, Tèa and Vèa heard about the king's hunt and realized they had to keep their enemies close. So, Borch came to find Geralt, the knight who was taught to save dragons rather than kill them. Boholt and his gang of Reavers arrived, forcing Geralt, Yennefer, Tèa, and Vèa to defend the dragons.
Geralt and Yennefer defended one entrance to the cave while Tèa and Vèa defended the other. They are faced with Boholt and one remaining Reaver. Yennefer made sure that it was her who killed Boholt. Afterwards, Borch paid off Yarpen and his men; offering them teeth belonging to the green dragon to take to the king as proof of its demise.
Borch thanked Geralt and Yennefer for all their help in defending him and his family. He noted that he sees why Geralt didn't want to lose her. Yennefer questioned the meaning behind this, and Geralt revealed that he was referring to Rinde and their encounter with the djinn. That was why they couldn't escape each other. Because Geralt wished for it. Yennefer took that to mean that her feelings for Geralt were also magic, though he insisted that wasn't true. An argument ensued, resulting in the two parting ways. Borch saved them both a lot of hurt with a little pain now. He revealed that Yennefer would never regain her womb, and Geralt would lose Yennefer. Borch informed Geralt that he was still missing his legacy and destiny.
Geralt grew angry and blamed Jaskier for all his recent troubles. The Child Surprise. The djinn. All of it could be traced back to him. Geralt exclaimed that if life could give him one blessing, it would be to take Jaskier off his hands. With that being said, Jaskier would get the story from the others to write his song and depart.
Imprisoned in Cintra.
One years after the dragon hunt and separation from Yennefer, Geralt arranged a meeting with Mousesack to ensure his Child of surprise was healthy and being taken care of. Mousesack revealed to him that the child is actually a girl, informed him that Princess Cirilla had been raised by Calanthe since her parents died. Pavetta and Duny's ship was lost at sea. Geralt warned Mousesack that he saw an army of Nilfgaard soldiers making camp at the Amelia Pass. Mousesack assured Geralt that the queen had done everything she could to ensure her family's safety. Geralt suddenly spotted men moving through the tunnels. He suspected that Calanthe got word of his arrival and sent assassins to kill him. Surrounded and outnumbered, Geralt held Mousesack hostage. In order to get to him, they'd first have to kill Mousesack. They charged with their weapons, and so Mousesack was forced to portal himself and Geralt to safety.
Geralt and Mousesack confronted Calanthe. Geralt had been away for 12 years and planned on staying that way until Calanthe sent eight men to kill him. Geralt came to protect Ciri, who Calanthe raised on her own. When Calanthe tried to buy Geralt off, Mousesack interjected that money can't undo the Law of Surprise. King's who've tried to outbid destiny ended up on pikes. Danek and Lazlo drew their swords as Geralt approached. He advises Calanthe to give the child over to him if she had any doubt in her mind that Ciri wasn't safe in Cintra. Geralt promised to take her, protect, and bring her back unharmed. Calanthe reluctantly agreed and exclaimed to the townspeople that the Law of Surprise had been called.
Geralt entered Calanthe's chambers to meet Ciri. Unbeknownst to him, Calanthe had no intentions on giving her up, and instead, disguised someone else's child as Ciri and handed her over to Geralt. Mousesack watched on silently. Calanthe then told Geralt that she'd summon him when Ciri was ready to leave. Geralt exited Calanthe's chambers and followed the passageway through a hidden door that magically opened. The tunnel led him outside of the castle, where the girl impersonating Ciri was saying goodbye to her friends, the real Ciri being amongst them.
Geralt confronted Calanthe after realizing that she tried to send him off with a girl that wasn't Princess Cirilla. Calanthe insisted that Ciri was safe with her until the day came that she would take over the throne. Furthermore, she refused to give Geralt word any further thought. The last time she listened to him, she let a hedgehog into her court, which ultimately resulted in Pavetta's death. Calanthe refused to lose Ciri the same way she lost Pavetta and ordered Eist to get Geralt out of her kingdom.
Geralt recalled when Eist honored the Law of Surprise. Eist explained that was before he had a granddaughter. Assuming Cintra was attacked by Nilfgaard, Eist would be right by Calanthe's side. Geralt accused him of putting too much faith in the Queen, but he wasn't there when Pavetta died. Calanthe would wake up howling in the night. The Lioness, nearly broken. Someone that was able to pull themselves out of that would have Eist's confidence until his final day. He asked Geralt to promise that he wouldn't come back. When Geralt refused, Eist trapped him behind bars.
Geralt plotted his escape while trapped in the dungeon of Queen Calanthe's castle as Nilfgaard invaded. He attacked one of the guards and freed himself from his cell. Geralt made it outside, where he disposed of several Nilfgaard invaders. Geralt watched from the shadow as the Nilfgaard army took Cintra. Suddenly, he heard a loud thud. Upon investigation, he discovered it was the queen. She jumped out her window, to her death. Geralt ran back into the castle to find Ciri. Instead, he found several Nilfgaard soldiers, all of whom he murdered when they refused to tell him where to find her.
Bitten by a Ghoul.
Cintra went up in flames in the aftermath of the Nilfgaard attack. Geralt remained in the castle, still in search of Princess Cirilla. He left the kingdom after realizing that she was already gone. During his travels, he came across a decimated Cintran refugee camp. There, he crossed paths with a merchant named Yurga, giving them a proper burial. Geralt sensed danger and advised the man to leave the grounds. Instead, Yurga stayed to ensure the bodies were properly laid to rest. In doing so, he was attacked by ghouls, who emerged from the ground beneath his feet. Luckily, Geralt returned to save Yurga. But he was bitten in the process of slaying the creatures. The bite took effect almost instantly, and Geralt passed out.
Yurga travelled through the woods of Sodden with Geralt going in and out of consciousness on the back of his carriage. The ghoul bite made him delirious, but he was still alive. In his delirious state, Geralt recalled moments with his mother, Visenna, where she instilled in him a moral code; "we must live and let live."
Geralt awakened on the back of Yurga's carriage. He inquired about the nearby explosions. Yurga informed him that Nilfgaard was attacking Sodden. Geralt then drank a black elixir from his bag and poured some on his wound. He requested that Yurga take him to the Blue Mountains, where someone would be able to save him. In his delusional state, he recalled more memories with his mother. With him on the back of the carriage that she steered. She stopped and ask him to get water from a nearby creek. By the time he returned, his mother was gone, but Vesemir was waiting for him.
Still infected by his ghoulish bite, Geralt's condition worsened. He began hallucinating Renfri and Yennefer. Lastly, he hallucinated actually seeing his mother. She explained that he was saved by his pulse. Which was four times slower than that of a normal man. She heard a merchant's cry for help and decided to help as healing was her profession. She said to him "people linked by destiny will always find each other." Geralt grew so angry at the sight of her. He asked if she liked his eyes and if she knew what they did to witchers to improve their eyes. It didn't always work. Only three out of ten boys survived the trial to become a witcher. He questioned if his mother knew this when she gave him up to Vesemir. She told him not to ask any more questions as the answers would only hurt them both. Instead, she urged Geralt to find Princess Cirilla. Geralt awakened from his sleep, asking Yurga where the woman went, but she was never actually there. He then asked how far is Yurga's house from Sodden, to which he replied an hour on a swift enough horse. Geralt hopped on the back of Yurga's carriage headed for Sodden. While Yurga's can't repay Geralt for saving his life, he can offer him the Law of Surprise.
Yurga arrived home with Geralt on his back carriage. Zola, his wife, told Yurga how she met an orphan girl in the woods nearby. Hearing Yurga's conversation with his wife reminded Geralt of Renfri telling him to find the "girl in the woods." Geralt jumped off the back off the carriage and into the woods, where he met Ciri for the first time, as she ran into his arms. "People linked by destiny will always find each other", he says to her. She then asked who is Yennefer.
Lifting Nivellen's Curse.
After meeting Ciri in the forest, Geralt traveled with her to the site of the Battle of Sodden Hill, in search of Yennefer. He learned from Tissaia that they won the battle thanks to Yennefer. Upon realizing that she died, Geralt took Tissaia's response as an acknowledgment of Yennefer's death. He asked if winning the war was worth Yennefer's life. Geralt held back tears as he walked back towards Ciri. She asked Geralt who Yennefer was, but he said it didn't matter anymore because Yennefer was dead. Geralt and Ciri continued their journey. Resting, Ciri tried to get some sleep, but couldn't. Geralt told Ciri that he couldn't sleep well either. Changing the subject, Ciri wonders about the law of surprise, Geralt explains that he saved his father's life, which earned him the law of surprise. Geralt explained that Ciri's father did not know what he was going to reveal; although, it was not a guarantee from Ciri.
After, Geralt and Ciri sought refuge from an old friend of his, Nivellen, who discovers that he had been cursed by a priestess and turned into a beast after trashing the Temple of the Lionheaded Spider while high on godflesh mushrooms. He let Geralt and Ciri take refuge in his house. Nivellen magically summoned a hot bath for Ciri, while taking Geralt out for a beer. After the bath, Ciri joins Nivellen and Geralt. Nivellen called a banquet and told Ciri how he and Geralt met.
Geralt and Nivellen met many years ago when he was hired by Nivellen's father to get rid of a Wyvern infestation. Nivellen tried to prove himself to his father by killing one first, but instead fell into their lair. Luckily, Geralt saved him and slayed the wyvern. He then handed Nivellen the wyvern's head and told his father that Nivellen was the one who killed it.
After dinner, Geralt wondered about the village at the foot of the abandoned hill. Nivellen replied that deserters and thieves roamed the countryside in search of loot. The townspeople decided to leave to save themselves after the Battle of Sodden. Geralt was not convinced that the Battle of Sodden would cause an entire town to leave their home. Nivellen told him it was because of the Wild Hunt. Ciri knew them as the Wraiths of Morhogg, she says her grandfather saw them before the fall of Cintra, but Geralt said his grandfather was just a drunk. Geralt was still not convinced, so Nivellen told him that the end of days might come. He responded that he had gone through the Dark Ages, as well as three supposed end of days. He told Nivellen that the end of days was nothing but bullshit. Hearing scratching and cooing from the ceiling, Nivellen assured them that he had a cat. However, Geralt wanted to investigate. While outside with Roach, Geralt noticed footprints in the snow outside the estate and after a few steps they disappeared.
Suspecting Nivellen was hiding something, Geralt challenged him to a drinking game, hoping to get some answers. They threw daggers at a portrait of Nivellen's father, and whoever missed had to drink and tell a truth. Unfortunately for Geralt, missed every throw, whereas Nivellen had near perfect aim and asked what changed Geralt after willingly spending many lifetimes alone. Geralt replied that it was not what but who, Yennefer, who she unfortunately died, as far as he was aware of. Nivellen was intrigued that someone like Yennefer could win the heart of a witcher. Geralt then pulled his own knife from his boot and hit the portrait spot on, uncovering the fact that Nivellen was cheating with magic knives, leading Geralt to question what he was hiding. He refused to tell her and went to relieve himself.
Geralt checked Nivellen to see if he was asleep. Then he went to the town below to investigate. Immediately, inside he saw frozen corpses. Geralt drew his sword and prepared for the worst. Geralt investigated the corpses and found bloody footprints. The footprints stopped and left only a few drops of blood before disappearing. Geralt knew that thing could fly.
Upon discovering that there was a bruxa nearby, Geralt warned Ciri to leave the house and followed the sounds of her purring to Nivellen's room, where the Bruxa, Vereena, is draining his blood from him. A fight ensued, which eventually led outside, where Geralt managed to wound Vereena before beheading her. It was then that not only was Nivellen's curse broken due to the death of his true love but that he revealed the real reason behind his curse: he raped the priestess. The ugly truth left Geralt and Ciri somewhat disappointed. Geralt decided to remain silent and simply leave. Nivellen begged Geralt to kill him, but Geralt said he could kill himself since he became mortal again. 
Returning to Kaer Morhen.
Geralt and Ciri arrived at Kaer Morhen, where he reunited with his witcher brethren. While everyone celebrated, the witcher Lambert told a story about a job he once had. When Eskel arrives boasting, after a six-hour fight against a leshy. He brought the monster's hand as proof. Eskel told everyone that he could have ended the fight sooner, but he had lost all of his elixirs. Vesemir told Eskel that the fire through a leshy's heart would kill it. He questioned his story and asked if he didn't think about the monster's weakness. The other witchers, including Geralt, also began to doubt. Instead, Eskel turned his attention to Ciri and asked who she was, and she introduced herself as the Princess of Cintra.
Trained outside, Geralt was lightly scolded by Vesemir for claiming his Child Surprise and bringing her within their walls. He told him that adopting the Law of Surprise was a big mistake. Previously, Geralt had told Vesemir that he was not going to take the girl. However, he had to save her. He knew that keeping her safe would be long enough to discover her secrets. It wasn't long after her arrival that Ciri began pushing to start training, but Geralt warned her that it was too dangerous and that despite her hatred for the Black Knight, they don't kill out of fear, rather to save lives.
When they heard screams from the laboratory, Geralt goes to the cafeteria, where he sees that all the witchers were entertaining themselves with prostitutes. Geralt confronted Vesemir about all the prostitutes in Kaer Morhen. He told Vesemir that they shouldn't be there and that they should know. Vesemir told Geralt that Eskel had found the prostitutes on the way down the mountain. There was nothing to worry about, they wouldn't remember anything the next day. Geralt decided to confront Eskel, while Ciri spied. He seemed happy that the witchers were happy; However, Geralt wanted to set an example. He told Eskel not to have fun inside Kaer Morhen. Eskel wasn't really in the mood for scolding. Think life was unfair. Geralt returned with a princess while the rest of them almost died on their missions. Eskel tried to hit Geralt, but he anticipated the blow and managed to subdue Eskel. He told Eskel to go to sleep.
Geralt later asked Vesemir if he had seen Ciri, Vesemir jokingly told him that she was hitting a guy named "white seagull" while dancing on the table. Geralt laughed sarcastically and asked him the truth. He told Geralt that he had seen Ciri spying. He sent her to bed after talking to her. Vesemir wondered if he was ready for the duties of caring for and keeping Ciri safe. Geralt revealed that he was in a cell in Cintra the day the kingdom fell. He had heard everything, fires, screams and deaths. The same sounds I used to hear the day Kaer Morhen fell as a child. Vesemir was the only surviving witcher. He wondered if he was ready back then when he took them in and helped them become witchers.
Vesemir said that he had not been ready that day, but he did not protect them. I let them fend for themselves like I teach them. Geralt acknowledged that he would do the same with Ciri. After their conversation, they felt Kaer Morhen reverberate. All of his witcher medallions vibrated which alerted everyone. They got the prostitutes to safety, while Vesemir told Geralt to stay and fight instead of looking for Ciri.
Geralt and the other witchers scattered throughout the fortress to find the intruder. Enterd the laboratory, where Geralt found a leshy. Noted the prostitute who was with Eskel before, dead. leshy attacked Geralt, but he managed to counter. After a few attacks, the leshy managed to grab Geralt. He found a torch and burned the monster's vines. Geralt, to his surprise and confusion, noticed the witcher's medallion on the leshy's chest. He looked at his face and saw that it was actually Eskel. He realized that the leshy he fought with Eskel earlier had infected him and turned him into a leshy. With Vesemir's help, they were able to restrain him using hooks connected to chains. However, when Vesemir's life was nearly taken, Geralt had no choice, set his sword on fire and stabbed Eskel in the heart, killing him.
This close call within the walls convinced Geralt it was time to teach Ciri how to defend herself.
Laying Eskel to Rest.
There was anguish among the witchers when Geralt told Ciri to take a break from training. Lambert did not agree with Geralt killing Eskel. They had lost a brother. Geralt replied that what he had killed was not his brother. When Geralt left the cafeteria, he had a flashback of him and Eskel. He went to the laboratory where Vesemir was searching for the cause of Eskel's transformation. He didn't want to give up, but Geralt told him it was time to let him rest.
Geralt and Vesemir carried Eskel's body to a cave, where they laid his body to rest. Geralt felt as if the Continent was evolving underneath their feet. Still, Vesemir was determined to figure what happened and what he could have possibly missed in his tests. As the wolves arrived to consume Eskel's flesh, Geralt and Vesemir made their way out of the cave.
They returned home, where they discovered Ciri on the witcher training course, which she nearly completed until she stumbled and hit the ground at full force. As Geralt patched her up, he told Ciri that just because she could do anything, doesn't mean that she had to, as Ciri wasn't afforded the same healing ability as witchers. Ciri left the room angrily. When Geralt found Ciri's scarf, inside a crack in the walls, he noticed that Eskel's roots had sprouted there when he became leshy.
Ciri continued training with Coën. Geralt interrupted her training and asked her to describe a strange sensation when something was chasing her. Ciri responded that she felt like she was being pulled that would lead her to the forest. Geralt and Ciri set off into the forest to find what was pulling her. Ciri asked Geralt why the sensation chose her. Geralt said that his mother Pavetta had revealed uncontrolled magical power on their wedding day. Apparently Ciri has inherited that power.
Geralt and Ciri followed the pull in her body as it led them to the very same leshy in the woods that infected Eskel. However, they watched as the leshy was ripped apart by a much bigger, deadlier, and unfamiliar creature. Geralt told Ciri to run whilst he fended the creature off, but the creature seemed particularly interested in Ciri. It chased after her, but Geralt came to the rescue, beheading the beast with his sword.
Investigating the Monolith.
Geralt continued his training of Ciri, with the duo scaling mountains, walking across rocks, and running through the woods, where he reunited with Triss, who he invited to Kaer Morhen to help train Ciri, who likely inherited an evolved version of her mother's untrained magic. However, Ciri hadn't exhibited any typical indicators of Chaos. She only seemed to have the power of foresight, as well as a pull that led them to the leshy, leading Geralt to suspect that the creatures could've been sent by a mage, and so Triss performed a test to determine any signs of mutagenic alchemy, but they wouldn't have results until morning. Until then, Triss proposed that she and Geralt stay together for the night, but he turned her down.
The following morning, Triss confirmed that there was no evidence of mutagenic alchemy. However, they uncovered stellacite, like from a monolith, both inside the leshy that turned Eskel and the creature Geralt killed, meaning they came from the same place, more specifically the same monolith. It was then that Ciri revealed that when Nilfgaard attacked Cintra, just outside the city walls, she caused a monolith to topple with her scream, which Geralt decided to investigate for himself, with help from Istredd, who Triss portaled Geralt to.
Geralt informed Istredd of his discovery and how he suspected that a new subspecies of monsters were emerging from a stellacite tower just outside Cintra and that monster were nesting in the subterranean structure for years. With this theory in mind, they decided to investigate and crawl down into the subterranean, where there wasn't a nest or any evidence of life. Historians have always theorized that monoliths were scars from the Conjunction of the Spheres, but monster didn't exist on their plane before the Conjunction. All species were on different planes until the spheres merged into one. A Conjunction like that would've required two things: a massive surge of energy and conduits to channel it, leading Istredd to suspect that the monoliths were actually conduits, meaning their monoliths were calling to the original spheres, opening a gateway between the spheres and the Continent.
Istredd wanted to know how Geralt knew the monsters and monoliths were linked, but Geralt was reluctant to tell him anything, as he didn't trust Istredd, who in a moment of transparency, revealed that he actually came to Cintra in search of Yennefer. It's from Istredd that Geralt learned that Yen was alive. He realized that Istredd loved Yennefer. The mage quickly responded that he never stopped loving Yennefer. Geralt was surprised by Istredd's statement. Geralt's eyes began to have hope again upon hearing that Yennefer survived after Sodden. Suddenly, Geralt heard Ciri's scream and her cry for help. However, they were forced to take cover as shards of stellacite began flying at them. This resulted in a portal opening and a chernobog of some kind emerging and flying away. 
Geralt portalled back to Kaer Morhen, where he stopped Vesemir just before he could inject Ciri with a new witcher mutagen, created from Ciri's blood. She wanted to be a witcher so that she no longer had to feel the pain of her past. However, Geralt explained that no one could forget who they were, including witchers. Their best chance was to kill the hatred they held on to and move on.
Reuniting with Yennefer.
Ciri and Geralt left Kaer Morhen. Geralt and Ciri hunted down a chernobog that escaped from the monolith. Unfortunately, this encounter doesn't go as planned and Roach is left badly wounded, leaving Geralt with no other option but to put her out of her misery. The duo proceeded to stage a trap for the beast that killed Roach. Ciri climbed up on top of a rock to lure the chernobog in. Just when it was nearly within reaching distance of her, Geralt appeared and killed the beast, shoving his sword through its chest.
Geralt and Ciri arrived at Melitele's Temple. Graduates of the temple school are known to become midwives, historians, healers, and witchers. Vesemir sent Geralt here when he was about Ciri's age to learn signs. They were joined by Nenneke, who embraced them both and took Ciri to her office. And after a chance to speak with her, Nenneke explained to Geralt that he was screwed no matter what. Kingdoms would want her for her status. Thousands had been killed in pursuit of her already, not to mention her Elder blood. Nenneke believed that she was a Child of Destiny, and that Geralt and Ciri were a part of one another. Geralt needed to find balance, and then maybe he might stand a chance of helping her.
While at the temple, Geralt had a surprise and unexpectedly reunited with Yennefer. Geralt was relieved to see the love of his life alive. They kissed but were interrupted by Ciri, who Geralt revealed was his Child Surprise. The trio then sit down and talk about what they have experienced. Noticing the tension between Geralt and Yennefer, Ciri leaves them to continue the conversation alone. The last time they saw each other was a bit tumultuous. Yennefer questioned what changed his mind about claiming Ciri. Many things changed his mind, and Yennefer was among them, he admitted. Yennefer revealed that she ran into Jaskier in Oxenfurt. He was in some kind of trouble with a mage using fire magic who was looking for Geralt and Ciri. Yennefer's heart had been beating fast the entire time. She was nervous, and Geralt questioned why, the reason to which being that some wounds refused to heal, she explained. Geralt asked Yennefer if she still wanted to have a child, Yennefer said that this time was different.
When Geralt and Yennefer discovered that the temple was under attacked, they found Ciri surrounded by fire and in the path of Rience and the Michelet brothers, who Geralt slaughtered whilst Yennefer and Ciri hid in a room. Geralt killed the brothers, but Rience managed to escape. He caught up to Yennfer and Ciri just in time to watch them go through a portal. He told Yennefer to stop, but she replied that she couldn't. Yennefer went through the portal and left with Ciri.
Hunting Down Yennefer.
After finding Redanian crowns on the bodies of the Michelte brothers, Geralt apologized to Nenneke for brining death to her temple, as the men were after Ciri, who he needed to find. Geralt is then portalled to Oxenfurt by Nenneke, where he broke Jaskier out of jail and asked for his help in tracking down Yennefer. Jaskier wanted to make sure Geralt meant it, since they had parted very bitterly the last time they saw each other. Geralt assured him yes.
Arriving at a river, while Jaskier takes a bath, Geralt wanted to know what Yennefer was doing in Oxenfurt. Jaskier replied that she had saved his life and was on the run after losing her magic. However, when she was imprisoned in the whorehouse, he recalled her magically disappearing after muttering an incantation about a hut, leading Geralt to come to the conclusion that she was in league with the Deathless Mother, also known as Voleth Meir, who was imprisoned by the first witchers and entombed in a hut, as she was a demon that fed on pain. Geralt didn't believe Yennefer could do something like that, but Jaskier suggested that she would, sacrificing Ciri to regain her magic.
On the other side of the stream, Geralt and Jaskier reunite with Yarpen Zigrin and his crew, whom Geralt asked to borrow a horse from, for which he would pay Yarpen double when he found some coin. On the way to Cintra, Geralt admitted that he had thought about avoiding Ciri's existence all this time, but that wouldn't have changed anything. He knew he was tied to Ciri's existence, which meant he needed to protect her from harm. Jaskier asked what he planned to do with Yennefer. Geralt says he could kill her if she hurt Ciri in any way. Before long, they arrived outside of Cintra, where they found Ciri and Yennefer under attacked by Nilfgaard. After killing the guards, Geralt drew his blade on Yennefer, who apologized for her betrayal. Geralt intended to stay behind and kill the Deathless Mother whilst Jaskier took Ciri back to Kaer Morhen. With the blade to her neck, Geralt forced Yennefer and she recited the incantation, but when they arrived at her hut, they discovered that Voleth Meir had escaped her prison. Geralt knew that Voleth Meir had had enough of pain and despair, which meant that she was at full power.
Saving Ciri.
Geralt returned to Kaer Morhen with Yennefer following him. Geralt blamed Yennefer for letting Voleth Meir to escape, she tried to plead her case and apologize for her actions, but Geralt wasn't interested in hearing her out. Yennefer wanted to protect Ciri from the Important Mother, but Geralt didn't want her to interfere. They headed inside, where they discovered that Ciri had been possessed by the Deathless Mother. They found her in Vesemir's room, where she attempted to pretend as if she was Ciri, but Geralt saw through her ruse, and she sliced his face before running off.
Geralt reasoned with Vesemir that killing Ciri was not the answer to his rage in response to the Deathless Mother killing some of the witchers in their sleep. Geralt reminded him that witchers didn't kill out of fear, they killed to save lives. She could be saved, Geralt assured him, but he'd need Vesemir's help to do it.
They found Voleth Meir in the cafeteria, standing before the medallion tree. Geralt offered up himself in exchange for Ciri, but Voleth Meir didn't desire him. The Deathless Mother unleashed a scream so loud that it cracked the medallion tree open and revealed a monolith hidden inside. She then shattered the monolith before opening a portal for two basilisks to exit, forcing the witchers to defend their home. Geralt asked Vesemir and Yrden to trap him inside a barrier with Ciri to try to reach her. Voleth Meir did his best to contain Ciri in his memories while fighting Geralt.
Another basilisk (large) exited the portal and charged for Geralt, pushing him outside the cafeteria as they fought on the bridge. Geralt fortunately managed to get the upper hand and slay the beast before rushing back into the cafeteria, where Vesemir then stabbed Ciri, but she healed herself within seconds. Noticing the jasper stone that Jaskier was supposed to give him at Yennefer's request, Geralt realized that their hate is the pain Voleth Meir needed to grow stronger. Instead of fighting, he pleaded with Ciri to hear his words and gain control. But without her hut, the Deathless Mother needed a vessel to exist within their sphere. So, Yennefer sacrificed herself, slit both her wrists, and summoned Voleth Meir, which caused the Deathless Mother to be transferred to Yennefer. Knew that Ciri was clinging to the illusion, Geralt told he that what she was seeing was not real. He had a family with them, and he just needed to return home. Ciri finally came to, passing out in Geralt's arms.
When Ciri finally regained consciousness, Geralt told her that she needs to catch Voleth Meir before she escapes, open a portal and send her through it, she can do it because Geralt believes in her. Ciri opened it, but crawled alongside Geralt and Yennefer into the portal temporarily. They arrived at Voleth Meir's home world, where she was released from Yennefer and joined the ranks of the Wild Hunt. The riders attempted to claim Ciri as the daughter of chaos for themselves. But Ciri managed to teleport herself, Geralt and Yennefer back to Kaer Morhen.
Ciri asked if the riders were the Wraiths of Morhogg, Geralt confirmed that they were, but assured that they were now safe thanks to her. Vesemir told Geralt that they needed to gather supplies and rebuild. Geralt did not know where Ciri had transported them to before, but he told Vesemir about the Wild Hunt. He knew they couldn't stay in Kaer Morhen any longer. So Geralt and Ciri needed to keep moving to avoid their enemies. Yennefer was whole again. She felt his magic return when she sacrificed herself for Ciri. Geralt didn't forgive her, yet he wanted Yennefer to join them and use her knowledge of magic to help train Ciri, as she was the only person who helped her control her power. Geralt recalled Vilentretenmerth saying they were made for each other, destined to be together, but that nothing would come of it because destiny alone wasn't sufficient. Something more was needed. Geralt believed that Ciri was that something more. He and Yennefer then joined Ciri on the bridge and assured her that they'd see her along the way of her destiny. Geralt now understood what the Deathless Mother wanted from her. She's been on their Continent since the Conjunction and simply wanted to get home to her sphere. What he can't figure out is how Nilfgaard knew about Ciri before anyone else.
In search of a home.
Geralt confronted and killed a group of men who were hired by Rience to find him and Ciri. Afterwards leaving Kaer Morhen, Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer are traveling across the continent in search of safety, avoiding the people who are after Ciri. Geralt, who has not yet forgiven Yennefer, speaks through letters, while she begins to train Ciri in the art of magic. Although she doesn't master it at all. In this state of mind, the trio changes places several times, when a mercenaries hired by Rience are after them. Geralt takes them to an even more remote location and they find refuge in a cabin owned by his good friend Yarpen. Months pass during winter, and everyone begins to feel comfortable with their peaceful life. It is at this point, Geralt begins to feel feelings for Yennefer again, when he sees her ice skating with Ciri. The three spend their days in harmony as a family.
One night, the trio attends the Belleteyn festival to enjoy their first social gathering in six months, performing incognito, as the event is known for its masks. Geralt and Yennefer finally talk and begin to remember their lovely nights together, and which of them left before dawn. The party is interrupted, in the maze, when they are unexpectedly ambushed by a jackapace. Once Geralt masters it, they decide to travel to another home. Rience had sent him to track down Ciri, using the scent of her blood that he stole in Kaer Morhen. Instead of continuing to seek shelter, the three decide to set a trap for Rience to lure him out and finish him off once and for all. Geralt asks Yarpen and Jaskier for help, the latter to act as Ciri's companion.
Fight at Shaerrawedd.
They arrive at Shaerrawedd to rest, where Geralt tells Ciri the story of a brave elf warrior, Aelirenn, the first elf hero to face humans and led her followers to their deaths "Neutrality. It won't get you a statue, but It will certainly help you stay alive." The next day, when he sensed Rience approaching, Geralt and Yennefer prepared to fight. Rience arrives accompanied by thugs to catch Ciri. Geralt and Yennefer go after Rience, while Yarpen leads Jaskier and his band of dwarven warriors to take down the fire mage's men. Rience escapes through a portal, Yennefer keeps the portal open as long as possible while Geralt goes after him. Fighting in a castle, Geralt realizes that Yennefer won't be able to hold out much longer, so he breaks both of Rience's hands, neutralizing her magical abilities, and returns to the ruins to save his friends. He returns, seeing that the elves have come to take Ciri, Geralt quickly overcomes the elves and they escape the ruins with heavy casualties. In the middle of the battle, Geralt kills Francesca's brother, Gage, when he tried to take Ciri.
After the battle in the ruins, Yennefer revealed to them that the portal used by Rience was born from a chaotic magic he had never felt before, meaning that Rience is being supported by a powerful mage. He also says that they should take Ciri to Aretuza, since the wizard school could help her speed up her training. Geralt shows the soft side of his heart and reveals that he trusts Yennefer to do what is best for Ciri. Although, this leads Geralt down a different path, since he decided to hunt down Rience to finish him off, so they must separate.
Hunting Rience.
Going their separate ways, Geralt, accompanied by Jaskier, visited detectives Codringher and Fenn, to seek information about the mysterious mage who is supporting Rience and why he is after Ciri. Unfortunately, Fenn reveals that Rience often meets his master in an abandoned castle called Vuilpanne, which is located on the outskirts of Piana, in the old ammonite mines of Redania, the same castle he was already in when he fought Rience. He also learns that Istredd was here looking for information about Ciri. Afterwards, Geralt left Jaskier behind as he did not want to put him in further danger and traveled to Vuilpanne.
Having found the castle abandoned, Geralt is convinced that he is walking into a trap. He enters with his sword in his hands and taking his elixirs. Soon, Geralt discovers a gruesome experiment in the castle's dungeons, a flesh monster made from the body parts of several young girls. Worse still, there is a fragile girl with green eyes and ashy hair, who seems untouched by the grotesque experiments. When he notices the young women taking part in the disturbing experience, they beg Geralt for help. He is forced to kill the monster when it threatens the young woman's life. Geralt rescues the girl. Once the girl wakes up and meets her savior, she reveals to Geralt that she is Ciri. Geralt is left somewhat confused, not knowing if the girl could be Ciri in disguise or if it is a plot by his enemies.
Helping the false Ciri.
Convinced that the girl has been altered to believe she is Ciri, Geralt asks for Jaskier's help. They take the false Ciri with Anika, a druidess who is a friend of her mother. At Anika's house, while she examines the young woman, she tells Geralt how she met Otto who lives with her, a werewolf, whom Geralt met years ago, when the villagers hired him to kill him. But instead, he gave him a cure that uses him as a necklace to avoid being werewolf. They met at the Temple of Truth about a year ago, she was there because of Visenna. Geralt was shocked and wondered if she is dead, Anika says that her mother talked a lot about him until the end.
Anika discovers that a mind control charm altered the false Ciri's mind, made with chaos, druid magic and even elven sorcery, because the young woman has elven blood. She gives her an extraction elixir to snap her out of her trance and find out who did this to her. Outside the house, Jaskier and Geralt talk about the deal Jaskier made with Philippa Eilhart. He tells him to take Ciri to Redania with King Vizimir, to be safe, something he agrees, Ciri is a princess and not a witch, but Geralt refuses to accept it. Just when he heard him say "source", Geralt remembered that the false Ciri said something about "source", so he ran back to the house, and woke up the false Ciri, despite Anika's warnings. They discover that the girl is actually called “Teryn” who was a novice in Aretuza, she was kidnapped by a man, accompanied by a woman with a “strange voice.” But unfortunately, the effect of the elixir was altered, before the girl could reveal the name of the mage. Someone takes control of Teryn's mind and tells Geralt that man, how the Destroyer of Worlds is coming for Ciri. Teryn also stole Otto's protective collar.
Geralt and Jaskier managed to subdue Otto, put his protective collar on him, and put Teryn to sleep. It is now known that the Destroyer of Worlds needs Ciri to fulfill his plans. In fact, they need Ciri so much that they are willing to recreate the young woman's Ancient Blood through vile experiments. Additionally, the Destroyer of Worlds has access to Aretuza, the same place Yennefer takes Ciri. So, Geralt decides to go there to protect her.
Later, after Anika woke up after being injured by Teryn, she tells Geralt about her mother's tragic death. Visenna was brutally beaten to death, because she was mistaken for an elf while helping a villager. Geralt is distraught by the news, forcing him to confront his past and the fact that his mother abandoned him when he was just a child. He hasn't forgiven her for abandoning him, but he didn't want her to suffer, he just wanted her to know what she did. Anika assured him that she did it only to save him, so Geralt vows to stay by Ciri's side and be a good father to her. Before leaving for Aretuza, I leave Teryn with Anika.
Geralt found Ciri traveling alone on the road when some ghostly horsemen were chasing her. The Wild Hunt tried to catch her. Geralt came to the rescue, using his magic tricks to destroy the Wild Hunt. However, they noticed that a piece of armor remained, proving that they were real.
Killing an Aeschna.
After saving Ciri from the Wild Hunt and discovering that they escaped her sphere, Geralt tells her that they will go to Aretuza. But Ciri initially doesn't want to go because she doesn't want to be around stuck-up women and the way they would treat her, and even felt bad after having a fight with Yennefer, Geralt assured her to forgive her. They meet Jaskier to board a raft that will help them travel directly to Aretuza. Seeing that they will not set sail due to the threat of a monster in the water, Ciri convinces Geralt to offer her services in exchange for a free trip. Feeling safe with the presence of a witcher, the owner of the Obin raft, he gladly with accepted it. On board, the trio is joined by a musical group led by Valdo Marx, a rival of Jaskier. Valdo and his company were invited to perform at the Aretuza Mage Conclave, which only makes Jaskier more irritated by their presence.
Despite Ciri and Geralt's warnings, Valdo and his company begin to sing in the middle of the trip. Their song attracts an aeschna, the aquatic monster. The aeschna takes down one of Valdo's fellow musicians before Geralt and Ciri confront the monster. Their combat is fierce, and Ciri demonstrates how much she learned under Geralt's tutelage. Ciri is even the one who delivers the final blow to the aeschna, an action that makes Geralt visibly proud.
After killing the monster, Ciri taunts Geralt with the idea of ​​leaving the Continent's strife behind and forging a new life, hunting monsters for gold. Impressed by how much she has grown, Geralt decided to share with her the horrors he witnessed in the abandoned castle, where there are dozens of girls due to a horrible experiment that the mage who supports Rience has done to them, and the only survivor Teryn, that he saved, who was brainwashed with Ciri's memories. Whoever is behind this wants to control Ciri's power. As such, Geralt and Ciri must go to Aretuza, reveal the truth and take down Rience's master. Otherwise, they would only be condemning more innocent lives. Ciri agrees with Geralt and, although she is still unsure of his purpose, knows that they must do whatever it takes to take down the mage.
Once they arrive in Aretuza, Yennefer greets them. Ciri apologizes to Yennefer for leaving early and she apologizes too and the two mend their mother-daughter bond. Geralt has a discussion alone with Yennefer, finally forgiving her for her past mistakes, they share a kiss and a warm hug.
Discussing the clues they discovered, Geralt and Yennefer conclude that the mage behind everything is Stregobor, which makes sense considering his penchant for strange experiments. Geralt wants to kill he, but Yennefer knows that they must first unmask the mage to the entire Brotherhood to prevent further chaos on the continent. Before the Mage Conclave takes place, the Brotherhood organized a party on the island of Thanedd so that people could mingle and release tensions. Geralt attends with Yennefer, dressed in a luxurious silver and black patterned suit, although he prefers her armor.
Aretuza ball.
Entering the party, Yennefer introduces him to the well-known mages, though surprised by Geralt's presence, the mages constantly monitor the witcher. During the party, Sabrina Glevissig tries to telepathically seduce Geralt right in front of Yennefer, but Geralt doesn't fall for it. He later socializes with Philippa, who tells Geralt everything that happens at the ball and Geralt wonders if she believes Rience's master is also present. However, they're interrupted by Dijkstra, who wishes to talk to Geralt alone. Once the men are by themselves, Dijkstra tries to convince Geralt to join his side and hand Ciri over to Redania, trying to say she'll be safe with them. However, Geralt sees through this ploy and rejects the offer.
A short time later, he finds Yennefer talking with Istredd, where she tells Geralt that Istredd was telling her about a dangerous book of monoliths that Stregobor has, making them suspect he might be behind everything happening on the continent but they need evidence. Before more can be said, the formal dancing starts and in which Geralt must participate. As Geralt rotates partners, he finds himself dancing with Lydia van Bredevoort, who he notices when he asks if she's enjoying the dance, she doesn't say a word. He then dances with Triss, who wonders about Ciri's safety, though Geralt reassures her that Ciri is safe for now. Exchanging partners and back to dancing with Yennefer, he tells her that he will create a distraction so she can sneak into Stregobor's office. Geralt then brushes up to Istredd and tells him to play along and the two pretends to fight over Yennefer, distracting everyone and allowing Yennefer to sneak off.
However, unbeknownst to the trio, Stregebor had a security measure in place so became alerted to someone snooping in his office and left the ballroom. Geralt followed behind, allowing him and Yennefer to confront Stregobor about the kidnapped noivces and torturing them to get to Ciri. In the midst of this, Tissaia, Vilgefortz, Istredd, Triss, and Artorius arrive while Geralt and Yennefer bring up the fact that he has a list of all the missing elvish novices and has been practicing mind control on them. Stregobor protests this, having no idea what they're talking about as Istredd finds the book of monoliths in the safe. Stregobor looks somewhat puzzled by the book being among his possessions, but the evidence says it all and Tissaia proposes to lock him up until the Conclave and be judged.
At the end of the evening, everyone toasts the alliance between all the mages of the north. In the process, they give special thanks to Yennefer, who designed this event. On this occasion, Geralt confesses his love to Yennefer for the first time and they kiss in front of everyone.
Later that night, Yennefer tells Geralt about the conversation between her and Philippa and how Philippa tried to persuade her to join her instead of serving the Brotherhood. She also told notes that Tissaia is a lot like Lydia, blinded by love and that she would follow her lover everywhere. As they unwind in their private room, feeling accomplished at having managed to thwart plans to get Ciri, something troubles Geralt until he realizes they were wrong. Connecting the dots, he realizes Lydia was the mage who couldn't speak and was communiting telepathically as the woman of the “strange voice” that Teryn mentioned and that Tissaia's bracelet, which the sorceress had lost during Stregobor's arrest and Yennefer had recovered, matched the same red stone that was in the pair of earrings Lydia wore at the dance. The two then realize the red stone itself can only be found in the mines in west Redania, where Geralt found the girls and Teryn, and as the only survivor she revealed that Rience worked together with a familiar face from Aretuza. Geralt and Yennefer then realize that the mage responsible for all the events is actually Vilgefortz, the man Lydia is in love with and the one who gave her the earrings.
Yennefer stays in her room and uses a locator spell to find Tissaia, while Geralt goes in search of Vilgefortz. However, once Geralt leaves the room, he hears the sounds of battle already beginning to echo through the hallways. Just right, Dijkstra comes out of the shadows, surprising him with a sword to his neck and says that Geralt should have chosen a side.

Yennefer (b. 1192) was a sorceress from Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn, before being recruited by Tissaia de Vries and brought to Aretuza to study magic. More than 30 years after her Ascension, she met Geralt of Rivia, whom she had mixed feelings for due to the circumstances of how they met.
Biography.
Tutelage at Aretuza.
In her home town of Vengerberg, Yennefer, a young lady with a curved spine and partial facial paralysis attempts to return a flower to two lustful lovers outside a barn. Disgusted by her appearance, they attack Yennefer, pinning her to the ground and hurling insults her way until she instinctively portals away to Aretuza. There, she meets Istredd, a young sorcerer who informs her that she's been marked. He then creates an untraceable portal to send Yennefer back home.
Having been marked from her portalling from Aretuza, a sorceress named Tissaia de Vries finds Yennefer and purchases her for four marks from her stepfather, less than half the price of a pig. Yennefer's mother objects, prompting her husband to denounce Yennefer as his daughter. Yennefer's cry for help is similarly futile. Yennefer is forcefully taken from her home in Vengerberg and locked in a room in Aretuza. She looks at herself in the mirror, disgusted at what looks back at her, and so shatters the mirror and grabs a shard of glass as she contemplates taking her own life. Despite slitting her wrists, Yennefer survives the night after her failed suicide attempt due to Tissaia's intervention.
Tissaia explains the dangers of magic and how each one of them showed an aptitude for controlling it, making them conduits of chaos, though magic itself is the control of chaos. She has gathered them for a trial: before each of them sits a flower and a stone, and they are to lift the stone without touching it. All of the initiates are able to lift the stone, with the exception of Yennefer. Discouraged by her failed attempt, Yennefer flees the greenhouse. She seeks out Istredd and introduces herself.
Later, the initiates sit across from each other during an exercise to determine their partner's greatest fear. Telepathy should occur; however, after hours of analyzing her partner, Anica, Yennefer has failed to determine her fear and lies to cover up her inadequacies. Tissaia calls Yennefer out for her lie and berates her in front of the class, so Yennefer retreats to Istredd and details her shortcomings. He advises her to keep trying, saying that he didn't give up and now he can read minds. He even helps Yennefer read his mind, revealing glimpses of cicadas, warm bread, and other things that she might enjoy.
The initiates are later taken to Tor Lara to bottle lightning, to test their ability to control the ultimate expression of chaos. On Yennefer's turn, she raises her bottle and fails, causing the lightning to strike her, and send her across the room. Enraged, Yennefer shoots the lightning at Tissaia, who redirects into the sky. Tissaia proceeds to relate to Yennefer, saying there are two types of mages: those who can control their emotions and those who let their emotions control them. Yennefer and Tissaia being the latter.
In her fear of being sent home, Yennefer finds Istredd, who insists that they'll find a way. He can't show Yennefer what he knows because he has to ensure that the knowledge never reaches the Brotherhood. Istredd instead shows her the skulls of the elves who built Aretuza, explaining the Elven history, and how they were the original mages. He gives Yennefer a Feainnewedd, a plant that only grows where Elder Blood has spilt. Using this plant, Yennefer summons a portal with no difficulty and reveals that her real father was a half-elf, and was killed during the Great Cleansing. The half-elf blood caused her to be born with a twisted spine, and she believes that this is why no one could ever love her. Istredd kisses her, as if to prove Yennefer wrong about no one loving her.
Yennefer takes the flower she got from Istredd to Tissaia, as it was a test to see if Yennefer could control her emotions long enough to get it from him. Yennefer asks if this means she's ready to "ascend," and is told to listen for the knock.
Yennefer listens for the knock as instructed. However, it's not her door that Tissaia knocks on. Nevertheless, she takes the opportunity to spy on Tissaia as she turns three of the initiates into eels. Tissaia instructs her to push them into the water. Tissaia took away their control, but they still have power. They're conduits for Aretuza. So when Yennefer takes a broom and pushes them into the water, all of Aretuza lights up with magic.
Ascension to Mage.
It's initiation day at Aretuza, and Yennefer and Istredd are having sex in front of an illusory audience. Afterwards, they share their mutual fears of being separated with Istredd exploring ruins and Yennefer working as a mage to King Virfuril. Yennefer recalls the frightened girl she once was, completely unaware of her power. She wants to go back home to Aedirn and never be that girl again.
Yennefer meets with the enchanter. Every girl he enchants leaves Aretuza a living work of art, no matter how challenging the task. He allows Yennefer to pick a dress, and she chooses the grey one. Tissaia enters and tells Yennefer that they remake themselves on their terms. Yennefer has the power to "free the victim in the mirror" forever. Tissaia instructs Yennefer to close her eyes and imagine the most powerful woman in the world, and takes that image from her mind and transposes it onto the mirror for Yennefer to see.
Later, Yennefer demands an audience with the Chapter after discovering that she is being sent to Nilfgaard rather than Aedirn as promised. Tissaia reveals that it was her blood that finalized the Chapter's decision. Sending a quarter-elf to Aedirn would only further ostracize Cintra given their hatred for elves. It was Stregobor who told the Chapter about Yennifer's true father, and Yennefer realizes that the only way he could've known is if Istredd told him.
Yennefer refuses to attend the initiation. Istredd finds her in the ruins forging her father's name on a deed to declare her as his natural-born daughter. Istredd apologizes for telling Stregobor her secret, so she wants him to go back to the Chapter and tell them that he lied, but it's too late as Yennefer missed initiation and the enchantments are done. Istredd offers to right his wrong, considering that the Brotherhood offered him a seat on the research chapter, so he wishes to bring Yennefer along. However, she wants more than a life "holding dustpans while he brushes bones." Yennefer storms off, but not before Istredd exclaims that she's just angry because she lost her chance to be beautiful. Not only beauty, Yennefer wants power, she admits. She leaves the unfinished deed behind in her angered retreat.
She finds the enchanter and demands that he make her beautiful. Despite not having the necessary herbs to sedate her during the procedure, Yennefer demands that he go through with it. Yennefer removes her clothes and is strapped to a chair. She requests that the enchanter leave her purple eyes and scars. Before proceeding, he informs Yennefer there is a cost to a creation. To be reborn, Yennefer will bear no more. The enchanter surgically removes Yennefer's reproductive organs. He uses them to form a paste that when applied to Yennefer's skin, causes a transformation. Yennefer screams out in pain as internal flames crack her skin. Her body takes shape; her spine forcefully straightens, as does her jaw. The pain is so overwhelming that she breaks free of her chains.
Following a successful enchantment, Yennefer arrives at the Aretuzan ball, catching everyone's eye. Completely reborn, and appearing almost entirely like a new person. She greets the king of Vengerberg, who discards Fringilla in favor of her. The two then dance center floor, and she wins Aedirn as she originally wanted.
Protecting Queen Kalis.
30 years have passed, and Yennefer hasn't aged a day. She travels with Queen Kalis and her newborn child in a carriage guarded by King Virfuril's soldiers. Many fear for Queen Kalis as she has yet to produce a boy to inherit the throne from Virfuril. Kalis envies Yennefer's life as a king's mage. However, Yennefer gave up everything to get her seat at court, and in return, she's spent the last three miserable decades cleaning up political debacles. Nonetheless, Kalis argues that Yennefer made the right choice until the horse carriage suddenly comes under attack. Yennefer and Queen Kalis exit the carriage to find all but one of the guards dead. Standing no more than 50 feet away is an assassin and a koshchey. Yennefer opens a portal for Kalis, her daughter, the guard, and herself to escape through.
They emerge from the portal in a desert, where Yennefer is fairly certain the assassin was paid to kill Queen Kalis as she's repeatedly failed to provide the king a male heir. The assassin then tracks them to the desert, Yennefer and Kalis managing to escape through another portal while the guard is killed in the process. They now arrive in an undetermined town, and Yennefer asks Kalis if she has something of the king's that could be traced. Confirming her suspicion, the assassin tracks and joins them not a second later, his koshchey lunging at Yennefer. She slows it down long enough for Queen Kalis, the child, and herself to escape through another portal to a mountain top, where Yennefer leaves the queen and her child after being tracked for a third time. Each time Yennefer makes a new portal it seems to take more and more effort to create a new one.
Yennefer appears in a field of sunflowers after having left the queen and her child behind. Yennefer eventually returns to find Kalis dead. She kills the koshchey, takes the child, and portals to safety though not before the assassin throws a knife at her as she goes through the portal. Yennefer emerges on a beach and drags herself and the child to shore. The princess doesn't make it due to the knife having grazed Yennefer and the baby, enough to fatally wound the infant. As the sun sets, Yennefer settles on the beach with the princess' infant body by her side. She believes the child is better off dead rather than having to endure the trials and tribulations of life. She then buries the child beneath the sand.
Trapping a Djinn.
Yennefer enters a shop in search of assistance. Much like herself, the owner of the shop, Hemet, is a mage as well, and both have chosen to live a life off the grid, unbounded by the rules of the Brotherhood. She leaves empty-handed after failing to provide enough pay.
Yennefer starts her own business in Rinde; using her magic to fix the problems of the townspeople, so long as they're willing to pay. She has customers lined down the road until she is confronted by the town mayor, Beau Berrant. He's come to collect what's due to the kingdom, but Yennefer ends up arrested when she refuses to comply.
Yennefer receives a visit from Tissaia, who she hasn't seen in years. Not since she maneuvered her way onto Aedirn court over 30 years ago. Tissaia informs Yennefer that King Virfuril is dead, and King Demavend rules now. Yennefer remained hidden for a while, but now she's making noise in search of a solution to her problem; Yennefer wishes to bear children. Tissaia has come to warn her that the mages that Yennefer is enlisting won't help her with her problem because Yennefer is "pure chaos" at the moment. She wants a cure for her infertility, and it's making her sloppy. The Brotherhood left her to her own devices once she abandoned Aedirn, but her recent behavior will make her a target. Tissaia invites Yennefer to return to Aretuza, but she turns Tissaia down. Yennefer suspects that Tissaia only wants to see her thrive so long as she has a hand in it. Tissaia swears this is not true, and she questions what more Yennefer could possibly want, to which she replies "everything."
That night, Yennefer hosts an orgy consisting of several dozen townspeople. To her surprise, the witcher, Geralt of Rivia, interrupts. She knows him as the White Wolf. He requests her help in saving his ally, Jaskier. She questions just how powerful Geralt is, but Jaskier was attacked by a djinn and whatever it did to him is spreading, so Geralt insists on focusing on him. Should Yennefer cure him, Geralt promises to indulge her curiosity. Yennefer agrees to his terms, and states the phrase "ragamuffin," releasing the citizens of Rinde awaken from their trance, completely unaware of their actions.
Yennefer puts Jaskier in a deep healing sleep. He'll be out long enough for Geralt to bathe, and she's even acquired his clothes. As Geralt bathes, she points out that fishing for a djinn is an extreme measure to remedy sleeplessness. Geralt replies that he's desperate. Yennefer undresses and sits back-to-back with Geralt in the bath. She wonders if all witchers are as blessed as he is, being as they're made from magic, mage magic. However, as Geralt explains, it didn't make for a happy childhood. Judging by Yennefer's scars, he can tell she didn't have much of a happy childhood either. He accuses her of capitalizing on the political situation of Rinde, though Yennefer claims that she's serving the stifled townspeople. Ultimately, they both know there's more to the other's claim than they're revealing. Fortunately for Geralt, Yennefer has decided that his company and conversation is payment enough for her services.
While Geralt doesn't doubt her capabilities, he does doubt her intentions. Yennefer assures Geralt that Jaskier will survive and recover his vocal talents. Geralt looks around and realizes that Yennefer is attempting to trap the djinn. She explains that it's tied to this plane and its master. With Jaskier only making two wishes, Yennefer needs him to make his third and final wish so that she can capture the djinn. Geralt is taken over by the sudden smell of lilac and gooseberries. Yennefer kisses him and at that moment has full control of him. She uses him to enact her revenge against a couple of town council members.
As Yennefer prepares the spell, Jaskier awakens. She holds him against the wall and tells him to make a wish. Jaskier makes his final wish, and Yennefer releases him. She then starts chanting to summon the djinn. Geralt returns, offering his help. He tries to stop Yennefer before the power consumes and kills her. Jaskier expressed his last wish, but the djinn only seems to be getting stronger. That's because as Geralt explains, it is he who has the wishes. He refuses to make the last wish in fear that Yennefer becoming a vessel for the djinn would have her lose control. Yennefer states that true transformation is painful and that she'll take the djinn herself. Yennefer becomes unstable. The house itself starts to collapse. In saving Yennefer from herself and her own desires, Geralt makes his final wish to free the djinn. The building then caves in on them.
Yennefer manages to portal herself and Geralt downstairs before the building comes crashing down on them. She blames him for the djinn's escape and all the havoc it will cause. Geralt informs her that djinn are only dark creatures when they're held captive. He's certain that it won't cause much harm now that it's free. Geralt and Yennefer then have sex. Afterwards, Yennefer asks what he wished for, but Geralt does not reveal it. He then sleeps, soundly.
Hunting a Dragon.
Yennefer and her latest companion Eyck of Denesle were among four teams to join in on a hunt to slay a green dragon. Yennefer greeted Geralt and Jaskier for the first time in a year. She couldn't help but wonder why she kept running into Geralt despite walking the earth for decades prior and never meeting a single witcher. She explained that she was there to accompany Eyck as he was to slay the dragon.
All four groups decide to settle down on the mountainside. Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Tèa, Vèa, Yennefer, Eyck, Yarpen, the leader of the dwarves, and Boholt, the leader of the Reavers roasted the hirikka and feasted. However, Borch warned Eyck against eating a certain part of the creature. Another warning that went unconsidered by Eyck. "A great knight never wastes a kill", he replied. It's why he'd make a great lord after slaying the dragon. With Yennefer as his mage. Boholt interrupted and made a lewd remark towards Yennefer. Eyck took his leave as his stomach started to gurgle after failing to heed Borch's warning. They proceeded to discuss how the rightful son of Nilfgaard had returned and started burning through the south. With Fringilla as his mage. Wouldn't be long before they tried to take Sodden.
Yennefer awakened the following morning to find Eyck missing. Yarpen found him dead by a tree with his pants down and throat slit. Nevertheless, the hunt continued. Yarpen suspected that the Reavers killed Eyck, and so he knew of a short cut across the mountains that he only shared with Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Tèa and Vèa. Proposing a truce until they reached the next peak. Geralt tried to convince Yennefer to join them on the shorter path. Much like Yarpen, Yennefer suspected that Boholt killed her escort before he could accomplish the one task she needed him for. Yennefer revealed there are certain healing properties dragons are said to possess. However, Geralt informed her that fertility cures using fresh dragon hearts were a myth. Geralt also didn't believe she'd make a good mother. Yennefer explained that she wanted her choice to bear a child back. Geralt informed her that witchers can't have children either. They were made sterile because their lifestyle weren't suited for a child. He then unintentionally revealed to Yennefer his Child of Surprise.
Yarpen and his men have guided Yennefer, Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Tèa and Vèa to a fairly narrow path lined with wooden boards alongside the mountain. A tight squeeze for anyone larger than that of a dwarf. The board broke beneath Borch's feet and he falls, as does Tèa and Vèa. The only thing preventing them from plummeting to the ground was Geralt holding on to the other end of the chain. Borch told Geralt to let him go. When Geralt refused, Borch let go of the chain, shortly followed by Tèa and Vèa, and the three of them disappeared within the fog as they fell to the ground below.
While in her tent, Yennefer got a visit from Geralt. Yennefer admitted to being worried for Geralt on the mountain. Her scent was mesmerizing. The moment he dreaded most every time she left is when it faded. Yennefer reminded Geralt that it was he who left first in Rinde. She woke up in the destroyed house, and he was gone. Geralt asked for forgiveness and kissed Yennefer. After having sex, Yennefer questioned if the rumors were true about witchers being devoid of human emotion. Geralt explained that was false. People say whatever justified despising his kind. If the choice had been his, Yennefer wondered what Geralt would've been instead of a witcher. Much like Geralt, Yennefer didn't have much of a choice in being a mage. She always dreamed of becoming important to someone someday. Geralt assured Yennefer that she was important to him.
Yennefer woke up the following morning to find Geralt still at her side. At a quick pace, they could make it back to the Pensive Dragon before sundown, however, Yennefer had no intentions of turning around. She was still intent on killing the dragon. She then rushed off to the dragon's cave after noticing the dwarves were already ahead of her.
Yennefer caught up to the dwarves, freezing them in place, allowing for her to pass them by and enter the cave. Once inside, she found the wounded green dragon protecting its egg. Tèa and Vèa appeared and demanded Yennefer stay back. Geralt arrived soon thereafter. The green dragon was dead, but she was not alone. Enter the gold dragon, who revealed itself to be Borch. When the dragoness was injured, her cry was heard by Villentretenmerth. But the egg could not be moved or the life inside it would die, which is why the dragon attacked. She was as protecting her baby. That's when Borch, Tèa and Vèa heard about the king's hunt and realized they had to keep their enemies close. So Borch came to find Geralt, the knight who was taught to save dragons rather than kill them. Boholt and his gang of Reavers arrive, forcing Geralt, Yennefer, Tèa and Vèa to defend the dragons.
Yennefer and Geralt defended one entrance to the cave while Tèa and Vèa defended the other. They are faced with Boholt and one remaining Reaver. Yennefer made sure that it was her who killed Boholt. Afterwards, Borch paid off Yarpen and his men; offering them teeth belonging to the green dragon to take to the king as proof of its demise.
Borch thanked Geralt and Yennefer for all their help in defending him and his family. He noted that he sees why Geralt didn't want to lose her. Yennefer questioned the meaning behind this, and Geralt revealed that he was referring to Rinde and their encounter with the djinn. That was why they couldn't escape each other. Because Geralt wished for it. Yennefer took that to mean that her feelings for Geralt were also magic, though he insisted that wasn't true. An argument ensued, resulting in the two parting ways. Borch saved them both a lot of hurt with a little pain now. He revealed that Yennefer would never regain her womb, and Geralt would lose Yennefer.
Returning to Aretuza.
Coming from Caingorn, Yennefer arrived in Nazair, a Nilfgaard ran excavation site, where she reunited with Istredd after years apart. Why they're digging? The tunes described a "magnalith" in Nazair, but no one could find it until Istredd arrived and Nilfgaard tore through the lands. They allowed his research. Every glyph had a clue to something across the continent from a time before the Conjunction. Yennefer took a sip of the ale, which she described as having a terrible taste. However, Istredd claimed that the people of Nazair were starving before Nilfgaard's arrival. Yennefer surmised that Istredd "bought in."
She questioned how much longer Istredd intended to stay in Nazair as she missed him. Yennefer asked if it wasn't too late to do what they always talked about all those years ago in the cave of Aretuza. Living a life together. Istredd could excavate as she worked as a mage. He recalled how Yennefer always hated monoliths. Admittedly this was true, but Yennefer had spent decades being the object of desire, having anyone she wanted. But they all loved the power that came with her position at court. Not her actual power. And no one had ever seen that but Istredd. Yennefer kissed him. However, he pulled away. He spent years waiting for the moment that Yennefer realized that they were meant for each other. Coming up with excuses to study at Aedirn. Anything to get closer to her, but every request he made was denied by her. It was Stregobor who snapped him out of it. He reminded Istredd of the beauty of their work. Yennefer went after the thing she loved, so she chose power. At least she kept her eyes, he remarked, before departing.
Yennefer was then approached by Vilgefortz of Roggeveen, who was in need of her help. Nilfgaard had been conscripting mages into their service. And since neither of them possessed a legitimate letter of safe conduct, they both should leave as fast as possible. He needed Yennefer to accompany him back to Aretuza. He and Tissaia needed her help. Tissaia even said herself that Yennefer was the best student she'd ever taught.
Yennefer accompanied him back to Aretuza, where he and Vanielle of Brugge informed her that Nilfgaard was planning to attack Cintra. Not that Yennefer cared. She only cared for finding Tissaia. To her surprise, Tissaia had no idea she was in Aretuza. Vilgefortz lied to Yennefer in hopes of convincing her to join their cause.
Yennefer returned to her old room to find three initiates, Fola, Glacella, and Murta playing around, claiming to be studying botany. They questioned why she's back. A question that not even Yennefer at the time could answer. She offered to show them what the herbs used in botany were truly good for. While the herbs possessed certain healing properties, when mixed, they act as psychedelics. From the girls, Yennefer discovered that Glacella never had a "conduit moment" and that certain initiates were buying their way into the Aretuza.
Yennefer showed the girls a more terrifying fate than being expelled should they get caught. She took them to Aretuza's windmill, where many years prior, she watched Tissaia turn her friends into eels. Yennefer informed the girls that the ability to create life would be taken from them so that when they were sent out into the world, the only family and loyalty they'd have was to Aretuza. Initiates like Glacella, "with all the magical talent of shoe leather," would end up in the water with the rest of Yennefer's sisters who never ascended. Tissaia interrupted Yennefer's schooling of the girls and sent them to their rooms. She went on to tell Yennefer that she should stop with the one life she'd already ruined, that being her own.
Yennefer never wanted to come back, referring to Aretuza as a joke, letting in girls who couldn't even do magic. Tissaia explained that they had to make compromises in order to survive. Tissaia departed after noticing a gathering of the mages, leaving Yennefer clueless. Fortunately, she found Triss Merigold, who told her that an emergency conclave of the Northern Mages was called after Nilfgaard took Marnadal.
Artorius, Stregobor, and Tissaia led the conclave. Artorius and Stregobor had no desire to go to war with Nilfgaard, especially not for Cintra, who rejected their mages for decades. However, Vilgefortz worried that more kingdoms would fall after Cintra as Nilfgaard wanted the entire continent. Rather than watching them fall, Tissaia wanted to help Cintra defeat Nilfgaard. Sabrina, Vilgefortz, and Vanielle sided with Tissaia, wanting to convince the kings to send their armies because if they didn't stop Nilfgaard now, more kingdoms would fall.
Fringilla arrived at the conclave and denounced any suspicion that Nilfgaard was planning to take over the continent. Under their new leader, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, Nilfgaard had strengthened trade and funded research. Fringilla believed that in taking Cintra, they had a chance of saving the continent. If the Northern mages wouldn't take sides, Fringilla asked that they at least stay out of her way. Fringilla then pointed out that if not for Yennefer, she never would've been assigned to Nilfgaard, and it wouldn't be the empire it is today. Artorius joked that had they sent Yennefer to Nilfgaard as planned, it would still be a "shitty backwater." Yennefer admitted this was true. Instead of Nilfgaard, she went to a prized kingdom and did "fuck all for decades." She helped murderers and rapists keep their crown. If given an option, she'd vote to burn it all down. The mages put it to a vote. Unfortunately, most sided with Stregobor and Artorius to allow Cintra to fend for themselves.
Once the conclave concluded, Yennefer and Tissaia resumed their previous discussion. Tissaia insisted that there are girls who need the help that only Aretuza can provide. She also added that Yennefer was right, back in Rinde when Tissaia visited her. But now, they may have to put their differences aside to stop Nilfgaard. Tissaia, Vilgefortz, and some of the other mages planned to fight, and she was hoping Yennefer would join them.
Battle of Sodden Hill.
Approximately 60 mages, Yennefer, Tissaia, Triss, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Sabrina included, boarded a ship headed for Sodden Hill. They needed to get to the Elven keep that guarded it before Nilfgaard did. They had already sent word to the Northern kingdoms. Temeria and Kaedwen agreed to join them in defending the land. The plan was to protect the keep. Once on land, Yennefer questioned Nilfgaard's strategy of sacking Cintra and exposing themselves. Vilgefortz explained that the bigger picture was often left for history. Their task was much clearer - hold Sodden and save the continent.
Yennefer, Tissaia, Triss, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Sabrina arrived at the keep, the only thing separating Nilfgaard from the North. They were greeted by a man. Yennefer advised him to take the children and hide, but as he explained, there was no more hiding from Nilfgaard. Their only chance was to fight.
Yennefer recalled Triss spending time in Temeria and asked if she truly believed that King Foltest would bring the Northern armies. Triss trusted that he would come through after she and Geralt helped save his daughter, who was cursed as a striga. Yennefer then sat with Tissaia and discussed Nilfgaard's encroachment and the need to enjoy the night while they could. Yennefer noticed that Tissaia had taken a liking to Vilgefortz. Tissaia looked to her and asked if she was ready to die should they fail to stop Nilfgaard. Yennefer claimed that she was, having lived several lifetimes, none of which satisfied her, Tissaia remarked. Yennefer had accepted that life had no more to give. However, Tissaia argued that Yennefer still had more to give.
Yennefer awakened to find a fireball fired by Nilfgaard coming straight for her. She halted the fireball mid-air and then redirected it. The sun had risen and the Northern mages made it through the night. Unfortunately, Nilfgaard arrived much sooner than they anticipated and the Northern armies were still a ways out. There were only 22 of them left, Yennefer, Tissaia, Triss, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, Atlan Kerk, and Sabrina included. They watched as a thick fog consumed the mountains around them, signalling Nilfgaard's encroachment. Tissaia ordered Sabrina to take the villagers to the artillery room while she and Triss head down. Yennefer was instructed to keep watch on the tower and reserve her chaos.
Yennefer watched from the tower as Nilfgaard's army approached. She telepathically communicated with the others to alert them and order them to make their move. On Yennefer's command, Vilgefortz portalled to Cahir's destination, taking out half a dozen soldiers before getting to Cahir. During the fight, Vilgefortz was disarmed multiple times, each time using magic to return his sword, despite Yennefer's warnings to reserve his chaos. Vilgefortz was bested by Cahir and with his chaos depleted, Cahir kicks him off the hill. Cahir rolls down the hill and hits his head on a tree stump.
Yennefer watched from the tower as Nilfgaard broke through their forces. She telepathically guided Coral back to the keep. After watching Atlan get struck down by an arrow, Coral decided to stop running. She tried to perform a spell but was killed before she can. Atlan was killed as well.
Sabrina sneaked up behind Yennefer and stabbed her in the abdomen with an arrow after being infected by a parasite. Two young boys, also under the control of the parasites, took their bottles of blue meteorite and dropped them on the table filled with blue meteorite, causing a massive explosion on both ends of the keep that sent Yennefer and Sabrina flying off the tower, though the former managed to stick the landing. The fall appeared to return Sabrina to her normal self as she apologized for attacking Yennefer.
Yennefer limped out of the keep, forced to witness the massacre that had unfolded as villagers of all ages lay dead on the grounds of Sodden Hill. She telepathically called out to her fellow mages without response, telling them to hold the front line as more Nilfgaardians approached. Although Triss seemed to survive the initial attack, she was still too wounded to battle. Yennefer killed two of them as they were tying an arm-less Coral to a tree. Fringilla intercepted Yennefer's message. She told Yennefer to stop fighting and join Nilfgaard. However, Yennefer stayed true to her belief.
Yennefer found Tissaia on the hillside. Tissaia had been severely weakened, but with the Northern armies close, Yennefer refused to give up. She looked Tissaia in the eyes and for the first time, admitted that Tissaia saved her. It was now Yennefer's turn to save the continent. Tissaia urged her to let her chaos explode. Yennefer got back to her feet, absorbed the fire that was consuming the keep and unleashed it all on the Nilfgaard army.
Prisoner of War.
Yennefer awakened under a tree, shackled and held prisoner by Fringilla and what remained of her Nilfgaard army. Yennefer came to the realization that they won and that Fringilla and Nilfgaard were on the run, however, Fringilla informed her that Sodden was only one of many battles to come. Yennefer couldn't imagine that her leader, the White Flame, would be too pleased to see her return defeated, which is why she intended to offer Yennefer up as a sacrifice.
Yennefer tried to convince Fringilla to let her go, as neither of them were certain that her sacrifice would spare Fringilla of her failure. She even offered Fringilla a chance to join them and redeem herself. However, Fringilla insisted that what she was doing was in the name of liberation, which was the opposite of what they were taught at Aretuza. There, they were just sent out as pawns to guild kingdoms, nothing more. Yennefer accused Fringilla of being unable to think for himself, to which Fringilla replied that Yennefer was blind.
As Fringilla and Nilfgaard prepared to pack up camp, her men were attacked by spears until only Yennefer and Fringilla were left standing.
Captured by Elves.
Yennefer dreamt of her and Geralt living happily together, with a baby on the way and the promise to grow old together. However, her dream turned into a nightmare when her baby's basket burst into flames and a hooded figure with a red cloak was holding the child. Yennefer awakened from her sleep to discover that she and Fringilla had been taken prisoner by Filavandrel and his elven army.
Yennfer and Fringilla were taken to the elves new leader, Francesca, who mentioned dreaming of someone in a white robe and questioned why Filavandrel hadn't had them killed yet. It was then that Yennfer revealed she's part elf. However, Francesca wasn't moved, as Yennefer's never even sung a song or honored their elders.
Yennefer noticed earlier that Fringilla was having a nightmare and asked what it was about, possibly someone hidden in a robe. A black robe, Fringilla confirmed, whereas Yennefer has dreamt of one in red while Francesca dreamed of one in white, which they revealed to Filavandrel before being taken to a temple where runes of the Conjunction of the Spheres had been inscribed along the walls. Francesca revealed that the guide in her dream was Ithlinne, whereas Fringilla's was Emhyr. Yennefer then brushed away the dust on the altar to discover Elder speech. "Behold the mother of forests, the deathless mother, nesting in dreams." What remains was an incantation about a hut with no doors. Suddenly, the altar slid open and revealed a passageway, which Yennefer, Fringilla, and Francesca followed.
Yennefer, Fringilla, and Francesca found the doorless hut in the woods and recited the incantation, causing the hut to turn in their direction and summon them inside, where Yennefer was approached by the Deathless Mother disguised as a little girl. The Deathless Mother made Fringilla and Francesca a proposition to gain power and rebuild the elven community respectively but left Yennefer to suffer a bit longer after she lost her Chaos due to using fire magic at the Battle of Sodden Hill.
Yennefer awakened in the woods, where she regrouped with Fringilla, who revealed that they're no longer prisoners and that she joined forces with Francesca, who claimed that the old gods wanted an alliance between the elves and Nilfgaard. Yennefer called them both fools and part ways, unable to even make a portal to send herself home.
Return to Aretuza.
Yennefer returned to Aretuza despite the rumors of her death. She was welcomed back by Tissaia, who admitted that while Yennefer's actions turned the tide at the battle and that she was a hero, they need to allow Vilgefortz to carry the mantle of victory for now because he and Tissaia were making a play for their council seats.
Yennefer attempted to warm up the water at Aretuza but failed miserably. She was joined Triss and Sabrina, who decided to go for a swim, but Triss wasn't comfortable showing her burn wounds and simply watched them from the edge. Triss recalled the Battle at Sodden. After she'd been burned by a soldier, she was on the ground screaming, and Yennefer walked by her. They were all there to play a part, and she remembers thinking that if only one of them gets to live, she was glad it was Yennefer, who offered to find a cure for Triss' scares, but she didn't appear too concerned, telling Yennefer, "What's lost is lost." She was simply glad not to be on Tissaia's plaque.
After crossing paths with Vilgefortz, Yennefer discovered Cahir in his cell. She told him that he wouldn't meet his end by their hands, as death must serve a purpose, and his would serve none. Fringilla told Cahir about Yennefer, that how she envied her during their days as schoolmates. Yennefer herself was then placed in a cell and bound to a chair by Stregobor, who didn't trust her considering she had elven blood and mysteriously went missing for a month after the battle. When she admitted to being a prisoner of war and having been taken by Nilfgaard, he decided to dig further through her mind for answers, but Tissaia intervened and warned Stregobor that he would answer for this.
In order to prove her innocence, Yennfer had to kill Cahir. It would prove that she was not a spy, but she believed it would only prove she was a killer, which was just another way for Stregobor to vilify her. If she wouldn't kill him, Tissaia instructed Yennefer to tell them the truth — that she was not a threat because she lost her magic. For a month, Yennefer searched the Continent, trying every herb, potion, and spell to get back what she deserves. She looked to Tissaia for help, but all she could say was that "What is lost, is lost." But Yennefer refused to just give up.
Yennefer planned to flee Aretuza, but Istredd caught her and said that she could trust him if she had an ulterior motive. He lied to the council earlier; he spent time amongst Nilfgaard's followers and heard how they felt protected and welcomed under the emperor, which he hadn't told anyone else. Istredd was leaving for Cintra tomorrow to help the elves who were migrating and warns her that Stregobor has spies stationed on the tower. She would be caught if she tried to slip out.
Yennefer and Cahir walked side by side to his execution. She explained that his death would now serve as her absolution. However, rather than cutting off his head, she cut him free of his chains and helped him escape.
Fleeing Oxenfurt with Cahir.
Yennefer and Cahir were on the run in Oxenfurt, where Yennefer revealed that Nilfgaard had forged an alliance with the elves and that Fringilla had claimed leadership. They were forced to go into hiding when wanted posters for their arrest were released to the public. They headed down into the sewers after being attacked by a guard, where they met Dermain and Ba'lian, who told them about the Sandpiper, who helped elves get passage to Xin'trea. However, on their journey to the Sandpiper, Dermain was killed by some kind of tentacled creature whilst Ba'lian fled. Yennefer was then snatched, but Cahir managed to pull her to safety.
They made their way back to surface level, where he realized that Yennefer lost her powers that day on the battlefield in Sodden. He believed that maybe Yennefer had a bigger purpose. He and Fringilla served the White Flame because he served them first. Everyone answers to someone eventually. Yennefer and Cahir then spot Ba'lian creeping into a tavern through the back entrance and join him. The elves explained that they have to wait for the tavern to empty, then the piper will take them to the boat. As it turns out, the Sandpiper is Jaskier, who performed at the tavern every night.
The following morning, Yennefer reunited with Jaskier and embraced him with a hug. She heard his song and suspected that he and Geralt must've ended on bad terms, which he admitted was true. She then revealed that she was in hiding. Jaskier informed her that there were anonymous benefactors working behind the scenes to help him save the elves.
Jaskier distracted the guards so that the others could sneak aboard the ship. Once inside, Jaskier asked what happened to Yennefer, and she revealed that she lost her magic, which Jaskier was sympathetic to, because like her, he was scared that one day the muses would stop speaking to him, because who are they when they can no longer do the one thing they were put on the Continent to do. Yennefer replied that they have to find a new purpose. Jaskier told Yennefer goodbye and wished her good luck. However, as soon as Jaskier left, Yennefer heard him scream and went to investigate, only to find his lute laying on the ground.
Rescuing Jaskier.
Yennefer approached a whore and asked if she would like to make some money on her feet instead of on her back. She feared that Jaskier might have gotten into some trouble at the docks and asked the lady to go to the garrison and see if he's been caged.
Yennefer watched helplessly as guards from the Northern Kingdom took a daughter away from her mother. She tried to use magic to help, but without access to Chaos, she was powerless. The lady whom she employed to check out the garrison returned and informed Yennefer that no one by the name of Jaskier was there. However, she told Yennefer to check the taverns. From experience, when she lost a man, he was usually at the first place she found him.
Yennfer posed as Jaskier's drunken wife and stumbled into the bar to find him being tortured by Rience. With a mouthful of alcohol, Yennefer waited until Rience conjured fire before spitting the alcohol out and engulfing his face in fire, allowing her and Jaskier to escape.
After gaining a safe distance, Jaskier revealed to Yennefer that Rience was after Geralt and advised her to warn him, but without magic, she couldn't. They were then approached by three men. Yennefer kicked one in between his legs, and she and Jaskier split up. The lady from before offered Yennefer shelter in her whorehouse, but unbeknownst to Yennefer, Redanian guards awaited inside to apprehend her.
While restrained to a chair, Yennefer could hear the Deathless Mother speaking to her, informing her how Fringilla and Francesca were thriving. All she had to do to get her magic back was say the incantation, which she did and portalled away to the Deathless Mother's hut. There, she explained that didn't grant wishes. She was merely a guide to get Yennefer what she wanted. Yennefer exclaimed that she deserves access to Chaos. The Deathless Mother revealed that Ciri was the key to Yennefer getting her power back. All she had to do was deliver her to a shattered black door just outside Cintra.
A Deal with the Deathless Mother.
Yennefer tracked Ciri down to Melitele's Temple, where she spotted Ciri before unexpectedly reuniting with Geralt, who the latter thought she was dead. It was from him that she learned Ciri was his Child Surprise. After getting to know Ciri a bit, Yennefer and Geralt caught up over lost time, with Yennefer claiming that she was staying at the temple to hide out from the Brotherhood. Yennefer questioned what changed his mind about claiming his Child Surprise. Many things changed his mind, one of which being Yennefer. She then revealed that she ran into Jaskier in Oxenfurt. He was in some kind of trouble with a mage using fire magic who was looking for Geralt and Ciri.
Yennefer and Geralt came to Ciri's aid upon learning the temple was under attack by Rience and the Michelet brothers. Geralt slaughtered the intruders, whilst Yennefer and Ciri locked themselves in a room. With Rience on the other side of the door trying to melt it open, the Orbuculum sensed Ciri's magic and began to glow. Yennefer taught Ciri how to create a portal, which they escape through. Geralt called out to Yennefer just as she was fleeing and told her to stop, but she replied that she couldn't.
Yennefer and Ciri portalled not too far from Cintra. In fact, they were at the same house where Ciri had her first dream about Yennefer. In one of the rooms, they discovered the charred remains of the people who helped Ciri and gave her shelter. Ciri partially blames herself for their death before coming to the conclusion that Rience could possibly work for Nilfgaard and maybe took Geralt to their nearest outpost, that being Cintra, which they decided to travel to together.
Yennefer and Ciri reached the river, but the bridge had broken. For lesson number two, Yennefer taught Ciri to use her Chaos to repair the bridge, a task she struggled with, so much so that blood dripped from her eyes until Yennefer forced her to stop. Frustrated, Ciri screamed so intensely that she teleported Yennefer, herself, as well as the horses to the other side of the bridge. Yennefer wiped her face and told Ciri to never apologize for her power.
They arrived at the site of the monolith collapse, just outside Cintra. If they ever get separated, Yennefer reminded Ciri to remember that magic was all she had and that it was a part of her. As they got closer to the shattered black door, Yennefer hears Voleth Meir speaking saying that it is nearby, and Ciri touched it and discovered his true intentions. Yennefer told her to turn back if she was afraid. Yennefer tries to apologize for betraying Ciri, because she did not know before who she was and what she was to Geralt, and informed her that Geralt wasn't at Cintra, leading Ciri to suspect that the mage at the temple knew Yennefer and that she'd been conspiring with him the entire time, but she says that's not true. Upset by her betrayal, Ciri's powers manifested and emitted a rippling effect, cracking the ground and nearby Cintran kingdom, occupied by Nilfgaard.
The guards came charging towards Ciri and Yennefer, who are saved by Geralt. He then drew his blade on Yennefer, who apologized for her betrayal, but he wasn't convinced. Geralt stayed behind and revealed his plans to kill the Deathless Mother whilst Jaskier took Ciri back to Kaer Morhen. With the blade to her neck, Yennefer recited the incantation, but when they arrive at her hut, they discovered that she'd escaped.
The Ultimate Sacrifice.
Yennefer followed Geralt to Kaer Morhen, where she revealed that Voleth Meir had visited to her as a little girl. She fed on pain, but she was more specific than that. She found her weakness, the gaping wound in her heart, the thing that made her feel hopeless, and she plunged her finger into it, and made it hurt so badly Yennefer do anything to make it stop, like sacrifice a child, but Yennefer didn't go through with it, as she understood how special Ciri was. She radiated the spark that Yennefer used to feel when she used her Chaos.
Yennefer and Geralt enter the den to discover that Ciri had been possessed by the Deathless Mother and that she had killed some of the witchers in their sleep.
Yennefer awakened Jaskier from his sleep and brought him to the lab, where she attempted to make a potion that would remove Voleth Meir from Ciri without killing her. Fortunately, she found active jasper, which was a provider of warmth, energy, and balance. Yennefer pulled Ciri into this mess and would do anything she could to get her out of it. So, she tasked to give Geralt the jasper, as it would help turn wrongs into rights.
Yennefer joined the fight against the Deathless Mother alongside Geralt, who realized that without her hut, the Deathless Mother needed a vessel to exist within their sphere, meaning Ciri couldn't escape. So, Yennefer slit both her wrists open and summoned Voleth Meir.
When Ciri awakened, she portalled herself, Yennefer, and Geralt to Voleth Meir's home sphere, where she exited Yennefer's body and joined the ranks of the Wild Hunt. When Ciri portals them back home, Yennefer revealed that she was whole again. She felt it come back when she sacrificed herself for Ciri. While Geralt didn't forgive her, he wanted Yennefer to join them and use her knowledge of magic to help train Ciri, as she's the only person who's helped her control her power. Geralt recalled Vilentretenmerth saying they are made for each other, destined for each other, but that nothing would come of it because destiny alone wasn't sufficient. Something more was needed. Geralt believed that Ciri was that something more. He and Yennefer then join Ciri on the bridge and assure her that they'll see her along the way of her destiny.
Shelter.
Yennefer, Geralt and Ciri left Kaer Morhen to go in search of shelter, avoid the people who are looking for Ciri. She begins to teach her to use his powers, while talking to Geralt in letters, since they have not yet reconciled. After six months, arrive settle down in a home provided by Yarpen and to spend the winter. Yennefer learns to ice skate with Ciri, while they are watched by Geralt. In the same cabin they have dinner together as a family, Ciri helps her prepare dinner and clean up. After many magic lessons, Yennefer talks to Ciri about fire magic, it is forbidden and consumes her entire soul, taking away all her magic. That night, the three attend the Belleteyn festival, Yennefer wearing a black dress and Geralt telling her that she looks beautiful. In the valley, Geralt tells him happy birthday, and the two begin to talk and remember their beautiful nights they had together, after the Djinn. In the labyrinth, Ciri is attacked by a jackapace, sent by Rience using his blood to track her and find her, Yennefer and Geralt came and saved her. Then, the trio make a plan to bring Rience and kill him, with the help of Yarpen and Jackier. 
Fight at Shaerrawedd.
They arrive at the ruins of Shaerrawedd, where they speak of a brave elf warrior, named Aelirenn. The next day, Ciri shares with Yennefer and Geralt about another dream she had. She explains that being both elf and human, she wants to find a way to unite both races and end the destruction. In the middle of the talk, danger is felt nearby, and Rience and his men appear. Rience escapes through a portal, which Yennefer holds open for Geralt to enter. In the middle of the fight, Francesca and the elves also arrive to take Ciri. While holding the portal open, Francesca approaches Yennefer, believing herself to be an elf, telling her that Ciri has Elder Blood, but Yennefer refuses to listen to her and pushes her away.
After the fight, Yennefer suspects that there is a mage supporting Rience. She decides to take Ciri to Aretuza to receive training from Tissaia and be safe, so Yennefer, Ciri and Geralt must separate. Before leaving, Yennefer promises Geralt to take care of her, that there will be more nice nights and Geralt will think of her.
Journey to Aretuza.
On her trip to Aretuza, Yennefer explains to Ciri that Aretuza will help her focus her visions of the future. In a small store, he asks a friend of his, Keira Metz, for help in opening a portal to Aretuza. In the middle of this, a man enters with a child pulling him on a leash, demanding to open a portal to Claremont. Seeing in a vision of the boy's horrible death, Ciri had no choice but to free him, causing the bandit to try to attack her and Yennefer was forced to kill him by the neck. Before fleeing, Keira warns that it is dangerous to mess with Houvenaghel's men. That night, Yennefer is disappointed in Ciri, since they had to avoid attracting attention. Sometimes discretion is more important than courage. Yennefer decides to show Ciri her past and who she really was. They arrive at the place where Yennefer's old childhood home was, she shows Ciri her past, how she was deformed, her life on a farm, abused by her stepfather and how he sold her to Tissaia. She confesses that she was not always perfect, and she is not sure that she will be received well after having committed an act of betrayal by freeing Cahir.
Continuing the journey to Aretuza, Yennefer takes Ciri to the Gors Velen market to the dwarf bank, there she meets Giancardi. She asks for a vault and someone to accompany Ciri, Yennefer puts a cloak on her, disguising her and taking away her sword, tells her to just be a normal citizen, buy something without worrying about it, uses a tracking spell on Ciri's necklace so that she can use it and call her if she has a problem. While Ciri is strolling through the market, Yennefer meets with Tissaia, seeing that she knew before that Cirilla was alive and that she told the kings of the north to gain their favor, since she was believed dead after the massacre of Cintra. Everyone in the north searches for the princess of Cintra, although they do not realize that the Nilfgaardian Empire plans to destroy them. Tissaia says that gaining their favor is no more insulting than freeing a Nilfgaardian prisoner. Yennefer regrets having made so much trouble. She tells him about Rience and that there is a powerful mage supporting him to find Ciri, she asks for his help to protect and train her. In the middle of the talk, Tissaia saw that after everything that has happened, Yennefer has become a mother.
Later, after Ciri caused trouble again by freeing a young wyvern, Yennefer stops Sabrina and Margarita who wanted to punish her, she explains the situation and invites them to the Silver Heron. Enjoying themselves inside, Sabrina and Margarita start talking and how Yennefer is liking a witcher. Rita begins to complain about Ciri serving the wine, causing Ciri to scold her. Yennefer takes her and criticizes her for her bad answers, she tells her that she is not a princess here, she is a novice. Ciri, however, does not want to accept this after hearing that there they turn those who do not advance into eagles, but Yennefer tells her that she wants to implore the Brotherhood to forgive her, and that Aretuza is the best option to be safe from the who try to hunt her down. She tells her that Yennefer doesn't owe Tissaia the rest of her life just because she saved her, and Yennefer says that if she wants to be a leader and change the world, she must first get over all of this. She is not Geralt and this is not Kaer Morhen. Back on the Silver Heron, Tiassia stands by her side, Yennefer says that war is coming and Ciri is in the center, she proposes that they hold a conclave in the hopes of uniting everyone in the north.
Invitations.
In Aretuza, Yennefer called a meeting of mages, to make preparations for the conclave, in the hopes of joining forces with Redania. Tissasia and the rest agree, but Stregobor objects to this. Sending out invitations to the conclave, Yennefer notices a bracelet Tissaia has, she says it is a gift from Vilgefortz. Then, Yennefer wonders what happened between her and Philipa, the two were very close, Tissaia simply says that the friendship just ended, so Yennefer also says to invite her. Triss arrives and interrupts them, saying that some novices have disappeared. Yennefer talks to Triss, saying that Geralt will bring Ciri, he told her everything that happened in Kaer Morhen, she thanks him for helping Ciri.

Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, or better known as Ciri (b. 1250), was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.
After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt proclaimed the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny.
Biography.
Early Life.
Shortly after Ciri was born to Pavetta and Duny, they learned of Ithlinne's Prophecy and that it referred to their newborn daughter. Realizing that people would try to kill Ciri if they began to believe the prophecy, Duny urged Pavetta that the young family should leave that night on a waiting ship. However, things went wrong and Duny and Pavetta died that night. After the death of her parents, Ciri was raised by her grandmother Calanthe.
Massacre of Cintra.
Many years later, dressed up as a regular citizen, Ciri was playing a game of knucklebones in the streets with other children when the princess' stand-in rushed over to say goodbye to the group, including the young princess, before heading off. As Ciri went back to the game, she lost her focus, feeling someone was watching her, but when she looked over, nobody was there. After she failed to win, one of the knights, Lazlo, arrived to take her back to the castle to attend a knight induction ceremony headed by her grandmother and grandfather, Queen Calanthe and King Eist.
"Did you win this time? Like I showed you.""I would have, if the horsemen of doom hadn't ridden up like that.""If you can't win a game of knucklebones for fear of a few horses, what'll you do when you go into battle?"- Eist and Ciri,  "The End's Beginning"
Afterwards, the family attended a celebratory feast where Calanthe, Eist, and Mousesack, a close advisor and druid, discussed the encroachment of Nilfgaard. Overhearing this, Ciri inquired what they were talking about and while her grandmother tried to hide the truth, Eist immediately revealed there was a war going on. Calanthe then gave Ciri advice regarding a fight, before they were interrupted by a nobleman and his young son, Martin, who asked to dance with Ciri. As Ciri started to say no, Calanthe butted in saying Ciri would love to, making Ciri get up to go dance with him.
Two days later, Ciri, having been locked away in the castle with Mousesack and Lazlo as her grandparents were off fighting the Nilfgaardian invaders, had grown agitated and Mousesack gave her a very short story regarding the curse of the Black Sun in which young girls were locked away in towers and systematically killed to prevent a prophecy of them causing the end of the human race from happening. She then asked Mousesack if her grandmother would be alright but he dodged the question, instead responding that she, Ciri, will be alright.
Shortly after, a badly injured Calanthe returns from the lost battle, in which Eist was also summarily killed. Calanthe tried to reassure her granddaughter everything would be fine as Nilfgaard invades the city before sending her away so the queen can rest. Ciri then found Mousesack as he created a magical barrier around the keep, though he remarked it'll only hold as long as he holds. By nightfall, the barrier finally fails and Nilfgaard breaches the keep.
"In the face of the inevitable, Cirilla, good leaders should always choose mercy. In the future, you will be wise to do the same."- Calanthe to Ciri,  "The End's Beginning"
Back in her grandmother's chambers, Ciri watched Calanthe give orders to her men before calling Ciri over and gives her her second lesson in war, revealing Nilfgaard brutally slaughters and tortures and doesn't take prisoners. Mousesack then returned, mentioning "he's gone". At this news, Calanthe called for Lazlo to get the princess to safety, but not wanting to leave, Ciri screams, unintentionally releasing a magical pulse that rattled nearby glasses. The queen then tells the young princess she needs to find Geralt of Rivia as he's her destiny, and this time a reluctant Ciri leaves.
Lazlo and Mousesack then escort Ciri through the underground tunnels but are discovered by a group of Nilfgaardian soldiers as they exit the keep. Mousesack stays behind to fend them off, allowing Lazlo and Ciri to flee on horseback, but the pair are quickly set on by another Nilfgaardian, Cahir, who shoots and kills Lazlo, knocking the knight's body, along with Ciri, off their horse. Cahir then takes Ciri and escapes with her but as he races outside the city, Ciri, seeing Cintra burning, screams, releasing yet another powerful magical pulse that scares Cahir's horse, knocking them both to the ground. As Cahir tries to grab her again, Ciri releases several more screams, each time getting more and more powerful, preventing Cahir from getting her as she puts more distance between them. After one such scream, a nearby stone monolith collapses and causes the ground to split and create a chasm between the two, allowing Ciri to escape.
Evading Nilfgaard's Soldiers.
Three days after the attack on Cintra, Ciri finds herself traveling alone through the woods and having to hide as Nilfgaardian soldiers are trying to find her so, in an attempt to further obscure her appearance, she uses mud to darken her hair. As she continues to travel, she spots some berries and tries to pick them but something is thrown at her hand, stopping her from doing so, and she soon spots the perpetrator: a young man hiding nearby who signals the berries are poisonous before gesturing for her to come to him. On joining him, he motions at a rat running around as food, but she declines. However, the boy isn't as picky of an eater and the two set up a small campfire where he cooks the rat and eats it while Ciri asks him questions, though the boy still doesn't say a word. He then offers her the cooked rat again and this time she accepts it before the two set out once more. As they travel silently together, Ciri sees her new companion's hands are cold and gives him one of her gloves to help. Right after though she spots a nearby Cintran refugee camp and runs over to it, but when she turns around "rat boy" is gone, having disappeared back into the forest.
As Ciri makes her way through the camp, she unintentionally cuts into a soup line and quickly learns not everyone has such a great outlook on her grandmother, blaming her for failing to save Cintra. Another bystander notices her cloak, informing her he recognizes it as one his father had made for Cintra's finest. As Ciri follows him, the young man, Adon, realizes she's staring at his "necklace": a collection of elf ears, for each one he killed for revenge over Filavandrel aén Fidháil's uprising that caused his brother's death. He then leads Ciri off to a nearby tent to meet all that remains of his family: his mother, Lilja, and a brother, Zeke. Realizing it's best to hide her real identity, Ciri introduces herself as "Fiona" while the boy's relatives show differing views on the elves and Calanthe. On noticing Ciri's worn out shoes, Lilja then offers to replace them, but when Ciri accepts, it turned out she meant for their halfling slave, Abbott, to give up his shoes to replace Ciri's, which Ciri accepts from him, though rather reluctantly.
At night, as they all lay in bed, Lilja tries to tell Ciri she's safe but when Ciri asks if the widow knows Geralt of Rivia, she unfortunately doesn't know who he is. Lilja then asks about Ciri's family, to which Ciri responds that her parents died years ago and her grandmother died in the attack, before apologizing for what happened to the widow's family. Lilja then affirms they'll all make it out together. However, later that night Nilfgaardians attack the camp and the mother angrily orders Abbott around but when he doesn't catch a bag thrown at him, she physically and verbally abuses him, to which he snaps and starts to stab her to death as Ciri backs up into a corner. Someone then cuts into the tent's fabric right next to Ciri and pulls her through, only for Ciri to see it's rat boy rescuing her. She proceeds to follow him to get out of the camp while it's being attacked, though she stops briefly when she finds a dead Adon. As she mourns him, she sees Cahir nearby and quickly puts her hood up before taking off once more with rat boy into the woods to escape.
The following morning, as Ciri and her companion drink from a stream, she looks up to see he's removed his hat for once, revealing elf ears. While they're both initially startled at her discovering he's an elf, Ciri thanks him for everything he's done in helping her and he finally speaks to her for the first time, introducing himself as Dara.
Entering Brokilon Forest.
An unknown time later, Ciri wakes up from where the two fell asleep in the forest, initially startled. However, she quickly falls under a trance and calmly begins to make her way through a clearing to the forest on the other side, not even noticing all the human skeletons in the clearing or Dara chasing after her, screaming her name before he's subsequently shot in the shoulder by an unknown assailant.
As Ciri continues to follow the whispering voices she's hearing, she enters a part of the forest that appears more like a lush jungle than the barren, snow-covered forest she came from before suddenly snapping out of her reverie just in time to be surrounded by armed dryads. Their general only speaks in Elder Speech though to Ciri, who tries to plead for mercy, having gotten lost and not sure how she ended up there in the first place. The dryad's queen, Eithné, approaches and, in Ciri's own language, asks for her name, to which the princess once again gives the alias "Fiona". Still having no clue where she is though, Ciri asks, only to find out she wandered into the sacred Brokilon Forest, before the queen has Ciri follow her.
As they head deeper into the forest, Eithné reveals some of the world's history, remarking how there used to be many forests like Brokilon before the Conjunction of the Spheres and how mankind fought against the dryads so only the ones in Brokilon remain. They're interrupted though on hearing someone's groans and Ciri realizes it's Dara and runs off to find him nearby just as another dryad removes the arrow and heals his wound with the waters of Brokilon. Eithné then tells the two in no uncertain terms they'll need to drink the waters to reveal if they bear ill intent to Brokilon, in which case they'll die, or if they're pure in heart, in which case they'll live and may stay there in the forest. The queen does note another side effect though: over time the waters will lessen the suffering they've endured but does so by making them forget.
As night falls and Ciri and Dara sit off to the side from the dryads, Dara then asks Ciri why the queen referred to her as Fiona and Ciri informs him she was told by Mousesack not to let anyone know who she was outside the castle before revealing to Dara her real identity as Princess Cirilla. On learning this, Dara becomes angry as he tells Ciri how her grandmother, Queen Calanthe, ordered his family and many other elves to be slaughtered after Filavandrel's uprising and how her soldiers laughed as they raped the women and killed babies. He then notes the only reason he even survived was because he hid but now regrets how he didn't try to save them or fight back, even if it meant dying with the rest. Ciri's left stunned, not knowing what to say, but Dara simply remarks there's nothing she can say before revealing his desire to stay there in Brokilon and how he hopes to forget who he was. He then advises Ciri to do the same, but Ciri says she can't and that she has to find her destiny.
As Ciri sleeps, she's plagued by nightmares of soldiers attacking and killing elves before her nightmare takes on a different form of Cahir moving to cut her down before she jolts awake to find Dara drinking the water. He then assures her everything's going to be ok before Eithné passes the bottle to Ciri and tells her to drink and leave her past behind and join them. After a moment, Ciri proceeds to drink as well but doesn't feel any different. On asking why it didn't work, Eithné simply notes Shan-Kayan calls to her and leads Ciri to it: a large tree in the center of Brokilon. She then cuts into the tree, making liquid stream out, and tells Ciri to drink directly from the source. As Ciri does, she proceeds to have a vision of herself out in the middle of a desert as a very large, luminescent tree looms over her on a hill as it asks Ciri what is she.
The dryads learn the truth about Ciri from Shan-Kayan, and discuss it among themselves in Elder Speech, but Eithné makes it known to all the dryads, with Ciri in attendance, that the princess is allowed to stay in Brokilon. After the rest of the dryads leave, Ciri, not knowing what they were discussing so reliant on reading their body language, confirms her suspicions: many of them, particularly the general, don't care to have Ciri there, but the queen notes they'll still follow her orders. Eithné then presents Ciri with two options: either she can stay or she can continue her journey in search of her destiny.
Reunited with Mousesack.
While learning how to craft arrows with the dryads, Ciri is surprised by Mousesack being led through the forest to her and greets him before asking what happened to him after they split off in Cintra, but he waves it off, merely answering all that's important is he found her and he's to take her back to her rightful place. When Eithné tries to step in, saying Ciri chose to stay with them, Mousesack counters that he knows where to find Geralt as another dryad informs the queen Ciri was promised to him through the Law of Surprise.
Making up her mind, Ciri thanks Eithné and the dryads for their hospitality, but strongly feels Geralt is her destiny and she must continue on. She then turns to Dara, asking him to join her once again and that she considers him family. The dryad queen proceeds to say goodbye, but warns Ciri to always be vigilant and ask the right questions. Afterwards, Ciri hugs her goodbye and departs with Mousesack and Dara.
As the trio make their way out of Brokilon, Ciri bombards Mousesack with questions regarding Geralt, the Law of Surprise, and why she was never told any of this before, and while Mousesack answers some, he gets her to stop after he tells her she and Geralt will be together soon. They then reach Brokilon's exit and start to walk through the winter forest outside. While Ciri's stopped asking questions as they continue to walk, Dara speaks up, asking how the druid escaped Nilfgaard's attack, having been told by Ciri he vanished into thin air, abandoning the princess if that's true. Mousesack then informs them that he was actually pulled through a portal into Nilfgaard, where he was held prisoner for days before Geralt rescued him and sent the druid to retrieve Ciri. As Dara questions the logic of this, Mousesack waves it off, noting Dara can ask the witcher himself as he's waiting in a nearby town as Mousesack continues to lead them to safety. However, Dara pulls Ciri to the side, voicing his suspicions something isn't right and Mousesack might have been turned by Nilfgaard. Further away, Mousesack gets the princess' attention, revealing he saved Calanthe's royal sash and Ciri excitedly takes it from him and continues through the woods as Dara follows from a distance.
As they trek through a small clearing, Ciri, having thought over what Dara and Eithné said, begins to ask Mousesack if he ever stopped missing Skellige, as he left home to help raise Ciri in Cintra, and he confirms he was very homesick. Ciri then begins to bring up related memories from the times she visited Skellige before asking if Mousesack missed the cold as well. As the druid responds he also missed the cold, Ciri stops in her tracks, realizing he's not who he appears to be, and gets angry, stating how the real Mousesack had arthritis and thus hated the cold, and while he was from Skellige, he always said home was in Cintra, with Ciri and her family.
The imposter, called the Adonis, then grabs Ciri, revealing they killed Mousesack and took his form to get her but before they can do anything else, Dara pulls out his silver knife and tries to attack, making the Adonis drop Ciri and grab the knife's hilt instead. However, this causes the imposter's hand to burn and they drop it while trying to choke Dara but Ciri, having seen how it burned the imposter, grabs it off the ground and puts it against the Adonis' neck, burning them yet again and the imposter falls to the ground before changing to their true form: a doppler. Dara grabs the knife from Ciri and pins the Adonis, continuously burning them with the silver blade as he questions the doppler on who wants Ciri and why, though Ciri herself answers it's the man with the winged helmet and that there's something special inside her. However, when Ciri orders Dara to kill the doppler, Dara hesitates and Ciri grabs the knife back to do it herself, but this allows the Adonis to break free, knock Dara out, and knock the silver knife away, forcing Ciri to flee into the woods.
Unfortunately, Ciri doesn't get far and the Adonis catches her and ties her up to a tree before taking her form to confront their employer, though is certain to come back for the princess once done. While the Adonis is away though, Dara manages to find the tied up Ciri and rescues her once more, though this time angry, stating if she'd listened to him they'd still be safe in Brokilon and all Ciri brings is death and terror wherever she goes. Fed up with everything, Dara then leaves, remarking he can't be there for her any longer.
Finding Geralt.
Now alone, Ciri makes her way through a village where she poorly attempts to steal food as she tries to make her way to Skellige. Overhearing this, a nearby woman, Zola, warns Ciri to be careful as it's not safe traveling through the area alone, but Ciri rebuffs this and walks off.
As she passes a group of people watching a puppet skit being put on, she spots some gloves but before she can run off with them, the seller calls to her and she hands over an expensive ring that once belonged to her mother as payment. She then discards the worn out single glove she had and puts on the new ones as Zola approaches her, trying to talk her out of going to Skellige as the roads aren't safe while Ciri tries to walk off from her again. Unperturbed, Zola gets in front of Ciri to stop her and notes she just needs to finish one more errand and make room on her horses, Clip and Clop, but could offer Ciri food and a safe place to stay at her home. Ciri silently nods in agreement, but as soon as Zola heads off to finish her tasks, Ciri steals one of the horses and takes off.
Later that night, Ciri sets up a small campfire out in a field with the stolen horse nearby when she hears the sudden approach of people. Initially wary, Ciri grabs a branch to defend herself but recognizes one of the four men as Anton, one of the kids she played knucklebones with. She runs forward, happy to see him, but he rudely pushes her aside as he notes to another he knew it was her at the market before they run over to the horse and start to pilfer the bags. As Ciri tries to tell them to stop, another pushes her back, noting Nilfgaard has a nice reward for her. She then tries to plead to Anton, who reveals he never liked her, only playing and letting her win because he had to all because she was a princess. As the group then proceed to pull her to the center of the clearing, Ciri releases another magical pulse, this time with another voice speaking through her of a prophecy before she blacks out.
The next morning, Ciri wakes up in the field as Zola appears over her and gets her to sit up, though as Ciri looks around, she notices not only is the field's grass somehow mowed down, but the bodies of the four men and the horse are all dead, appearing to have been thrown and subsequently impaled by various trees nearby. As Zola asks what happened, Ciri responds that they came for her, to which Zola notes they got what they deserved then before taking Ciri back to her place.
As night arrives, Zola's son, Nadbor, tries to get Ciri to talk as she quietly watches him groom a horse, going as far as questioning if she's dumb when his mother hears this and slaps him upside the head, remarking Ciri's been through hell and likely not ready to talk much right now before asking if Ciri can at least teach her son some manners while she lives with them. Right after, they hear rumbling and look outside to see a fireball flying through the night sky for a target in the distance and realize Nilfgaard is attacking Sodden.
Despite going to bed, Ciri's still awake and Zola tries to comfort Ciri as they hear the battle raging on in the distance, noting Nilfgaard has no reason to attack them as they're out of the way, but if the worst comes to pass, Zola remarks she's at peace with herself, having everything she had ever wanted: a husband, son, a roof over her head, and now a daughter in Ciri.
The next morning Ciri snaps out of her sleep, having been woken up by hearing Geralt's dream where he was calling for Yennefer, and remembers her grandmother telling her to find Geralt of Rivia. With that, she leaves Zola's home and sets off into the nearby forest. At one point she begins to run, sensing Geralt, and finds him a short time later and the two hug each other, while Geralt remarks on destiny. Looking up at him, Ciri then asks him who is Yennefer.
Meeting Nivellen.
Upon their discovery that Yennefer supposedly died at the Battle of Sodden Hill, Ciri and Geralt turned to an old friend of his for help. It wasn't until they arrived that they learned that Nivellen had been cursed by a priestess and turned into a beast after trashing the Temple of the Lionheaded Spider while high on godflesh mushrooms. He also shared with Ciri how he met Geralt years ago when he was hired by Nivellen's father to tend to a wyvern infestation.
Nivellen reminded Ciri of Mousesack, who she sometimes forgot was even gone. She wished that she could go back in time and save everyone. She then asked Nivellen what it's like for him to be alone. The loneliness ate him alive. He'd tried many times to cure himself, having piled many a lass with treasure to kiss him, hoping there was a grain of truth to the fairy tales, but each path was a letdown. Ciri suggested that he may have simply not found the right girl, recalling how Mousesack told her of a hedgehog man who was cured by true love, which Nivellen didn't think he was worthy of, informing Ciri about how he killed all his servants the day he turned, not knowing what he was or his own strength, but she didn't believe that was entirely his fault. Ciri watched her entire home burn to the ground with her family trapped inside. She knew monsters, but Nivellen simply didn't seem like one to her.
Ciri awakened from a bad dream to find a blue-eyed girl watching over her. Vereena asked if Ciri liked the dress she left for her and then revealed that she too was different, by telepathically communicating with Ciri, who questioned if Vereena was a monster, but she didn't anwser, rather retorting Ciri's question by saying that being different didn't make one a monster and that humans did monstrous things all the time. Upon realizing that Nivellen hid Vereena because he loved her, Vereena kissed Ciri's hand and told her this must be their secret until she left, causing Ciri to fall asleep.
Ciri was awakened from her sleep yet again, but this time by Geralt, who informed her that there was a bruxa in the house and that she needed to wait outside by Roach. Inside, a brawl ensued between Geralt and Vereena that led outside, where Ciri watched as the two traded blows. When Ciri goes to check on Vereena after she is stabbed by Geralt's sword, she ended up in the monster's crosshairs. Vereena held Ciri by her throat and threatened to kill her if Geralt didn't leave. Fortunately, Nivellen intervened and stabbed her with a pole, allowing Ciri to escape her grasp just before Geralt beheads Vereena, which also happened to break Nivellen's curse. It was then that he revealed the real reason he was cursed, not for trashing a temple but rather raping the priestess.
Arriving at Kaer Morhen.
Ciri was taken to Kaer Morhen by Geralt, where he reunited with his witcher brethren, and she proceeded to look around for a suitable room.
As Geralt examined the arm of the leshy that Eskel encountered, Ciri wondered if all they'd be doing was studying monsters and collecting herbs, as she wanted to start training, but Geralt warned her it was too dangerous, not that Ciri cared. She simply wanted to become strong enough to kill the Black Knight, but Geralt informed her that they didn't kill out of fear, rather to save lives.
Ciri learned about some of the witcher heritage from Vesemir. Klef was one of the first witchers, but he was killed by a demon who wreaked havoc on the witchers until they bound her deep in the forests. He then told her about Deglan, who was killed by men in their very halls. He taught Vesemir everything he knew and made him a witcher. Vesemir, however, was more interested in Ciri's history than his own and questioned how she escaped Cintra, but Ciri deflected, simply informing Vesemir that Geralt said she'd be protected with them.
When the den was attacked, a small group of whores were placed in Ciri's room, but when they got tired of waiting, Danica led her girls to safety after getting directions from Ciri for the fastest way out. Not long after, Geralt returned to Ciri's room after killing Eskel, who had been turned into a leshy. With that close call in mind, Geralt had decided it was time to start training Ciri.
Training at Kaer Morhen.
Ciri trained with a wooden sword on a sack filled with straw whilst Geralt repaired his armor, but when she began struggling with her technique due to exhaustion, Geralt called it for the day, telling Ciri that she needed food and rest. Ciri then had another one of her visions, but this time around, it wasn't about the Black Knight.
After being antagonized by Lambert for her less than challenging means of training, Ciri decided to take her chance on the witcher training course, but her first attempt on the pendulum went awry and she was knocked to the ground. Still, Ciri continued on the witcher course, even as she was knocked off the pendulum time after time. When she finally cleared it, she was immediately knocked down by the following obstacle and bled on the ground. Lambert wasn't impressed and told Ciri that she belonged in a castle.
Despite being knocked down over and over, Ciri continued to get back up and tackle the course. Lambert tried to convince her to get down, but she proceeded, and the witchers watched intensively as she made her way through the course, nearly completing the course, but she took a hard fall at the end.
Ciri was frustrated with herself for failing to complete the course. Admittedly, she could do anything, but it doesn't mean that she has to, Geralt explained. Ciri recalled Geralt telling her that they had to face their fears, which he admitted was true, but Ciri had to train first. Geralt had known many who wanted to be great fighters, but they're all dead now.
Geralt questioned Ciri about the feeling she got when someone was coming after her. The first word that came to mind was that she was being pulled, but she didn't know what towards. If she were to follow that feeling, however, it would take her to the woods, where Geralt revealed that he was at her parents' wedding feast and saw her mother exhibit uncontrolled magical power, destroying an entire throne room. It would seem Ciri inherited that power. They followed the pull to the leshy that infected Eskel. However, before Geralt could attack, it was rip apart by a much bigger, deadlier, and unfamiliar creature. Ciri ran for cover under a rock while Geralt fought the beast, but she was found and forced into a corner by the monster. Fortunately, Geralt came to her rescue and beheaded the beast with his sword.
Ciri continued her training with Geralt. However, Ciri tripped after hearing a noise and tumbled down a hill, where she comes into contact with Triss, who extended a helping hand after Ciri took a rough fall and healed the scar on her cheek just. Before long, Geralt joined them, revealing that he invited Triss to Kaer Morhen to help guide Ciri.
Rather than her usual ragged clothing, Ciri wore a bright-colored shirt with a flower in her hair to match Triss, but she quickly came to regret this decision and fled with tears filling her eyes when heckled by Lambert and Coen. Triss followed behind Ciri and took her to the lab, where she explained that it took her a long time to learn to control her powers. While there's no evidence of mutagenic alchemy in the monster Geralt killed, Triss did uncover stellacite, like from a monolith. Inside the leshy that turned Eskel, they uncover more stellacite, meaning they came from the same place, more specifically the same monolith. It was then that Ciri revealed that when Nilfgaard attacked Cintra, just outside the city walls, she saw a monolith topple. Before she could reveal anything more, she touched the stellacite and had a vision about death to come. When she awakened, Geralt and Triss had moved her to another room and then asked to know everything she did. And so, Ciri revealed that when the Black Knight captured her, she screamed and that's when the monolith cracked and fell.
Becoming a Witcher.
Ciri neglected to show up for her magic lesson with Triss to continue her training on the witcher course in an attempt to better conquer her fears. When she finally returned inside, she learned from Vesemir that she had Elder blood, the single most important component to making more witchers. With a vial of her blood, they could make more. Ciri agreed to help him so long as he tested it on her first, a proposition he initially turned down, as many didn't survive the trials. However, with the witchers slowly dying off, Ciri convinced Vesemir to agree to her terms.
Ciri believed that becoming a witcher might help her find a new truth, but Triss attempted to convince otherwise, proposing a different method to find out where Ciri's power came from by performing a Dol Durza, which roughly translated to Valley of the Soul, which allowed her to enter the deepest layer of Ciri's consciousness and uncover things that may be hidden, like genetic memories. In doing so, they not only walked through Ciri's memories, but those of her mother and grandmother's as well. However, at some point, Triss realized that the Dol Durza wasn't functioning as it typically would, but the breaking point wasn't until Triss was nearly killed by Lara Dorren, who referred to Ciri as the "Child of Elder blood, child of wrath," and claimed that she would bring death to the world.
Seeing how frightened Triss was of her after the Dol Durza only further convinced Ciri to become a witcher. And so, she went to Vesemir and insisted that they begin. However, Geralt returned just in time to stop them. Ciri wanted to be a witcher so that she no longer had to feel the pain of her past. No matter how hard she trained, it was never enough. However, Geralt explained that no one could forget who they were, including witchers. Their best chance was to kill the hatred they hold on to and move on.
Hunting the Chernobog.
Ciri and Geralt hunted down the chernobog that escaped from the monolith outside Cintra. Unfortunately, their first encounter near the river ended with Roach getting severely hurt. After Geralt put her out of her misery, he and Ciri staged a trap to lure in the monster. Ciri climbed up on top of a rock to lure the chernobog in. Just when it was nearly within reaching distance of her, Geralt drove his sword through its chest.
Ciri was then taken to Melitele's Temple, where graduates of the temple school were known to become midwives, historians, healers, and witchers. There, she met Nenneke, who told Ciri her plans to guide her in the art of controlling her Chaos. When Ciri mentioned "Daughter of Chaos," Nenneke questioned where she heard that term, as that knowledge had been lost to time, and knowledge like that was usually lost for a reason, she informed Ciri before introducing her to Jarre, one of her best students, who proceeded to take Ciri to the library, where she was to use the Orbuculum for her studies.
While searching for Geralt, Ciri met Yennefer within the temple, who they believed to be dead. Ciri and Yennefer quickly became acquainted, with Yennefer telling her about unicorns and how she used to own a stuffed one until it broke. Ciri knew little of Yennefer, but she recalled Geralt saying that she was one of the most powerful mages he'd ever known. Ciri had only dreamt about Yennefer once, but it was before she even knew she existed.
Roaming the halls during the late hours of the night, Ciri ran into Nenneke lighting dozens of candles to welcome late stragglers seeking refuge. Ciri offered to help and lit a candle in Mousesack's honor, who she wished would've told her what she was. No one did until she met Geralt. Her grandmother was brave and never hid from anything but hated elves despite Ciri's Elder blood. Nenneke reasoned that hatred was a circle of fear and desperation. Perhaps her grandmother's hypocrisy was rooted in a desire to protect her. Ciri's true power resided in more than her blood. With proper guidance, she may have the ability to break the cycle of hatred once and for all. Ciri then asked what she was supposed to do with the Orbuculum, but that was for her to figure out on her own.
Ciri found a history book lying on the floor with blood soaked on the cover. She followed the blood trail to Jarre, who lied unconscious on the floor. Accompanied by the Michelet brothers, Rience attempted to take Ciri, trapping her in a fire barrier until Geralt and Yennefer came to her rescue. Whilst Geralt slaughtered the Michelet brothers, Ciri and Yennefer locked themselves in a room. With Rience on the other side of the door trying to melt it open, the Orbuculum began to glow, sensing Ciri's magic. With no magic of her own, Yennefer taught Ciri how to create a portal, which they escaped through.
Returning to Cintra.
Ciri portalled herself and Yennefer not too far from Cintra. In fact, they were at Yola's home, the same house where Ciri had her first dream about Yennefer. In one of the rooms, they discovered the charred remains of Yola and her family, who helped Ciri and gave her shelter. Ciri partially blamed herself for their death before coming to the conclusion that Rience could possibly be working for Nilfgaard and maybe took Geralt to their nearest outpost, that being Cintra. Ciri had fantasized about going back and killing the Black Knight, and now the opportunity had presented itself, which Yennefer would not allow her to face alone.
Ciri and Yennefer reached a broken bridge, and the only other way would be around the river, which could take days. So for lesson number two, Yennefer taught Ciri to use her Chaos to repair the bridge, a task she struggled with, so much so that blood dripped from her eyes until Yennefer forced her to stop. Frustrated, Ciri screamed so intensely that she teleported Yennefer, herself, as well as the horses to the other side of the bridge. Yennefer wiped her face and told Ciri to never apologize for her power.
Ciri and Yennefer came to a stop just outside Cintra, at the sight of the monolith collapse. If they ever got separated, Yennefer told Ciri to remember that magic was all she had and that it was a part of her. As they proceeded towards the shattered black door, Yennefer advised Ciri to turn back if she was afraid and apologized for betraying her, as Geralt wasn't at Cintra, leading Ciri to suspect that Yennefer had been conspiring with the fire mage at the temple the entire time. Upset by her betrayal, Ciri's powers manifested and emitted a rippling effect, cracking the ground and nearby Cintran kingdom, occupied by Nilfgaard, who came charging towards them, but fortunately, Geralt arrived just in time to save them and have Jaskier take Ciri back to Kaer Mohern. However, on the path back, she got possessed by Voleth Meir.
Possessed by the Deathless Mother.
Ciri awakened in some kind of dream, where Mousesack informed her that the knighting ceremony started 20 minutes and that her grandmother had her dance card full. Ciri was in disbelief that Mousesack stood before her and tried to touch his face. Meanwhile, Ciri's body was being controlled by the Deathless Mother, who slaughtered witchers in their sleep.
Ciri's escorted into the throne room by Mousesack and taken to sit alongside her grandmother, where she remained a bit overwhelmed, more so when her grandmother pulled her in for a hug. Martin then approached and asked Ciri to dance, an invitation that Ciri eagerly accepted.
Mousesack joined Ciri for a dance and informed her that if she were to marry Martin, they'd forge quite the exceptional bloodline. Speaking of bloodlines, Ciri asked to know more about her own, to which Mousesack promised that he'd share with her some day soon. Ciri then began to hear Geralt's voice, which momentarily disrupted the dream until the arrival of her parents regained her attention.
Ciri ran into the arms of her mother and father, who told her that they'd been there the entire time, always loving her. Just like before, Ciri's dream world began to distort at the sound of Geralt's voice. Vesemir chimed in, telling Ciri that he believed in her, while Pavetta and Duny encouraged her to stay with them. Meanwhile, in the real world, Yennefer had slit both her wrists open and summoned Voleth Meir into her, causing Ciri's dream world to disintegrate along with her family.
When Ciri awakened, Geralt explained to her that they needed to trap Voleth Meir once and for all by opening a portal through the monolith and sending her through. And so, Ciri opened a portal, and she, Geralt, and Yennefer were pulled inside and taken to Voleth Meir's home world, where she was released from Yennefer and joined the ranks of the Wild Hunt as Ciri pulled herself, Geralt, and Yennefer back through the portal.

Calanthe Fiona Riannon of Cintra (b. 1215 - d. 1263), known also as the "Lioness of Cintra" was a queen of Cintra, the mother of Pavetta, and grandmother of Ciri. She was known for her beauty, bravery, and ferocity on the battlefield.
Biography.
Defending Cintra from Nilfgaard.
Queen Calanthe and King Eist hosts a knight induction ceremony with their granddaughter, Ciri. Afterward, they host a celebratory feast, where Queen Calanthe, King Eist, and Mousesack discuss the encroachment of Nilfgaard. Should they fall, Ciri will rise to throne. Calanthe insists that they won't fall as there won't be a war, but with Ciri being so persistent to know more, Calanthe gives Ciri her first lesson; "as in life, it's impossible to be fully prepared for battle." She's to keep her sword close and keeping moving. Queen Calanthe and King Eist then get word of Nilfgaard's arrival.
Just outside Cintra, Queen Calanthe and King Eist defend their home from the Nilfgaardian invaders in a field as opposed to waiting for aid from their fleet of ships that was delayed by the storm. The Nilfgaardians' sheer force in numbers allow them to overwhelm the Cintran army. Queen Calanthe is forced to retreat after King Eist is killed in battle; an arrow in the eye, fired by Cahir.
Calanthe returns to the castle, where she lies bloody and badly wounded. Cintra is also under attack, and Nilfgaard have made their way to the city. Only 100 or so citizens are within the walls of Queen Calanthe's castle. Calanthe reminds Ciri that one day she will rule Cintra. As the Nilfgaardians reach the gate, Mousesack creates a magical barrier around the citadel.
As night falls, the Nilfgaardians breach the castle gates. In the face of defeat, Queen Calanthe orders the entire castle to commit suicide by poison, to spare them the fate of being tortured and murdered by the imposing army. Calanthe sends Ciri off with Lazlo and Mousesack, telling her to find Geralt of Rivia, as he is her destiny. Calanthe stays behind. On her way out, Ciri screams, causing a magical pulse. With Ciri being escorted out, Calanthe reveals to Mousesack that Ciri is the reason Nilfgaard attacked.
Once Ciri makes it out of the castle safely, Queen Calanthe jumps out a window to her death.
Royal betrothal.
Years in the past, Queen Calanthe returns victorious from a raiding party just in time to oversee a betrothal party for her daughter Princess Pavetta. She has already secretly arranged for her daughter to marry Crach an Craite despite Pavetta's numerous objections. Calanthe explains that marrying Crach is the key to Cintra having power after she dies and that Pavetta's feelings are of little concern.
When Geralt of Rivia arrives, Queen Calanthe inquires about his encounter with the elves. Geralt explains that he got his "ass kicked" and was about to have his throat cut when Filavandrel spared his life. Impressed with Geralt's willingness to paint himself in the shadow of his failures, Calanthe invites him to her table.
Calanthe questions what brought Geralt to her daughter's wedding feast. He explains to the queen that he's only there to protect Jaskier from vengeful, royal cuckolds. However, she hopes that should chaos ensue, that Geralt would strategically move certain "irritants" from her court. However, Geralt insists that he's not for hire and only there to help a friend.
Lord Peregrine of Nilfgaard attends the betrothal party in hopes of wedding Pavetta, claiming that his marriage with Pavetta would unite the jewels of the north and south, forging an unbreakable alliance. He also makes mention of his "potent seed," which would guarantee the strongest of male heirs. Queen Calanthe makes a mockery of him and his backwater country Nilfgaard.
Queen Calanthe questions Geralt on why there are so few witchers remaining. Geralt responds that it is no longer possible to create more of them since the sacking of Kaer Morhen. Geralt asks why she chooses to risk her life in the battlefield when she can rest on the throne. For Queen Calanthe, there's a simplicity in killing monsters.
Lord Urcheon of Erlenwald interrupts the ceremony, his face hidden under knight's armor, there to claim Pavetta's hand in marriage. Eist knocks his helmet off, which hid a monstrous form. Queen Calanthe orders that Geralt kill him, but he refuses, explaining that Urcheon is no monster. Rather, he's a man who's been cursed. Queen Calanthe orders her guards to slay Urcheon anyway, and Urcheon disarms the guards and explains to Queen Calanthe that Pavetta belongs to him under the Law of Surprise. More of the queen's guards attack. Geralt comes to Urcheon's aid. Together, they dispose of Queen Calanthe's guards with ease. An even larger fight then breaks out among the guests until Queen Calanthe stands center room and commands the fighting to end.
Pavetta greets Duny, with whom she's been engaged in a secret relationship with for over a year. He was cursed as a young boy, and lived his whole life in misery until the day he saved Queen Calanthe's husband, King Roegner from certain death. By tradition, he chose the Law of Surprise as payment. Eist recommends that Queen Calanthe honor the tradition, because Destiny has determined the surprise be Pavetta. When he heard the king returned to find a child on the way, Duny had originally abandoned all hope of claiming the Law of Surprise. He knew no woman could accept him as he is. So he waited until the twelfth bell when the curse breaks. He never intended to meet Pavetta, only to watch from afar, but destiny intervened and they fell in love.
Both Eist and Mousesack advise Queen Calanthe to honor destiny's wish. The debt must be paid or the order of the world falls apart. Queen Calanthe seems to reluctantly accept destiny, handing over her sword and extending her hand to Duny. She pulls him close, whispers "here is your destiny," and pulls out a knife aimed at his throat. Pavetta screams out and suddenly her abilities awakens, sending everyone flying across the room. Pavetta and Duny float above the room until Geralt knocks them down.
Calanthe thought that Pavetta's grandmother's gift had skipped her, as it did Calanthe. She admits to be wrong about so many things, and then announces that the Law of Surprise will be honored and Pavetta will marry Duny. Furthermore, Queen Calanthe herself has agreed to marry Eist; there will be two vows tonight. Pavetta kisses Duny, and he transforms back into his human form. Queen Calanthe's blessing of their marriage lifted the curse and fulfilled the destiny.
Denying the Law of Surprise.
Just days prior to Nilfgaard's attack on Cintra, Calanthe discussed with Sir Danek and Sir Lazlo the encroachment of Nilfgaard. She then came face-to-face with Geralt of Rivia for the first time in 12 years. Geralt came to protect Ciri, who Calanthe raised on her own. When Calanthe tried to buy Geralt off, Mousesack interjected that money couldn't undo the Law of Surprise. King's who've tried to outbid destiny ended up on pikes. He advises Calanthe to give the child over to him if she had any doubt in her mind that Ciri wasn't safe in Cintra. Geralt promised to take her, protect, and bring her back unharmed. Calanthe reluctantly agreed and exclaimed to the townspeople that Law of Surprise had been called.
Unbeknownst to Geralt, Calanthe had no intentions on giving her up, and instead, disguised someone else's child as Ciri and in preparation to hand her over to Geralt. Mousesack watched on silently. Calanthe then told Geralt that she'd summon him when Ciri was ready to leave.
Calanthe was confronted by Geralt after realizing that she tried to send him off with a girl that wasn't Princess Cirilla. Calanthe insisted that Ciri was safe with her until the day came that she would take over the throne. Furthermore, she refused to give Geralt word any further thought. The last time she listened to him, she let a hedgehog into her court, which ultimately resulted in Pavetta's death. Calanthe refused to lose Ciri the same way she lost Pavetta and ordered Eist to get Geralt out of her kingdom.
Days later, Calanthe led her men to war with Nilfgaard, where Eist was killed by Cahir. After sending Ciri away with Mousesack and Lazlo, she jumped out a window to her death as Nilfgaard invaded Cintra.

Roach (Polish: "Płotka") is the name that Geralt of Rivia, the witcher, gives to all of his horses. His preference is for mares.
Biography.
TBA
During a fight with a chernobog, Roach is gravely injured, having been slashed by the monster's large talons. Not able to heal and save her, Geralt says his farewell to Roach and proceeds to put her down as peacefully as he can. After Geralt rescues Jaskier from a Redanian prison, they bump into Yarpen Zigrin and his men on the road who readily let Geralt borrow a horse that Geralt promises to pay him back for. Like all his past horses, Geralt also names his new horse Roach.

Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove better known as Jaskier (b. 1222), was a bard and a close friend of Geralt of Rivia.
Biography.
Captured by elves.
After getting booed during his performance at a local tavern, Jaskier approached Geralt of Rivia and insisted that he review his performance. Geralt told Jaskier that the creatures in his song didn't exist, and Jaskier realized that he was a witcher, which he announced to the bar. A patron named Nettly overheard and offered to pay Geralt 100 ducats if he killed the "devil" that was stealing their grain. Geralt agreed to kill the devil, and Jaskier invited himself along, during which time he offered to help improve Geralt's image, so that he was no longer seen as a monstrous killer.
While hunting this "devil", Jaskier and Geralt were attacked by a Sylvan named Torque. It threw a stone at Jaskier and knocked him out. It then charged at Geralt, knocking him to the ground. Torque charged for a second time, but this time Geralt grabbed him by the horns and slammed him to the ground. To his surprise, it could talk. Rather than killing Torque, Geralt showed mercy, allowing him to live, but only if he left. However, someone snuck up behind Geralt and knocked him out too.
Jaskier and Geralt woke up in a cave, tied back-to-back with each other and surrounded by elves. They were repeatedly hit by a sickly elf named Toruviel. Geralt waited until she got close enough, and headbutted her. They were joined by Torque and the elven monarch, Filavandrel. Torque had been stealing food and medicine for them ever since they were forced out of Dol Blathanna. Jaskier was shocked, as he was under the impression that the elves willingly left to return to their "golden palaces," when in reality they retreated to simple caves. Unfortunately, they couldn't allow Jaskier and Geralt to leave in fear that Posada would learn that they had been stealing, causing the humans to attack, which would undoubtedly result in casualties on both sides. In the efforts of self-preservation, Filavandrel knew he must kill them. Filavandrel's elders worked with humans and got robbed of all they had, and when they fought back, they were slaughtered in a battle that would come to be known as the "Great Cleansing." Bringing his people down from the mountains would mean bowing down to the humans, and would make them slaves. Geralt advised them to rebuild elsewhere and grow in numbers. Filavandrel had a change of heart and decided to let Jaskier and Geralt go.
Jaskier and Geralt left the mountains, having been released by Filavandrel. In return, Geralt gave them the 150 ducats he was paid to kill Torque. In this adventure, Jaskier had gained a newfound respect for Filavandrel. They survived the Great Cleansing once. Maybe they could do it again. Jaskier started to sing a tune while Geralt followed alongside.
Royal betrothal.
Geralt entered a tavern after killing a selkiemore. He was riddled with a foul smell and covered in the guts of the monster he had just slain. Jaskier started to sing a tune in favor of Geralt and the people in the tavern joined in, celebrating Geralt's victorious battle against the beast. Jaskier then asked Geralt for a favor; in exchange for acting as his bodyguard for one night, Geralt would receive food, women, and wine.
Jaskier required protection while attending a royal betrothal as every lord, knight, and king would be present, many of which he had personally crossed, having had affairs with their lovers and even some of their mothers. Jaskier questioned what happened to witchers as they age and if they want any more from life beyond killing monsters. Geralt explained there is no after for witchers. They hunt until they get killed. And he wanted nothing more than that for himself.
Jaskier and Geralt arrived at the betrothal party for Princess Pavetta's hand in marriage. Geralt was immediately recognized by an old associate of his, Mousesack. Geralt came to Jaskier's defense as he was being interrogated by a nobleman, who suspected Jaskier was having an affair with his wife, demanding that Jaskier drop his trousers so that he could verify it. Geralt claimed that Jaskier was "kicked in the balls by an ox," so the man apologized and gave him a coin to "drown your sorrows."
As the evening progressed, a knight by the name of Lord Urcheon of Erlenwald interrupted the ceremony. Queen Calanthe ordered to have him killed after discovering that he was a monster. However, Geralt came to his defense and together, they defeated her guards. Queen Calanthe took it upon herself to kill Urcheon even after discovering that he was in love with her daughter and had claim to her by the Law of Surprise. Calanthe pulled him close, whispered "Here is your destiny." and pulled out a knife aimed at his throat. Pavetta screamed out and suddenly her abilities awoke, sending everyone flying across the room, Jaskier included. Pavetta and Duny then floated above the room until Geralt knocked them down. Realizing the error in her ways, Calanthe decided to honor the Law of Surprise. In honoring destiny, Calanthe freed Urcheon of his curse. He now wished to repay Geralt for saving his life, and Geralt choose the Law of Surprise just as Pavetta suddenly threw up, signifying that she was pregnant.
A djinn and three wishes.
Jaskier reunited with Geralt at the river's edge after months, if not years apart. Geralt was fishing for a djinn that was buried at the bottom of the lake. He couldn't sleep, and Jaskier concluded that his sleeplessness was directly related to what Mousesack said to him about the Law of Surprise and claiming Princess Pavetta's child. Geralt pulled a bottle inscribed with a wizard's seal from the lake. The djinn was locked away inside. Jaskier wrestled with Geralt for control of the bottle, unintentionally releasing the djinn. Jaskier made two of the three available wishes before shattering the bottle on the ground. As Geralt gathered the shattered pieces, the djinn escaped, and Jaskier started coughing up blood.
Geralt took Jaskier to a nearby elf healer named Chireadan and discovered that his afflictions were magic based. His throat was being attacked and if the spell's action wasn't stopped as soon as possible, it's effects may have become irreversible, eventually resulting in death. The medicine provided by the healer would only give Jaskier few more hours. Chireadan advised that Geralt take Jaskier to another town for help as the only mage in close proximity was extremely dangerous. Geralt disregarded Chireadan's warning and set off in search of this malicious mage, said to be imprisoned in the mayor's house.
Jaskier and Geralt broke into the mayor's house to find him under some kind of trance. They stumbled upon a massive orgy, orchestrated by Yennefer of Vengerberg, the mage of Rinde. She deduced that he was a mutant, a witcher to be exact. The famous White Wolf, as she refered to him. She questioned just how powerful he is. Whatever the djinn did to Jaskier started to spread. Should Yennefer cure him, Geralt promised to indulge her curiosity. Yennefer agreed to his terms. She stated the phrase "ragamuffin," and the citizens of Rinde awoke from their trance, completely unaware of their actions.
Yennefer put Jaskier in a deep healing sleep. The following morning, as Yennefer prepared the spell, Jaskier awoke. She held him against the wall and ordered him to make a wish. Jaskier made his final wish, and Yennefer released him. She then started chanting to summon the djinn. Geralt returned, offering his help. He tried to stop Yennefer before the power consumed her, and she dies. Jaskier expressed his last wish, but the djinn only seemed to be getting stronger. That's because as Geralt explained, it was he who had the wishes. Jaskier and Chireadan watched from outside as the house collapsed. They initially presumed Geralt and Yennefer to be dead, but upon further examination, found the two having sex inside.
Hunting a dragon.
Jaskier and Geralt were approached by Borch Three Jackdaws and his two Zerrikanian companions Téa and Véa. They sought Geralt out hoping to gain his assistance in slaying a green dragon that had landed across the border in King Niedamir's mountains. Locals spotted it and went after it in search of treasure. They succeeded only in wounding the creature and angering it so righteously that it swooped down from its lair and set half a hillside ablaze. The king was set to marry the princess of a rival kingdom, Malleore, and he's concerned with the creature's presence. So, he commissioned a hunt to kill it and four teams had signed on. The winner got the dragon's treasure board and the title of lord over one of King Niedamir's vassal states.
Geralt initially declined Borch's offer as he didn't kill dragons. However, Borch was in need of one final adventure, and he thought that killing a dragon would bring him that. With a witcher on his team, he'd be unstoppable. Joining them on the hunt were a group of dwarves and Reavers. With the introduction of Yennefer and Eyck of Denesle as the fourth team, Geralt agreed to join Borch on his hunt, much to Jaskier's disapproval.
Jaskier and Geralt spoke to Yennefer for the first time in year. She couldn't help but wonder why she kept running into Geralt despite walking the earth for decades prior and never meeting a single witcher. She explained that she was there to accompany Eyck as he was to slay the dragon.
While on the path to kill the dragon, Jaskier suddenly came face-to-face with a hirikka while picking berries for Tèa and Vèa. Geralt surmised that the creature was starving and of no danger to them. Eyck completely disregarded him and killed it. All four groups decided to settle down on the mountain side. Geralt, Jaskier, Borch, Tèa, Vèa, Yennefer, Eyck, Yarpen, the leader of the dwarves, and Boholt, the leader of the Reavers roasted the hirikka and feasted. Jaskier doubted the mere existence of dragons until Geralt assured them to be real, though their numbers were dwindling. Green dragons were the most common. Red dragons less so. Black dragons were the rarest. Borch added that gold dragons were in fact the rarest. Geralt retorted that they were a myth. Whether that be true or not, gold dragons met the same fate of any other dragon; they died out.
Yennefer awakened the following morning to find Eyck missing. Yarpen found him dead by a tree with his pants down and throat slit. Nevertheless, the hunt continued. Yarpen suspected that the Reavers killed Eyck, and so he knew of a short cut across the mountains that he only shared with Jaskier, Geralt, Borch, Tèa and Vèa. Proposing a truce until they reached the next peak. Yarpen and his men have guided Jaskier, Geralt, Yennefer, Borch, Tèa and Vèa to a fairly narrow path lined with wooden boards alongside the mountain. A tight squeeze for anyone larger than that of a dwarf. The board broke beneath Borch's feet and he falls, as does Tèa and Vèa. The only thing preventing them from plummeting to the ground was Geralt holding on to the other end of the chain. Borch told Geralt to let him go. When Geralt refused, Borch let go of the chain, shortly followed by Tèa and Vèa, and the three of them disappeared within the fog as they fell to the ground below.
Jaskier told Geralt that he did his best to save them. There wasn't much he could do. He suggested that they give up on hunt and provided Geralt give him another chance to prove himself as a worthy travel companion, they head for the coast.
Jaskier awakened at the camp site all alone the following morning. He called out to Geralt and the dwarves with no response. By the time he made his way to the cave, the entrance is littered with Reaver bodies and much to his surprise, Tèa and Vèa were very much still alive and defending the cave. Yarpen and the dwarves unfroze only to realize they missed the action.
Geralt grew angry after losing Yennefer's affection and blamed Jaskier for all his recent troubles. The Child Surprise. The djinn. All of it could be traced back to him. Geralt exclaimed that if life could give him one blessing, it would be to take Jaskier off his hands. With that being said, Jaskier - clearly hurt by Geralt - would get the story from the others to write his song and depart.
The Sandpiper.
Jaskier, known to many elven travelers as the Sandpiper, had been providing elves with safe travel to Cintra. One morning, he received an unexpected visit from Yennefer, who was aware of what he'd been doing and was on the run as well. Jaskier informed her that there were anonymous benefactors working behind the scenes to help him save the elves, leading Yennefer to question why he was even concerned. Jaskier was at the great oak Bleobheris when it was raided. The Seat of Friendship, the Druid's called it. Where every free thinker was welcome, no matter their race or creed. The elves were only the first. After they were all dead, they would come for everyone else they deem as different, Jaskier feared. Yennefer then revealed that she and Cahir need to get to Cintra.
Jaskier distracted the guard at the dock so that the others could sneak aboard the ship. When the guard asked for his papers for transit, Jaskier began singing one of his songs, which the guard recognized and began singing along with, as his niece was a big fan of Jaskier's, so much so, that the guard was willing to let Jaskier aboard without seeing his papers. However, Jaskier turned around and confronted the man after he made a couple unflattering remarks about his songs. This resulted in a dispute and the guard ultimately asking to see his papers. Fortunately, one of the elven travelers sacrificed himself as a distraction by saying, "Fuck the North!" This allowed the others to sneak on to the boat.
Jaskier guided the elves and Cahir down into the ship and asked what happened to Yennefer, to which she revealed that she lost her magic. As an artist, it was his job to put himself in other people's shoes, so he found no joy in her troubles. Like her, he was scared that one day the muses would stop speaking to him, because who were they when they could no longer do the one thing they were put on the Continent to do. Yennefer replied that they had to find a new purpose. Jaskier then told Yennefer goodbye and wished her good luck. However, upon his return topside, he was taken. 
Tortured by Rience.
Jaskier was taken and tortured by Rience, who suspected that he may of knew of Geralt's whereabouts, but he insisted that he hadn't seen Geralt in months or his Child Surprise. Rience wasn't convinced and used fire to burn the answers from Jaskier, who pleaded with Rience to believe him when he said that he didn't know anything about Geralt. Fortunately for Jaskier, Yennefer stumbled in, posing as his drunken wife. With a mouthful of alcohol, Yennefer waited until Rience conjured fire before spitting the alcohol out and engulfing his face in fire, allowing her and Jaskier to escape.
After getting away, Jaskier revealed to Yennefer that Rience was after Geralt and instructed her to warn him, but without magic, she couldn't. They were then approached by three men, on which harassed Yennefer until she kicked him in between the legs. With the other two men chasing after them, she and Jaskier split up. When Jaskier finally caught up to Yennefer, he discovered that she'd been taken prisoner. However, as they were about to take her away, she muttered an incantation and disappeared. Unfortunately for Jaskier, he was caught peeping and thrown in jail.
Freed by Geralt.
To fill the void while locked in a cell, Jaskier sang some songs with his musical companions, a couple of rats. Fortunately, he didn't remain imprisoned much longer, as he was freed by Geralt, who embraced him with a hug. Jaskier remained upset with Geralt for their last encounter, but his need to find Ciri and Yennefer took priority.
While washing up in a stream, Jaskier revealed to Geralt that Yennefer saved his life. She even risked her life for his, while being on the run after losing her magic. However, when she was imprisoned in the whorehouse, he recalled her magically disappearing after muttering an incantation about a hut, leading Geralt to come to the conclusion that she was in league with Voleth Meir, the Deathless Mother, who was imprisoned by the first witchers and entombed in a hut.
On the other side of the stream, they crossed paths with Yarpen Zigrin and his crew, from whom they borrow transportation to Cintra, where they found Yennefer and Ciri under attack by guards. After killing the guards, Geralt instructed Jaskier to take Ciri back to Kaer Morhen whilst he stayed behind to kill the Deathless Mother.
Battle at Kaer Mohern.
Jaskier was awakened from his sleep by Yennefer, who informed him that Ciri had been possessed by the Deathless Mother. Together, they headed to the lab, where Yennefer attempted to make a potion that would remove Voleth Meir from Ciri without killing her. For the time being, she found active jasper, which was a provider of warmth, energy, and balance, telling Jaskier to give it to Geralt, as it would help turn wrongs into rights. However, by the time Jaskier found Geralt, he and the other witchers were in a battle with the Deathless Mother and several basilisks. Fortunately, Ciri regained control of her body and sent the Deathless Mother through a portal to her home sphere.
Shaerrawedd.
Months later, in Ban Gleán, Jaskier is chased away by his lover Vespula after being unfaithful. From his balcony he throws several things at the bard, including a pair of men's pants that do not belong to him; apparently Vespula wasn't so particular about loyalty either. When he throws Jaskier's lute from the balcony, Prince Radovid manages to catch the instrument. Jaskier is overwhelmed when he realizes who he is. Radovid and Philippa assure Jaskier that Ciri would be fine in Redania. They try to hire him to bring them the princess. Minutes later, he meets Yarpen, who brings him a request from Geralt; We must set a trap for Rience in the convoy from Yarpen to Hagge. Jaskier will be Ciri's harmless companion to get her to safety. Jaskier isn't exactly thrilled at the prospect of seeing his former tormentor again.
While camping in the ruins of Shaerrawedd, Rience and the Scoia'tael arrive. Jaskier carries the wounded from the battlefield to safety; his shoulder and lute are hit by an arrow. He fears dying and wishes that his archenemy Valdo Marx would not sing at his funeral. However, when Geralt assures him that he will survive and Yarpen and Ciri praise him for his bravery, he laughs in relief.
Jaskier reunites with Radovid and Philippa and apparently agrees to their demands. However, he demands that in exchange they must kill Rience for him.
Rience's whereabouts.
Jaskier accompanies Geralt to visit Codringher and Fenn, seeking information about Rience's whereabouts and who would be supporting him. The detectives give them information that Rience had been rejected as a mage, and that he works for a very powerful sorcerer. They also say that Istredd was here looking for information about Ciri. After speaking with the detectives, Geralt left Jaskier to investigate at Vuilpanne Castle. Meanwhile Jaskier went to Redania, looking for Radovid, he asks for some of his money to get more information from the detectives and tell who the magician is who is supporting Rience. Radovid says he will try to investigate him and his henchmen.
Helping a young woman.
Jaskier went to stay with his lover Vespula for a while, still thinking about Rience and what he was hiding, before hearing a knock to the door hearing that it is Geralt. He discovers that Geralt found a young girl in the castle, (who she believes is Ciri) was part of an experiment and the only survivor. They decide to take her to Anika, a friend of Geralt's mother, to find out if it is an enchantment. They arrive at Anika's house in the forest, meeting Otto. While Anika examines the fake Ciri, Jaskier talks to Otto, who confesses to being a werewolf, bitten during the plague of 1221, who had met Geralt hired by the villagers to kill him, although instead he gave him a cure that prevents him from being a werewolf.
Anika says the girl was under a mind control spell, they give her an extraction elixir made by Otto to know who was responsible for this. Outside the house, Jaskier and Geralt talk about the deal Jaskier made with Philippa, he tells her about a deal to take Ciri to Redania with King Vizimir, Ciri is a princess and not a witch or sorceress. Back inside, Geralt wakes up the fake Ciri, despite Anika's warnings. The young woman calls herself Teryn, while Jaskier listens to her, she tells that the origin is an origin of magic, she says that a man had taken her from her room. But when the elixir's effects are altered, Teryn casts a spell that removes Otto's necklace and causes him to attack like a werewolf. Jaskier grabs Teryn and manages to take her off and return her to Otto, putting the young woman to sleep.
Babysitter.
After leaving Teryn in Anika's care, he travels with Geralt to Aretuza on a ferry, meeting Ciri, wondering how Geralt's lessons of smiling. The captain of the ferry, Obin, does not want to take them, due to a monster lurking in the lake, Geralt and Ciri make a deal with the old man to kill the monster in exchange for taking them and he gladly accepted it. On board, Jaskier, to his surprise and chagrin, encounters his rival Valdo Marx and his gang. Jaskier and Valdo Max talk, noting that Valdo and his band were playing at Aretuza's dance and he wasn't invited, but Jaskier doesn't care, he got a very important job done for Yennefer. The musicians begin to sing, drawing the attention of the aeschna and attacking the ferry and the passengers. Everyone prepares, including Jaskier, Geralt and Ciri fight the monster and Ciri manages to kill him for the skull.
Greeted by Yennefer, she asks him to take care of Ciri tonight, Jaskier takes her with him to let Geralt and Yennefer talk alone. They start spying on them, imitating them and inviting what they say, laughing and watching them kiss. In a cabin they start playing cards before going to sleep, then Jaskier hears a noise in another cabin, meeting Radovid again, he tells him his feelings and they kiss.

Renfri (b. 1213 - d. 1231) was a princess and the daughter of Fredefalk, the prince of Creyden, and the stepdaughter of Aridea. She swore vengeance on Stregobor after he attempted to have her assassinated.
Biography.
Child of the Black Sun.
Renfri crosses paths with a witcher, Geralt of Rivia, in a Blaviken tavern. She calls her guards off and buys him a drink. She questions what brings him to Blaviken and remarks that he's in need of new clothes.
Later, Renfri tracks Geralt down outside Blaviken and demands to know where to find Stregobor so that she may kill him for the injustices she suffered, claiming that Stregobor's man raped her and robbed her before letting her go. Stregobor had attempted to persuade Geralt into killing her, but he turned down the offer, just as he turns down Renfri's ultimatum to kill Stregobor lest she slaughter the entire town. After talking, Geralt manages to talk Renfri into realizing that she wouldn't truly become the monster he claims her to be so long as she does not kill him, and he advises Renfri to leave Blaviken and finally live her life.
Renfri follows Geralt back to his camp, where he recounts his first monster kill with Roach, his horse. That was the day he realized the world didn't need him and that he would only ever be seen as a monster in humanity's eyes. Renfri questions what Geralt believes in, as it is neither destiny nor the lesser evil, but Geralt simply kills monsters. There are no sides. Renfri then claims to have decided to leave Blaviken for good tomorrow. She kisses Geralt and they have sex.
Despite her claims of leaving Blaviken behind and ending her pursuit of Stregobor, Renfri returns to town intent on slaughtering her way through Blaviken until she finds him. Renfri takes Marilka hostage and holds a blade to her throat. Geralt warns Renfri to leave Blaviken, displaying magic as a means to threaten. However, Renfri claims magic has no effect on her, only silver, such as with monsters. Renfri then releases Marilka and attacks Geralt, cutting him several times before Geralt manages to disarm her, leaving her with only a dagger to combat him with. Geralt lowers his sword, presenting her with an opportunity to attack, however, he evades her attack and stabs her in the throat with her own dagger. As Renfri bleeds out in Geralt's arms, she reminds him of his destiny and that the "girl in the woods" will be with him always.
Geralt mounted Renfri's cloak brooch onto the hilt of his Steel sword and carried it with him for years after, both as a keepsake of her and a reminder to himself not to become involved in conflicts between humans.

Stregobor (b. 786) was a wizard and a master illusionist, as well as a staunch believer in the "Curse of the Black Sun".
Biography.
Sometime during Falka's infamous rebellion, Stregobor got caught up in the conflict and witnessed firsthand the destruction it caused on the mages at Mirthe. Stregobor, while he survived the rebellion, lost both his hands in a fire, leaving behind charred stumps where his hands once were. As a result, he resorted to illusions to make it look like he still had hands and to hide the injuries.
Sometime later, he became one of the heads of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and by 1206, was the rector at Ban Ard Academy, where he became a mentor to Istredd. This turned out to be fruitful for Stregobor as, Istredd, not realizing how much his mentor depised elves and mixed people, revealed to Stregobor that Yennefer was a quarter-elf, a secret she had closely guarded. In turn, Stregobor revealed this information to the rest of the Brotherhood to deny assigning Yennefer as Aedirn's mage advisor when she was set to graduate in 1210 and instead assign her to Nilfgaard. However, Yennefer managed to get back the position that was promised to her anyways, much to Stregobor's annoyance.
Dealing with Renfri.
Stregobor was a staunch believer in the Curse of the Black Sun, which was said to mark the imminent return of Lilit — the demon goddess of the night — whose sole purpose was to exterminate the human species. Lilit's path was to be prepared by 60 women wearing gold crowns, who would fill the river valleys with blood. So when an eclipse occurred in 1213 under which numerous girls were born, the mage studied them and tried to "cure" them by locking them in towers for safe keeping to run trials on, but each girl died under his tortuous experiments. This didn't deter Stregobor though, as he believed eliminating them was the lesser evil.
Most notably, he personally delivered Creyden's princess, Renfri, in the middle of the afternoon, under the Black Sun and knew for certain that she was the bringer of evil. In fear of Lilit's return, Stregobor tried to conduct experiments on her as child before eventually deciding she was too dangerous and dispatched someone to follow Renfri into the woods and kill her. However, they later found the henchman in the brush with Renfri's broach jammed in his ear. She disappeared shortly thereafter and didn't reappear for another two years. Fearing for his life and having realized Refri was now resistant to magic, Stregobor fled Creyden as she chased after him, seeking justice for what he did to her.
By 1231, Stregobor was hiding in the town of Blaviken, caught in a stalemate with Renfri who had tracked him down there with her own gang. Trying to find a way to have Renfri dealt with, Stregobor lured the witcher, Geralt of Rivia, to Blaviken with the help of his servant, Marilka, to hire him to assassinate Renfri. Stregobor explained his reasoning behind wanting to kill Renfri, regarding his belief in the Curse of the Black Sun and that it was for the "lesser evil" and what he did was justified to the girls and that Renfri wanted him dead for revenge. Despite Stregobor's offer and reasoning, Geralt noted he only killed monsters, and refused.
Despite refusing Stregobor's offer, Geralt was eventually forced into a fight with Renfri, killing her as a result. Stregobor came down to see the destruction left in her wake, and he ordered Marilka to bring him a cart so that they could take Renfri's corpse back to the tower for an autopsy but Geralt objected. Stregobor then tried to persuade the witcher that it was Renfri's mutation that allowed her to influence her followers. When Geralt refused to lower his sword, Stregobor realized that he must've been similarly influenced and directed attention to the men Geralt killed. This caused the townspeople, Marilka included, to revolt against Geralt. They threw stones at him, as Renfri predicted they would, until he left.
Conclave of Northern mages.
Stregobor was among many mages to attend the conclave at Aretuza. He, Artorius, and Tissaia led the conclave. Artorius and Stregobor had no desire to go to war with Nilfgaard. Especially not for Cintra, who rejected their mages for decades. However, Vilgefortz worried that more kingdoms would fall after Cintra as Nilfgaard wanted the entire continent. Rather than watching them fall, Tissaia wanted to help Cintra defeat Nilfgaard by convincing the kings to send their armies because if they didn't stop Nilfgaard now, more kingdoms would fall.
Fringilla arrived at the conclave and denounced any suspicion that Nilfgaard was planning to take over the continent. Under their new leader, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, Nilfgaard had strengthened trade and funded research. Fringilla believed that in taking Cintra, they had a chance of saving the continent. If the Northern mages wouldn't take sides, Fringilla asked that they at least stay out her way. Fringilla then pointed out that if not for Yennefer, she never would've been assigned to Nilfgaard, and it wouldn't be the empire it is today. Artorius joked that had they sent Yennefer to Nilfgaard as planned, It would still be a "shitty backwater." Yennefer admitted this was true. Instead of Nilfgaard, she went to a prized kingdom and did "fuck all for decades." She helped murderers and rapists keep their crown. If given an option, she'd vote to burn it all down. The mages put it to a vote. Unfortunately, most side with Stregobor and Artorius to allow Cintra to fend for themselves.
Torturing Yennefer.
Stregobor taught a class and told the tale of Falka, who was allegedly a power-hungry mutt of a girl who cried, "Death to all kings!" when Vridank spurned her elven mother. Bent on revenge, she slaughtered nobility, preyed on foolish followers, and incited rebellion to burn cities into the ground. All in the effort to reclaim power, though Istredd claimed this was false and that Falka was a girl forgotten by her family. She was trying to rightly recover her throne, but Stregobor pointed out that she was quarter elven just like Yennefer, and as they all knew, history had a way of repeating itself. Stregobor also claimed that he was there when Falka destroyed Mirthe and all the mages in it. Her violence etched in the stumps of his hands. Stregobor simply wanted to protect their institution from similar corruption.
After learning that Yennefer was alive and that she had returned to Aretuza a month after the Battle of Sodden Hill, Stregobor bound her to a chair and tortured her for answers, as he didn't trust her considering she was of elven blood and mysteriously went missing after the battle. When she admitted to being a prisoner of war and having been taken by Nilfgaard, he decided to dig further through her mind, but Tissaia intervened and reported him to the Brotherhood, where Stregobor reasoned that with Yennefer having survived fire magic, imprisonment by Nilfgaard and capture by elves, he didn't see it as unreasonable to suspect that she may have been turned. The Brotherhood agreed and decided to put her faith to the test by ordering Yennefer to kill Cahir, but she helped him escape instead.
Birth of an elven baby.
Stregobor and Artorius learned from Dijkstra that an elven baby had been born of a mage in Cintra, which they saw as a potential threat, but Tissaia and Vilgefortz had no intentions to act on unfounded prejudice and rumor, to which Dijkstra replied that today's gossip is next month's news. For instance, he heard that Triss had returned, which the Brotherhood was not aware of.

Fringilla Vigo was a Nilfgaardian sorceress and Artorius Vigo's niece, who was a master illusionist and inspired Fringilla to follow the same path.
Biography.
Ascension at Aretuza.
Fringilla is one of the initiates brought into Aretuza by a sorceress named Tissaia de Vries. She is among several other girls in the greenhouse, who much like herself can tap into chaos and perform magic. Tissaia explains the dangers of magic and how each one of them showed an aptitude for controlling it. She explains that they are conduits of chaos, though magic itself is the control of chaos. She has gathered them for a trial. Before each of them sits a flower and a stone. They are to lift the stone without touching it. Fringilla is the first initiate to lift the stone, however, as demonstrated, magic comes at a price. Only seconds after Fringilla lifts the stone does her hand rapidly age and shrivel up. There is a give and take with magic, as Tissaia demonstrates by lifting the stone, but with the flowers in hand to represent what is taken as they grow old and die. The other initiates follow her lead, with the exception of Yennefer, who is unable to move the stone at all.
Several weeks have passed since their trial with the flowers and stone. The initiates are taken to Tor Lara to bottle lightning. It's the most potent place on the continent, off-limits to everyone except to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. This latest trial is to test their ability to control the ultimate expression of chaos. Fringilla raises her bottle and captures the lightning.
Fringilla is one of several initiates to be officially initiated into the Brotherhood. During the ceremony, she telepathically tells Istredd that Yennefer decided not to come after being assigned Nilfgaard's monarch instead of Aedirn, where Fringilla has been assigned. Later, she accompanies King Virfuril at an Aretuzan ball, until Yennefer arrives completely transformed. King Virfuril quickly discards Fringilla in favor of Yennefer, and the two dance center floor. Fringilla is instead assigned to Nilfgaard.
Conquering Cintra.
Several years have passed since her ascension from Aretuza. After conquering Cintra, Fringilla searches for Queen Calanthe's body. They find her on the ground, buried under snow. One of Fringilla's comrades cuts a chunk out of Calanthe's arm and eats her flesh. Fringilla then guts him and is able to determine that Ciri is in Brokilon forest.
Fringilla confronts Mousesack. He claims to know how she was schooled and shaped, which doesn't reflect her current actions. Fringilla retorts that the White Flame made her who she is. Gave her a higher purpose. Mousesack could've had that too if only he realized that Cintra had to fall. Cahir, the Black Knight, returns with a shape-shifter known as a doppler. He takes on Mousesack's appearance before killing him.
Cahir murdered everyone inside the tavern to insure they weren't the doppler, who took his form and attacked him in an attempt to gain possession of Ciri. As Fringilla cleaned his wound, he remarked that a simple test of silver would've sufficed. Fringilla stated that they could pull more soldiers and keep searching for Ciri. Fringilla reminded Cahir that it was he who rose up against the Usurper and helped free their people from their chains. She witnessed the White Flame crawl on him and anoint him. Ciri may be the key, but Cahir was the commissioner. They will find Ciri and spread the White Flame's supremacy throughout all kingdoms.
Conclave of northern mages.
Fringilla arrived at the conclave of Northern mages and denounced any suspicion that Nilfgaard was planning to take over the continent. Under their new leader, Emperor Emhyr, Nilfgaard had strengthened trade and funded research. They tore down walls while Queen Calanthe continued to put them up. Tissaia accused Fringilla of rejecting the order and way of life that took centuries to build. Tissaia retorted that they simply modified it. They took a new path, guided by the White Flame. When Triss claimed that Nilfgaard also forced mages into servitude and practice black magic, Fringilla responded that they believed in shared sacrifice and that there was no such thing as dark or light magic. Fringilla believed that in taking Cintra, they had a chance of saving the continent. If the Northern mages won't take sides, Fringilla asked that they at least stay out her way. Stregobor and Artorius were in favor of letting Cintra fend for themselves.
Fringilla pointed out that if not for Yennefer, she never would've been assigned to Nilfgaard, and it wouldn't be the empire it is today. Artorius joked that had they sent Yennefer to Nilfgaard as planned, It would still be a "shitty backwater." Yennefer admitted this was true. Instead of Nilfgaard, she went to a prized kingdom and did "fuck all for decades." She helped murderers and rapists keep their crown. If given an option, she'd vote to burn it all down. Tissaia wagered that Cintra was scared and suggested that they lend a hand. The mages put it to a vote. Unfortunately, most side with Stregobor and Artorius to allow Cintra to fend for themselves.
Battle of Sodden Hill.
After discovering that the Brotherhood was fortifying the keep, Fringilla reported back to Cahir to alert him of their arrival. The field Marshall recommended that they fall back, but Fringilla desired to move forward with the plan. This was their chance to honor the White Flame. Cahir refused to lose Princess Cirilla and ordered Fringilla to tests the Brotherhood's defenses.
Just up the mountain, Fringilla led the assault on Sodden Hill. She ordered her mages to keep attacking, but with each attack, the Brotherhood deflected. Fringilla then conjured up a small box to hand to a mage, who she ordered to draw the mages out.
Fringilla and Cahir watched from the top of the hill as their men were taken out by the brotherhood. They were forced to move to the other front. Fringilla guided eight of her own archers into a clearing in the woods, where she opened a portal that they fired arrows through, killing Vanielle and several others.
Tissaia confronted Fringilla in the woods. She offered her a way out if she would willingly returned to Aretuza. Fringilla laughed. She then explained that Nilfgaard was able to take Cintra after a horrible storm, where fifty Skelligen ships sunk to the bottom of the sea. Wrecked in a horrible fog caused by her. She then incapacitated Tissaia by throwing dimeritium in her face.
After breaking down the front line and taking out almost all of the Northern mages, Fringilla intercepted Yennefer's telepathic message. She told Yennefer to stop fighting and join Nilfgaard. However, Yennefer stayed true to her belief.
Fleeing Sodden.
After losing the Battle of Sodden Hill to Yennefer and the Brotherhood, Fringilla and what remained of her comrades, fled the area, but not before taking a depleted Yennefer with them as a prisoner of war, with the intent of offering her to the White Flame in hopes that he'd pardon her for the failure at Sodden.
Yennefer attempted to convince Fringilla to release her, even offering her a chance to join them and redeem herself. However, Fringilla insisted that what she was doing was in the name of liberation, which was the opposite of what they were taught at Aretuza. There, they were just sent out as pawns to guild kingdoms, nothing more.
As Fringilla and Nilfgaard prepared to pack up camp, her men were attacked by spears until only Yennefer and Fringilla remained standing.
Captured by elves.
Fringilla and Yennefer were taken prisoner by Filavandrel and his elven army, and introduced to their new leader, Francesca, who was often visited in her dreams by the "White Robed One" and put Fringilla to sleep after she failed to heed Filavandrel's warning to keep quiet. Francesca wasn't convinced they could be of any use to her and intended to have them killed and have their heads shipped back to Aretuza.
Yennefer noticed earlier that Fringilla was having a nightmare and asked what it was about, possibly someone hidden in a robe. A black robe, Fringilla confirmed, whereas Yennefer has dreamt of one in red while Francesca dreamed of one in white, which they shared with Filavandrel before being taken to a temple where runes of the Conjunction of the Spheres had been inscribed along the walls. There, Francesca revealed that the guide in her dream was Ithlinne, whereas Fringilla's was Emhyr. Yennefer then brushed away the dust on the altar to discover Elder speech. "Behold the mother of forests, the deathless mother, nesting in dreams." What remained was an incantation about a hut with no doors. Suddenly, the altar slid open and revealed a passageway, which Yennefer, Fringilla, and Francesca followed.
If Fringilla dreamt of Emhyr, Yennefer wondered why she was so terrified when she woke. Fringilla revealed that she was in the dark and there were people touching her. She couldn't see or touch them, so she laid there and let them. After the Usurper executed Fergus, he had all of the mages moved to prison. Fringilla was there for years when Emhyr found her and set her free.
Fringilla, Yennefer, and Francesca found the doorless hut in the woods and recited the incantation, causing the hut to turn in their direction and summon them inside, where Fringilla was approached by the Deathless Mother disguised as Emhyr, who offered her power and the means to achieve it -- by forging an alliance with Francesca and the elves.
Forging an alliance with Francesca.
Through her alliance with Francesca, Fringilla had turned Nilfgaard into a place of refuge for elves. However, some of her comrades weren't happy about it, especially General Hake, who disgruntledly revealed that they were harboring 4,000 elves, with more on the way. He feared they would interfere with Nilfgaard's mission, but Fringilla, who had taken control of Nilfgaard, claimed that the White Flame always found a way.
Fringilla arranged a meeting with Francesca to discuss the terms of their alliance. The elves were comfortable, but Francesca wanted to know what it would cost her, realizing that Nilfgaard needed a new army. Fringilla explained that they had no intentions of destroying the world, rather simply feed, house, and liberate those in need, and the elves just so happened to know the Continent better than any man. Francesca wanted a place for her people's future to begin and needed Fringilla to promise her that first.
Fringilla searched for an alternative after receiving word that guards had been boarding ships. She was making Francesca privy to this so that they could be instep together. This was a new experience for both of them, as they'd never had partners before. The next ship was due soon, and Francesca wanted her people to meet their liberator.
As the ship arrived, Fringilla discovered that Cahir was aboard and had made his way back to Cintra.
Cahir's return.
Fringilla and Francesca went on a walk through the garden, during which Francesca told Fringilla the story of how she and her brother killed their father, and a statue was made in her honor. At Aretuza, they were taught the art of politics and persuasion, to trick others into thinking they're in control, Fringilla revealed. Francesca suspected this of Fringilla's relationship with Cahir, as she was different when he was around. Francesca believed that it was time for her to put Cahir in his place, as he was no longer in power. Francesca then departed as Cahir joined them to explain to Fringilla that he understood that she was forced to make a difficult decision during such times, by aligning with the evles, but he knew her well enough to understand that she didn't forsake the mission given to them by the White Flame. And now it was time they returned to the reason they took Cintra in the first place, which was Ciri, who was last seen in Sodden.
Fringilla, Filavandrel, and a midwife were all at Francesca's side, coaching her through as she gave birth to her baby girl, though quiet for a moment, with some provided warmth from Fringilla, the baby was alive and well. Fringilla exited the room and informed the others waiting in the hallway that a new elf had been born.
Fringilla and Cahir watched as the elves celebrated the birth of a pure blood. Cahir could only remember one other time of such celebration: after the Usurper was overthrown and the people rose up. It took Fringilla a while to feel free, and now it was she who gave the elves hope. Cahir wondered what this would do to their alliance. What would happen when the elves decided they could repopulate on their own, without Nilfgaard's help. He then revealed that the White Flame wrote him and would be in Cintra any day now.
Seizing control of Nilfgaard.
Tension between Fringilla and Hake grew, as he didn't trust her or the elves. Not to mention, he feared that Redania had likely implanted a spy. While Cahir agreed with Fringilla that they needed to rebuild their army, he acknowledged Hake's concerns and intended to do so wisely. When he revealed that half the elves didn't even show up for training, Fringilla assured them that she would talk to them. With the White Flame's arrival tomorrow, Cahir would not have him met with chaos and insubordination. If the elves refused to serve, Cahir would like to deal with them, as the generals and White Flame would respect a strong hand.
Fringilla revealed to Francesca and Filavandrel that their fighters failed to show up for training. However, Filavandrel reveals had a change of heart. They never intended to fight for Nilfgaard. Francesca convinced him, but she'd now given him a far better reason not to fight. It was time for them to rebuild and grow strong again. While they were grateful for the home Nilfgaard provided in Xin'trea, they had no intentions of dying in someone else's war. As a friend, Francesca asked if these were Fringilla's words or Cahir's. The bargain they struck in that hut was working, Fringilla remarked. And it could remain that way so long as their bond remained strong. While she and Fringilla were friends, Francesca cherished the bond of family more.
Fringilla sought help from her uncle Artorius at Aretuza. She may need to leave Nilfgaard quickly. The White Flame was arriving tomorrow with great expectations. She brought in the elves to fight for Nilfgaard, but they'd had a change of heart. Blood being a bond stronger than all over, she pleaded with her uncle for help. He admitted that he should've stood up for her during the ball that night at Aretuza. Whatever was brewing, the Brotherhood needed reinforcement. If Fringilla were to return, she would have to plead her case, as well as apologize for believing that she could have any impact at all with Nilfgaard. Feeling belittled, Fringilla left to reconsider her options.
Fringilla poisoned Cahir and the generals with nightshade, which possessed paralytic qualities. She then killed every general seated at the table, a total of four of them. All that remained was Cahir, but she left him alive to tell Emhyr that the generals were killed for their treachery, as he trusted no one above Cahir.
Imprisoned by the White Flame.
Fringilla informed Cahir that Francesca and Filavandrel were gone with some of the elves to avenge their child, who had been murdered, likely by Redania. Cahir questioned why Francesca was so important to her, realizing that she was the key to Fringilla's plan to show the White Flame that she was a valuable leader. Cahir proposed that they lie to the White Flame and inform him that they killed the elven child and blamed Redania in order to gain the elves' allegiance.
Emperor Emhyr had finally arrived in Cintra. Fringilla and Cahir explained that while the elves may not wear their colors, they were doing Nilfgaard's bidding. He questioned how they convinced the elves to fight. They did so by killing Francesca's baby and blaming Redania. However, Emhyr knew that they were lying as it was he who ordered the death of the elven baby, as it was the best path to helping him find his daughter, Ciri. He then ordered for Cahir and Fringilla to be taken away.
Imprisonment and escape.
Having lost the emperor's trust, Emhyr had Fringilla imprisoned and forced to act as a food taster alongside other prisoners, sampling wine that was placed before them to prevent the emperor from being potentially poisoned. Shackled and powerless to use her magic, she tried at one point to refuse to take a sip but was then struck by a guard, forcing her to comply.
Some time later, after mentioning her fall from power to one of the other prisoners and remarking she'd play it smarter once she got out, the prisoner informed him nobody got out except death via a poisoned drink. As the prisoner noted this, he took a sip of the drink before him and died right after, revealing it was poisoned. Fringilla called out to the guards that another one was dead and the guard threw over a cloth bag for the still alive prisoners to wrap up the body themselves. Formulating a plan, Fringilla faked her own death and had herself wrapped up as a dead body. The guards proceeded to throw her down a hill where the other bodies had been tossed and, once the guards were gone, the sorceress freed herself from her wrappings. She then headed off, eventually making her way to a tavern. There, she appeared to be keeping low while enjoying the nightly entertainment.
However, one night she overheard the owner discussing with another how he won't be getting any ale delivered as normal due to the mages calling for another conclave and even if they tried other routes, they're all unsafe, particularly as boats are going missing. This piqued Fringilla's interest who butted into the conversation and asked about the boats.
Attack on Aretuza.
Fringilla devises a plan to find a new home for herself and the elves, using Ciri's powers to other spheres, betraying the Emperor, and Fringilla ends up killing her uncle during the Conclave battle and escapes with Francesca to Nilfgaard. However, Francesca does not want her people in an unknown sphere made by a girl with powers, instead she decides to accept Emhyr's deal. Fringilla doesn't want her to accept it, and she ends up confessing the truth that it was Emhyr who ordered her baby to be killed and tried to frame her for it.

Triss Merigold was a Temerian sorceress who enlisted in the help of Geralt of Rivia to cure the princess of Temeria.
Biography.
Saving the princess.
Triss Merigold sought out the help of Geralt of Rivia, a renowned witcher, as Temeria was terrorized by a creature of unknown origin. She served King Foltest, but was acting under her own agenda to keep the nations stabilized. Rather than kill the beast, she wanted Geralt's help in saving it.
Six years ago, stable hands started vanishing at the castle above the city. Before long, citizens started disappearing throughout all of Temeria. They soon realized that the creature was coming from the crypt within the castle, where the king's sister Queen Adda was laid to rest. Rumor has it that she was having an affair with a young man in town when she died and that she was with child, making that child sole heir to the Temerian empire. The king fled the castle ignoring the rising death toll. So, Triss was sent 3 months ago to kill the creature.
In order to determine what exactly they're faced against, she takes him to the tomb to examine the corpses of the victims of the creature. He examines Remus' corpse and comes to the conclusion that she covered up his death to hide the fact that the creature bested a witcher. Upon further examination, Geralt discovers that Remus is missing both his heart and liver. Only a striga's eating habits are that selective. They're very rare and can only be created through a curse, meaning someone wanted Adda dead. However, the curse didn't stop with Adda, and it turned her daughter into a monster, meaning the striga is the Princess of Temeria.
Triss Merigold takes Geralt to see King Foltest, Lord Ostrit, and Captain Segelin, with whom she pleads to enlist in Geralt's help. However, Segelin is skeptical of Geralt's claims that Princess Adda was murdered. Triss hopes that the king will allow her to search the abandoned castle for clues as to who killed Adda, however, Segelin fears that Geralt will kill the princess. Geralt explains that the creature grew inside of Adda, feeding on her womb and mutating, growing for years until she got so hungry that she was forced to "slither out," essentially an "overgrown abortion." This incenses the king, who orders everyone to leave.
Disregarding the king's orders, Triss and Geralt hide outside the abandoned castle and crypt. She asks if he's going to kill the striga, to which Geralt replies that he doesn't want the miners' coins. He and Triss proceed to sneak into the castle, where they discover letters from the former queen of Temeria in Adda's bedroom. The letter details Queen Sancia urging her children to end their affair. Geralt and Triss take this discovery to Ostrit under the suspicion that the former queen cursed her children. Ostrit claims that he was Adda's confidant and protector. He believes that Foltest raped Adda and cursed the child to cover it up. However, according to Geralt, Ostrit's scent was all over Adda's sheets. Old ones and new ones. He smelled what Ostrit was doing in there. With that, Ostrit confesses to being Adda's lover and placing the curse on her, albeit unintentionally. Geralt asks how to lift the curse, but Ostrit refuses to tell him, as he wants to see Foltest punished for defiling Adda. In response, Geralt simply knocks him out with a single punch.
Triss uses this information to convince the king into accepting Geralt's help. That night, Geralt enters the castle and the striga awakens. This results in an overnight battle between the two, ending with Geralt lifting the curse. However, in his attempt to help the young girl, she turns around and slices his throat with her claws. He bites her neck to get her off of him and passes out from blood loss.
Geralt awakens shortly after being healed by Triss. She informs him that the princess is fine and that King Foltest issued a statement that Lord Ostrit gave his life defeating the creature. The miners are even building a statue in his honor. Triss asks about Renfri, whose name Geralt uttered repeatedly while sleep. He doesn't reply, simply asking for his money. She asks if all life is to him is monsters and money, and he claims that it is. She doesn't believe that, and claims that there is a "vortex of fate" around each of them, drawing their destiny closer with each decision they make. Triss hands him his money and returns the gift he left for the princess.
Conclave of northern mages.
Triss Merigold was one of many mages who attended the conclave of Northern mages in Aretuza. Artorius, Stregobor, and Tissaia led the conclave. Artorius and Stregobor had no desire to go to war with Nilfgaard. Especially not for Cintra, who rejected their mages for decades. Rather than watching them fall, Tissaia wanted to help Cintra defeat Nilfgaard. Sabrina, Vilgefortz, and Vanielle sided with Tissaia, wanting to convince the kings to send their armies because if they didn't stop Nilfgaard now, more kingdoms would fall.
Fringilla arrived at the conclave and denounced any suspicion that Nilfgaard was planning to take over the continent. Under their new leader, Emperor Emhyr, Nilfgaard had strengthened trade and funded research. Tissaia accused Fringilla of rejecting the order and way of life that took centuries to build. Fringilla retorted that they simply modified it. They've taken a new path, guided by the White Flame. When Triss claimed that Nilfgaard also forced mages into servitude and practice black magic, Fringilla responded that they believed in shared sacrifice and that there was no such thing as dark or light magic. Fringilla believed that in taking Cintra, they had a chance of saving the continent. The mages put it to a vote. Unfortunately, most side with Stregobor and Artorius to allow Cintra to fend for themselves.
Battle of Sodden Hill.
Approximately 60 mages, Triss, Yennefer, Tissaia, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Sabrina included, board a ship headed for Sodden Hill. They must get to the Elven keep that guarded it before Nilfgaard did. They had already sent word to the Northern kingdoms. Temeria and Kaedwen agreed to join them in defending the land. The plan was to protect the keep. Triss, Yennefer, Tissaia, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Sabrina arrived at the keep. The only thing separating Nilfgaard from the North. They were greeted by a man. Yennefer advised him to take the children and hide, but as he explained, there was no more hiding from Nilfgaard. Their only chance was to fight.
Yennefer recalled Triss spending time in Temeria and asked if she truly believed that King Foltest would bring the Northern armies. Triss trusted that he would come through after she and Geralt helped save his daughter, who was cursed as a striga.
The keep was attacked by Fringilla and Nilfgaard in the late hours of the night. The sun had risen and the Northern mages made it through the night. Unfortunately, Nilfgaard arrived much sooner than they anticipated and the Northern armies were still a ways out. There were only 22 of them left, Triss, Yennefer, Tissaia, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, Atlan Kerk, and Sabrina included. They witnessed as a thick fog consumed the mountains around them, signaling Nilfgaard's encroachment. Tissaia ordered Sabrina to take the villagers to the artillery room while she and Triss head down. Yennefer was instructed to keep watch on the tower and reserve her chaos.
Tissaia guided Triss to an open field, where she proceeded to make mushrooms grow out the ground that when inhaled, its gases caused the Nilfgaardians to die. She then barricaded the front gate with vines to prevent Nilfgaard from penetrating. While protecting the gate from the Nilfgaard army, Triss was burned in the chest by a fire torch, which also allowed for Nilfgaard to burn through her vines forged around the door.
Battle scars.
Triss was left badly wounded and burned from the Battle of Sodden Hill. She was taken back to Aretuza, where her condition worsened, and she began to have a seizure until Tissaia, Vilgefortz, and Artorius intervened and managed to stabilize her.
Triss and Sabrina joined Yennefer by the pool following her return to Aretuza. However, Triss wasn't comfortable showing her burn wounds yet and remained by the poolside, where she recalled the Battle at Sodden and how when she was on the ground screaming, and Yennefer walked by her, she remembered thinking that if only one of them got to live, she was glad it was Yennefer, who offered to find a cure for Triss' scares, but she didn't appear too concerned, telling Yennefer, "What's lost is lost." She was just thankful not to be on Tissaia's plaque.
Training Ciri.
Triss traveled to Kaer Morhen at Geralt's request to help Ciri gain a better control of her magic. However, doing so would prove difficult, as according to Geralt, Ciri hadn't exhibited any typical indicators of Chaos. She only seemed to have the power of foresight, as well as a pull that led them to a leshy, leading Geralt to suspect that the creatures could've been sent by a mage to come after Ciri. So, Triss performed a test to determine any signs of mutagenic alchemy, but they wouldn't have results until morning. At that moment, Triss showed her feelings for Geralt, and until then, Triss proposed that she and Geralt stay the night together, but he turned her down.
The next day, after noticing how Lambert and Coen booed Ciri for her flower in her hair, Triss scolded them for the way they treated her. Triss takes Ciri to the laboratory. While there was no evidence of mutagenic alchemy in the monster Geralt killed, Triss did uncover stellacite from a monolith. Inside the leshy that turned Eskel, they uncover more stellacite, suggesting they came from the same monolith. It was then that Ciri revealed that when Nilfgaard attacked Cintra, she screamed and caused a monolith to topple, which Geralt decided to investigate for himself.
Triss handed Geralt his elixirs as he prepared to leave and investigate the destroyed monolith outside of Cintra. Regarding the night before, Geralt explained that he couldn't give her what she wanted or deserved, but for her, he was all that she was looking for last night. His pain excited her because she finally felt something again. Most of them were cured after the battle, but all wounds could not be healed, like her burns. Geralt hoped that in her search to feel again, she'd find her value to him, as she was important to him. Triss then portalled Geralt to Istredd, who was an expert on monoliths.Later, Vesemir shows Triss a ancient flower known as feainnewedd, found in the training ground where Ciri bled. Triss explains that the feainnewedd only blooms where Elder Blood is spilled that was eliminated from the continent generations ago.
Perfoming Dol Durza.
Upon Ciri's consent and learning from Vesemir that Ciri had Elder blood, the primary component in creating more witchers, she assisted in creating a new batch of witcher mutagen. However, it wasn't until the mutagen was complete that Triss discovered Ciri's plan to become the first of the new witchers.
In an attempt to convince Ciri out of taking the mutagen, Triss proposed a different method to find out where Ciri's power came from by performing a Dol Durza, which roughly translated to Valley of the Soul, which allowed them to enter the deepest layer of Ciri's consciousness and uncover things that may be hidden, like genetic memories. They not only walked through Ciri's memories, but those of her mother and grandmother's as well. However, at some point, Triss realized that the Dol Durza wasn't functioning properly, but the breaking point wasn't until Triss was nearly killed by Lara Dorren, who referred to Ciri as the "Child of Elder blood, child of wrath," and claimed that she would bring death to the world. Triss and Ciri regained consciousness, and Triss cowers in the corner, terrified by the death and horror prophesized.
Confiding in Tissaia.
Triss and Vesemir both felt foolish for ever thinking that they could tame Ciri. Whatever was running through her veins and whatever they made from it was more dangerous than they knew. As if on cue, Rience invaded the den, attacked them both, and fled with the witcher mutagen made from Ciri's blood. After being attacked and discovering that the fire mage stole the mutagen, Triss fled to Aretuza, where she revealed to Tissaia, who she trusted above anyone else, that a drop of Ciri's blood could change the world. And in the wrong hands, she would destroy it.
Triss learned from Tissaia that she saw Geralt with Ciri at Sodden, but Tissaia didn't know who she was at the time, and they had come looking for Yennefer. Tissaia then asked who else knew about what Triss saw when she performed the Dol Durza on Ciri. No one outside of them and the other witchers, Triss revealed. Before they could continue, Vilgefortz interrupted after having learned the truth from Tissaia and demanded to know everything about Ciri. Triss viewed this as a betrayal and exited without saying another word.

Eist Tuirseach became the king of Cintra after his impromptu marriage to Queen Calanthe.
Biography.
Royal betrothal.
In the past, Eist Tuirseach and his nephew Crach an Craite attend the royal betrothal. Hidden from all those who attend, Eist has secretly arranged with Queen Calanthe that Crach marry her daughter Princess Pavetta, as their union is the key to Cintra having power after the queen dies.
As he prepares Crach to claim Pavetta's hand in marriage, Lord Urcheon of Erlenwald interrupts the ceremony. His face hidden under knight's armor, he's come to claim Pavetta's hand in marriage. Eist proceeds to knock his helmet off, revealing a monstrous form. Queen Calanthe then orders Geralt to kill him, but he refuses, stating that Urcheon is no monster. He's a man that's been cursed.
Queen Calanthe orders her guards to slay Urcheon anyway, but he disarms the guards and explains to Queen Calanthe that Pavetta belongs to him under the Law of Surprise. Ignoring him, more of the queen's guards attack until Geralt comes to Urcheon's defense. Together, the two of them dispatch of Queen Calanthe's guards with little difficulty. A fight then breaks out amongst the guests, forcing Eist to intervene to hold them at bay until Queen Calanthe stands center room and commands the fighting to end.
Pavetta greets Duny, her secret lover for over a year. He was cursed as a young boy, and lived his whole life in misery until the day he saved Queen Calanthe's former husband, King Roegner from certain death. By tradition, he chose the Law of Surprise as payment for the deed. Hearing this, Eist pushes for Queen Calanthe to honor the tradition; destiny has determined the surprise be Pavetta. Initially Duny had abandoned all hope of claiming the Law of Surprise when he heard the king returned to find a child on the way. He knew no woman could accept him as he is, so he waited until the twelfth bell when the curse breaks. He never intended to meet Pavetta, only watch from afar, but destiny intervened and they fell in love. Both Eist and Mousesack advise Queen Calanthe to honor destiny's wish. The debt must be paid or the order of the world falls apart. Queen Calanthe seems to accept destiny, handing over her sword and extending her hand to Duny. She pulls him close, whispers "here is your destiny," and pulls out a knife aimed at his throat. Pavetta screams out and suddenly her abilities awakens, sending everyone flying across the room. Pavetta and Duny float above the room until Geralt knocks them down.
Queen Calanthe announces that the Law of Surprise will be honored and Pavetta will marry Duny. Furthermore, she herself has agreed to marry Eist. There will be two vows tonight. Pavetta and Duny kiss, and he transforms back into his human form. The queen's blessing of their marriage lifted the curse and fulfilled the destiny. Duny wishes to repay Geralt for saving his life, so Geralt chooses the Law of Surprise. Although he doesn't actually intend to lay claim to anything, Pavetta suddenly throws up, signifying that she's pregnant moments after Geralt claims Law of Surprise.
Imprisoning Geralt.
Just days prior to the attack on Cintra, Eist escorted Geralt out of the castle after he returned to claim his Child Surprise. Geralt recalled when Eist honored the Law of Surprise. Eist explained that was before he had a granddaughter. Assuming Cintra was attacked by Nilfgaard, Eist would be right by Calanthe's side. Geralt accused him of putting too much faith in the queen, but he wasn't there when Pavetta died. Calanthe would wake up howling in the night. The Lioness, nearly broken. Someone that was able to pull themselves out of that would have Eist's confidence until his final day. He asked Geralt to promise that he wouldn't come back. When Geralt refused, Eist trapped him behind bars.
Defending Cintra from Nilfgaard.
King Eist and Queen Calanthe hosts a knight induction ceremony with their granddaughter, Ciri. Afterward, they attend a celebratory feast, where King Eist, Queen Calanthe, and Mousesack discuss the encroachment of Nilfgaard. Should they fall, Ciri will rise to throne. Calanthe insists that they won't fall as there won't be a war, but with Ciri being so persistent to know more, Calanthe gives Ciri her first lesson; "as in life, it's impossible to be fully prepared for battle." She's to keep her sword close and keep it moving. King Eist and Queen Calanthe then get word of Nilfgaard's arrival.
Just outside Cintra, King Eist and Queen Calanthe are forced to combat the Nilfgaardian invaders in a field as opposed to waiting for aid from their fleet of ships that was delayed by the storm. The Nilfgaardians' sheer force in numbers allow them to overwhelm the Cintran army. Queen Calanthe is then forced to retreat after King Eist is killed in battle by an arrow in the eye from Cahir.

Mousesack was a skilled and intelligent druid, as well as a good friend and advisor to Queen Calanthe of Cintra.
Biography.
Royal betrothal.
Mousesack became an advisor to Duke Eist Tuirseach of Skellige, and accompanied Eist and his nephew Crach an Craite to the betrothal party in Cintra for Princess Pavetta's hand in marriage. During the celebration, he was delighted to recognize his old friend Geralt of Rivia among the new arrivals and pulled him aside to share gossip on the political machinations behind the party.
As the evening progressed, a knight by the name of Lord Urcheon of Erlenwald interrupts the ceremony. Queen Calanthe ordered the "beast" killed, but Geralt came to his defense. Mousesack advised Queen Calanthe to honor destiny's wish, but she takes it upon herself to kill Urcheon even after discovering that he was in love with her daughter and had claim to her under the Law of Surprise. Calanthe pulls him close, whispers "here is your destiny," and pulls out a knife aimed at his throat. Pavetta screams out and suddenly her abilities awaken, sending everyone flying across the room, Mousesack included. Pavetta and Duny float above the room until Geralt knocks them down. Realizing the error of her ways, Calanthe decides to honor the Law of Surprise and, in doing so, Calanthe also incidentally frees Urcheon of his curse. Duny, thankful to Geralt for saving his life, asks what Geralt wishes for as payment and Geralt chooses the Law of Surprise just before Pavetta throws up, signifying that she's pregnant.
Mousesack intends to stay and help guide Pavetta. He attempts to convince Geralt to stay as well, pointing out her immense primal power. Like it or not, Gerald is bound to the child. Mousesack advises him against trying to out run destiny. Geralt, however, doesn't believe in destiny, crediting Pavetta's outburst to a girl using her magic to stop her mother from gutting her lover. Nonetheless, the bond that will come to be between Geralt and Pavetta's unborn child will be extraordinary. Mousesack insists that if he dismisses it and leaves without claiming the child of surprise, he will unleash "true calamity" upon them all. Geralt is unconvinced and decides to take his chances.
Protecting Princess Ciri.
Following the knight induction ceremony, Mousesack, Queen Calanthe, and King Eist host a celebratory feast, where they discuss the encroachment of Nilfgaard. Should they fall, Princess Ciri will take the throne. Calanthe insists that they won't fall as there won't be a war, but with Ciri being so persistent to know more, Calanthe gives Ciri her first lesson; "as in life, it's impossible to be fully prepared for battle." She's to keep her sword close and moving. Queen Calanthe, King Eist, and Mousesack then get word of Nilfgaard's arrival.
Mousesack and Sir Lazlo lock Ciri in her room and watch over her while the king and queen lead an army into battle against Nilfgaardian invaders. Lazlo reveals that protecting her is his highest honor. Mousesack tells Ciri the tale of how sorcerers used to lock little girls up in towers because the girls were said to announce the end of the human race, and so they were systematically killed. She asks Mousesack if her grandmother will be alright. He replies that she, Ciri, will be alright.
After several days away at battle, Queen Calanthe returns, but without the king, who died in battle. The queen is wounded, and Cintra is under attack. Calanthe assures Ciri that one day she will rule Cintra. As the Nilfgaardians reach the gate, Mousesack creates a magical barrier around the citadel.
As night falls, the Nilfgaardians breach the castle gates. In the face of defeat, Queen Calanthe orders the entire castle to commit suicide by poison, to spare them the fate of being tortured and murdered by the invading army. Calanthe will stay behind, but she is sending Ciri off with Sir Lazlo and Mousesack, telling her to find Geralt of Rivia, as he is her destiny. On her way out, Ciri screams, causing a magical pulse. With Ciri being escorted out, Calanthe reveals to Mousesack that Ciri is the reason Nilfgaard attacked.
Mousesack, Sir Lazlo, and Ciri escape the castle through an underground tunnel. Mousesack stays behind to fend off invading Nilfgaardians.
Present day, Mousesack has been captured by the Nilfgaardian invaders. As he is being pulled by a chain, he trips over Queen Calanthe's body. He grabs the cloth off her body and hides it under his shirt.
Evil doppler.
After being captured by the Nilfgaardians, Mousesack is brought before Cahir, who has enlisted in the help of a doppler to help recover Princess Ciri from Brokilon forest. Cahir orders the doppler to take on Mousesack's appearance. Cahir releases Mousesack from his chains only for the doppler to tackle him to the ground and shape shift into him, before stabbing Mousesack with a knife. After killing him, Cahir demands that Ciri is brought to him alive.

Pavetta (b. 1234 - d. 1257) was the princess of Cintra, daughter of Queen Calanthe and King Roegner, and the mother of Ciri.
Biography.
Sometime prior to 1249, Pavetta met a man named Duny and the two instantly fell in love, even after she learned he was cursed and had a hedgehog-like head during the day. However, her mother, Calanthe, was set on uniting Cintra and Skellige, so when Pavetta turned 15 the queen held a betrothal party that, while many suitors were invited, it was clear Calanthe had already secretly arranged for Pavetta to marry Crach an Craite, despite the princess' numerous objections. Even as Pavetta tried to hold back from crying over this forced marriage during the banquet, remarking she could do better than Crach, Calanthe made it clear to her daughter that her feelings were of little concern as they needed the marriage to secure power for Cintra.
As the banquet continued, several of the suitors formally introduced themselves, such as Peregrine from Nilfgaard, but these were all dismissed by the queen as a reluctant Pavetta silently watched. While her mother talked with Geralt, who she'd invited to sit with them, a masked knight suddenly barged into the party and introduced himself as Lord Urcheon of Erlenwald and that he was there to ask for Pavetta's hand in marriage. As Pavetta looked on, Calanthe questioned why he hid his face and the knight explained it was due to a knightly vow to wait until midnight but Eist hastily knocked the helmet off, revealing a monstrous hedgehog-like head.
At this, Calanthe asked Geralt to kill the monster as Pavetta looked over at the witcher in horror, but Geralt refused, noting it was not a monster but a cursed knight. Incensed the witcher wouldn't do as asked, the queen then ordered her guards to kill Urcheon before the knight revealed Pavetta belonged to him through the Law of Surprise. As the Cintran guards attacked and disarmed Urcheon, one moved in to deal the final death blow as Pavetta cried out for them not to, but her cries went unheard as Geralt intervened, saving Urcheon. Calanthe then ordered for both Urcheon and Geralt to be killed but some, like Eist, suddenly came to their defense, noting the Law of Surprise had been called, and an all out brawl sprung up among the guests.
Having lost control of the situation, Calanthe entered the fray and managed to stop the fighting but, before more could be said, Pavetta ran over to Urcheon, revealing he was Duny and that the two had known each other before he introduced himself that night. Duny then revealed to the room that he had saved Roegner years ago and had claimed the Law of Surprise as payment, which turned out to be Pavetta, but when he heard Roegner had returned home to learn a child was on the way, Duny abandoned all hope of claiming the child. One night though after midnight, he still wished to see her from afar but destiny intervened and the two met and subsequently fell in love. As other guests remarked it was destiny and asked the queen to accept it, Pavetta spoke up, saying she loved Duny and would marry him. Hearing this, Calanthe handed over her sword and extended her hand to Duny as acceptance, but as he took her hand, the queen suddenly pulled out a hidden dagger and moved to stab his throat. Pavetta screamed out in horror at this betrayal, suddenly unleashing a magical shockwave that sent everyone else but Duny flying through the air, protecting Duny from being killed once again.
As her previously dormant powers emerged, creating a whirlwind around the pair, Pavetta began to speak in Elder Speech to Duny and they float up into the air, oblivious to the increasing destruction the whirlwind was causing outside their protective bubble. However, Pavetta was distracted by something out of the corner of her eye and looked over just as Geralt managed to throw a sign, knocking the two out of the air and stopping the whirlwind.
Having regained awareness, Pavetta and Duny were soon approached by Calanthe, who hugged her daughter before revealing she thought Pavetta's grandmother's gift had skipped her like it did with Calanthe, before admitting she'd apparently been wrong about that and many other things. Finally accepting destiny this time, Calanthe then announced to the room that Pavetta would marry Duny while Calanthe would marry Eist that night, thereby still securing an alliance with Skellige. The queen then performed Pavetta and Duny's ceremony, giving her blessing to their marriage. As the couple then kissed, Duny suddenly transformed back to his human form. While elated at this, Pavetta questioned how that was possible as it wasn't midnight yet, to which Mousesack noted that Calanthe's genuine blessing for them to be together must have lifted the curse.
As Geralt moved to leave, Duny called out to the witcher, asking what Geralt wanted as payment for saving his life. While Geralt tried to brush it off, not wanting anything, Duny insisted, not wanting to start his new life with a life debt. Still having no idea what to ask, Geralt claimed the Law of Surprise but stated he had no intentions of coming back for whatever it was. As he did so, Pavetta suddenly threw up, revealing to the group she was pregnant and thus the child would become Geralt's Child of Surprise.
Shortly after Pavetta gave birth to Ciri in 1250, word got to Duny and Pavetta of Ithlinne's Prophecy and that it was regarding their newborn daughter. Realizing people would try to kill Ciri if people started to believe it, Duny urged Pavetta that the young family needed to leave that night on a boat waiting for them. However, things went wrong and Duny and Pavetta died that night.

Tissaia de Vries was a sorceress and a member of the Chapter of the Gift and the Art. She's also the rectoress of Aretuza. She recruits young women who have conduit moments.
Biography.
Recruiting Yennefer.
Tissaia de Vries recruits the deformed Yennefer from her home town of Vengerberg after Yennefer unintentionally portals to Aretuza briefly. Tissaia finds Yennefer and purchases her from her abusive father. Her mother objects, though it goes without answer, as do Yennefer's cries for help. Yennefer is forcefully taken from her home in Vengerberg and locked in a room in Aretuza. Yennefer shatters the mirror in her room and grabs a shard of glass as she contemplates taking her own life.
Tissaia heals Yennefer after discovering she slit her wrists. Yennefer, however, states that she wishes she had died, claiming that "at least she would've had control over that". Tissaia retorts that Yennefer wasn't taking control, but rather was losing it.
Later, Yennefer is summoned to the Greenhouse by Tissaia. There, she joins a group of other young women, all possessing similar magical capabilities. Tissaia explains the dangers of magic to them and how each one of them showed an aptitude for controlling it, describing them as "conduits of chaos", and explains that magic itself is the control of said chaos. She directs their attention to the items before them: a flower and a stone. She explains that they are to lift the stone without touching it, using the phrase "Zelil Ape". One of the girls, Fringilla, manages to successfully lift the stone; however, only seconds after doing so, her hand rapidly ages and shrivels up while the girl screams in terror. Tissaia is unbothered by this, simply thanking Fringilla for the demonstration. She tells the girls that there is a give and take with magic, and proceeds to recite the incantation herself, this time with a flower in hand. She also successfully lifts the stone in front of her; but remains unaffected while the flower rapidly withers and dies. The remaining initiates then follow her lead, and are each able to lift their stones to varying degrees: with the exception of Yennefer, who is completely unable to move the stone in any manner. Tissaia coldly remarks to the young girl that "sometimes the best thing a flower can do for us is die", further disheartening Yennefer. Discouraged by her failed attempt, Yennefer flees the greenhouse.
Several weeks have passed since Yennefer's arrival in Aretuza, and the initiates now sit across from each other during an exercise to determine their partner's greatest fear. Telepathy should be taking place, however, after hours of analyzing her partner, Yennefer fails to determine her fear and lies to cover up her inadequacies. Tissaia immediately identifies it, calling Yennefer out and berating her in front of the class.
Tissaia later takes the initiates to Tor Lara to bottle lightning. It's the most potent place on the continent, off limits to everyone except to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. This latest trial is to test their ability to control the ultimate expression of chaos. After watching two initiates fail before her, Yennefer's up. She raises her bottle and fails; the lightning striking her and sending her across the room. Enraged by her own failures, Yennefer shoots the lightning at Tissaia, and she redirects it back into the sky. Tissaia relates to Yennefer. There are two types of mages. Those who can control their emotions and those who let their emotions control them, Yennefer and Tissaia being the latter. It's their job to control chaos, not become it.
Yennefer takes the flower she got from Istredd to Tissaia. This was a test orchestrated by Tissaia to see if Yennefer could control her emotions long enough to get it from him. She did so successfully, and Tissaia dismisses her, referring to Yennefer by her actual name rather than "Piglet." Yennefer asks if this means she's ready to "ascend." Tissaia tells Yennefer to listen for the knock.
Yennefer listens for the knock as instructed. However, it's not her door that Tissaia knocks on. Nevertheless, she takes the opportunity to spy on Tissaia as she turns three of the initiates into eels. Tissaia instructs her to push them into the water. Tissaia took away their control, but they still have power. They're conduits for Aretuza. So when Yennefer takes a broom and pushes them into the water, all of Aretuza lights up with magic.
Sending Yennefer to Nilfgaard.
Tissaia finds Yennefer with the enchanter in preparation for initiation. Tissaia tells Yennefer that they remake themselves on their own terms. Yennefer has the power to free the "victim in the mirror" forever. Tissaia instructs Yennefer to close her eyes and imagine the most powerful woman in the world. Yennefer opens her eyes and sees just that looking back at her in the mirror, if only for a brief moment, drawn from Yennefer's mind onto the mirror by Tissaia's magic.
The Chapter gathers to discuss their concern with Cintra refusing to use their mages. King Dagorad has banned mages from Cintra entirely, and although Stregobor has heard rumblings that the king is ill, assuming Princess Calanthe will be more inclined to accept their mages if he dies, but Tissaia is doubtful. Artorius asks what of Nilfgaard, and Stregobor criticizes King Fergus for squandering the kingdom's money on women while his people starve to death. Fringilla, Artorius' niece, will be in Nilfgaard by week's end, and Tissaia assures everyone that she will bring sanity and bread to the kingdom. However, Stregobor has little faith in her. Artorius suggests sending someone with a bit more "spine" to Nilfgaard, and Stregobor recommends Yennefer, since they'd be spitting in Dagorad's face to send her to Aedirn, Cintra's biggest trading partner. The only thing Cintra hates more than mages is elves, and Yennefer is a quarter-elf. Tissaia is very much against sending Yennefer to Nilfgaard, even accusing Artorius of nepotism for sparing his niece of her duties. The chapter puts it to a vote, and Tissaia is overruled; Yennefer is reassigned to Nilfgaard.
Tissaia is confronted by Yennefer, who demands an audience with the Chapter after discovering that she is being sent to Nilfgaard rather than Aedirn as promised. Tissaia reveals that it was her blood that finalized the Chapter's decision. Sending a quarter-elf to Aedrin would only further ostracize Cintra given their hatred for elves. It was Stregobor who told the Chapter about Yennefer's true father.
Tissaia, Artorius, Stregobor, and the rest of the Chapter gather to initiate the new recruits into the Brotherhood, which Yennefer does not attend following her reassignment. However, she does attend the Aretuzan ball completely transformed. King Virfuril discards Fringilla in favor of Yennefer, and the two dance center floor with Tissaia, Artorius, and Stregobor watching angrily.
A shot at redemption.
It's been over 30 years since they last spoke, but with Yennefer drawing unwanted attention, Tissaia decides to pay her a visit. Tissaia informs Yennefer that King Virfuril is dead. King Demavend rules now. Yennefer remained hidden for a while, but now she's making noise in search of a solution to her problem; she wishes to bear children. Tissaia has come to warn her, saying that the mages that Yennefer is enlisting won't help her because Yennefer is "pure chaos" at the moment. She wants a cure, and it's making her sloppy. The Brotherhood left her to her own devices after she abandoned Aedirn, but her recent behavior will make her a target. Tissaia invites Yennefer to return to Aretuza, but she turns Tissaia down. Yennefer suspects that Tissaia only wants to see her thrive so long as she has a hand in it. Tissaia swears this is not true. She questions what more Yennefer could want, to which she replies "everything."
Conclave of Northern Mages.
After discovering that Yennefer had returned to Aretuza, Tissaia confronts her as she attempts to poison the minds of three young initiates. Tissaia interrupted Yennefer's schooling of the girls and sent them to their rooms. She went on to tell Yennefer that she should stop with the one life she'd already ruined, that being her own. Yennefer never wanted to come back, referring to Aretuza as a joke. Letting in girls who couldn't even do magic. Tissaia explained that they had to make compromises in order to survive. Tissaia departed as an emergency conclave of the Northern Mages was called after Nilfgaard took Marnadal.
Tissaia, Stregobor, and Artorius led the conclave. Artorius and Stregobor had no desire to go to war with Nilfgaard. Especially not for Cintra, who rejected their mages for decades. Rather than watching them fall, Tissaia wanted to help Cintra defeat Nilfgaard. Sabrina, Vilgefortz, and Vanielle sided with Tissaia, wanting to convince the kings to send their armies because if they didn't stop Nilfgaard now, more kingdoms would fall.
Fringilla arrived at the conclave and denounced any suspicion that Nilfgaard was planning to take over the continent. Under their new leader, Emperor Emhyr, Nilfgaard had strengthened trade and funded research. Tissaia accused Fringilla of rejecting the order and way of life that took centuries to build. Tissaia retorted that they simply modified it. They'd taken a new path, guided by the White Flame. Nilfgaard believed in shared sacrifice and that there was no such thing as dark or light magic. Fringilla believed that in taking Cintra, they had a chance of saving the continent. If the Northern mages wouldn't take sides, Fringilla asked that they at least stay out her way. Tissaia wagered that Cintra was scared and suggested that they lend a hand. The mages put it to a vote. Unfortunately, most side with Stregobor and Artorius to allow Cintra to fend for itself.
Once the conclave concluded, Yennefer and Tissaia resumed their previous discussion. Tissaia insisted that there are girls who need the help that only Aretuza can provide. She also added that Yennefer was right back in Rinde when Tissaia visited her. But they had to put their differences aside to stop Nilfgaard. Tissaia, Vilgefortz, and some of the other mages were planning to fight, and she was hoping Yennefer would join them.
Battle of Sodden Hill.
Approximately 60 mages, Tissaia, Yennefer, Triss, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Sabrina included, board a ship headed for Sodden Hill. They must get to the Elven keep that guarded it before Nilfgaard did. They had already sent word to the Northern kingdoms. Temeria and Kaedwen agreed to join them in defending the land. The plan was to protect the keep. Tissaia, Yennefer, Triss, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Sabrina arrived at the keep. The only thing separating Nilfgaard from the North. They were greeted by a man. Yennefer advised him to take the children and hide, but as he explained, there was no more hiding from Nilfgaard. Their only chance was to fight.
Tissaia and Yennefer discussed Nilfgaard's encroachment and the need to enjoy the night while they could. Yennefer noticed that Tissaia had taken a liking to Vilgefortz. Tissaia looked to her and asked if she was ready to die should they fail to stop Nilfgaard. Yennefer claimed that she was, having lived several life times, none of which satisfied her, Tissaia remarked. Yennefer had accepted that life had no more to give. However, Tissaia argued that Yennefer still had more to give.
The keep was attacked in the late hours of the night by Fringilla and Nilfgaard. The sun had risen and the Northern mages made it through the night. Unfortunately, Nilfgaard arrived much sooner than they anticipated and the Northern armies were still a ways out. There were only 22 of them left, Tissaia, Yennefer, Triss, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, Atlan Kerk, and Sabrina included. They watched as a thick fog consumed the mountains around them, signaling Nilfgaard's encroachment. Tissaia ordered Sabrina to take the villagers to the artillery room while she and Triss head down. Yennefer was instructed to keep watch on the tower and reserve her chaos.
Yennefer telepathically communicated with the others to alert them of Nilfgaard's arrival. Tissaia guided Triss to an open field, where she proceeded to make mushrooms grow out the ground that when inhaled, its gases caused the Nilfgaardians to die.
Tissaia confronted Fringilla in the woods. She offered her a way out if she would willingly return to Aretuza. Fringilla laughed. She then explained that Nilfgaard was able to take Cintra after a horrible storm, where fifty Skelligen ships sunk to the bottom of the sea. Wrecked in a horrible fog caused by her. She then incapacitated Tissaia by throwing dimeritium in her face.
Tissaia woke up in the darkness to Yennefer's call, shivering and weak. She regrouped with Yennefer on the hillside. Tissaia had been severely weakened, but with the Northern armies close, Yennefer refused to give up. She looked Tissaia in the eyes and for the first time admitted that Tissaia saved her. It was Yennefer's turn to save the continent. Tissaia urged her to let her chaos explode. Yennefer got back to her feet, absorbed the fire that was consuming the keep and unleashed it all on the Nilfgaard army.
Aftermath of Sodden Hill.
In the aftermath of the Battle of Sodden Hill, Tissaia searched for Yennefer by looking through the memories of the fallen and observing their final moments. With thousands dead on all sides, Vilgefortz advised Tissaia to accept that Yennefer was gone, but she wouldn't give up on her, as she continued calling out to her protégé. However, instead of Yennefer, she crossed paths with Geralt and Ciri, who asked Tissaia if Yennefer was alive, but despite her efforts to find her, Tissaia was doubtful.
The mages returned to Aretuza, where they tended to their wounded, among them Triss, who suffered bad burns and was experiencing seizures, which they eventually managed to get under control.
Not only did they win the battle, they took a prisoner of war, that being Cahir, who Tissaia tortured for answers, using her Chaos to pick through his brain, a terribly painful experience, if Cahir's screams were any indication.
Yennefer's return.
Tissaia was practically speechless during a council meeting, with the surprise return of Yennefer, who many suspected of perishing during the battle. Tissaia waited a month before finally carving out the names on a plaque of those lost at the Battle of Sodden Hill. She was glad that it no longer included Yennefer's. Artorius could feel his hold on the council slipping and Stregobor was desperate, making him dangerous. Yennefer's actions turned the tide of the battle, and for that she was a hero to Tissaia and many others, but they needed to allow Vilgefortz to carry the mantle of victory because he and Tissaia were making a play for their council seats.
Tissaia intervened on Stregobor's unauthorized probing of Yennefer and presented his treason-like actions to the Brotherhood, where Stregobor reasoned that with Yennefer having survived fire magic, imprisonment by Nilfgaard and capture by elves, he didn't see it as unreasonable to suspect that she may have been turned.
In order to prove her loyalty, Tissaia revealed to Yennefer that the Brotherhood had decided she needed to kill Cahir. It would prove that Yennefer was not a spy, but she worried it would only prove she was a killer, which would be just another way for Stregobor to vilify her. If not kill him, Tissaia advised Yennefer to tell them the truth — that she was not a threat because she lost her magic. For a month, Yennefer searched the Continent, trying every herb, potion, and spell to get back what she deserves. Unfortunately, all Tissaia could say was that "What is lost, is lost." 
During Cahir's execution, Tissaia watched as Yennefer cut him free of his chains and helped him escape.
Hunting Ciri.
Tissaia received an unexpected visit from Triss, who revealed that Ciri had the power to either save the world or destroy it, as prophesized.
Tissaia stared out the window as Vilgefortz lied in bed, waiting for her to return. Something was clearly bothering her, but she didn't seek to burden Vilgefortz, who insisted they were partners in every way. And so, she reluctantly revealed they had an unexpected visitor, Dijkstra, from whom the Brotherhood learned that an elven baby had been born of a mage, which Artorius and Stregobor saw as a potential threat. However, Tissaia and Vilgefortz had no intentions to act on unfounded prejudice and rumor, to which Dijkstra replied that today's gossip is next month's news. For instance, he heard that Triss had returned, which the Brotherhood was not aware of, but Tissaia claimed she simply came back to recover after falling ill.
Tissaia revealed to Triss that she saw Ciri at Sodden. She was there with Geralt, but Tissaia didn't know who she was at the time, and they had come looking for Yennefer. Tissaia then asked who else knew about what Triss saw when she performed the Dol Durza on Ciri. No one outside of them and the other witchers, Triss revealed. Vilgefortz interrupted them after having learned the truth from Tissaia and demanded to know everything about Ciri. Triss viewed this as a betrayal, as she asked Tissaia not to tell anyone, and exited without saying another word. Tissaia blamed Vilgefortz for not heeding her warning and waiting until the time was right, but Vilgefortz saw this as a potential to end all war, because if she fell into the wrong hands, she could destroy the world. Vilgefortz always considered Tissaia his equal partner. He wished he could prove to her that he's equal of the same.
Tissaia attended a meeting with the Northern Kings and Queens of the Continent, during which she revealed that Ciri was alive and well, accompanied by a witcher. Tissaia recalled Dijkstra coming to Aretuza and suspected that he knew of Ciri's existence all along, with the goal of King Vizimir marrying her in order to claim Cintra. When Meve remarked that Ciri created far less trouble for them when she was believed to be dead, Tissaia and the Northern Kingdoms authorized a bounty on Ciri and anyone protecting her.
Celebration in Aretuza.
While training a new generation of sorceresses, Tissaia overheard a discussion from the Brotherhood complaining about the commotion in the northern kingdoms. Afterwards, he met with Yennefer in Gors Velen, seeing that Tissaia knew from the beginning that Cirilla was alive, and had told the kings of the north to gain her favor, since she was believed dead after the massacre of Cintra. Tissaia says that gaining their favor is no more insulting than freeing a Nilfgaardian prisoner. Yennefer regrets causing so much trouble. Yennefer tells him that there is a mage supporting Rience to find Ciri, she asks him for help to protect her and receive training in Aretuza. In the middle of the talk, Tissaia saw that after everything that had happened, Yennefer finally became a mother.
Tissaia found Ciri, along with Margarita and Sabrina who the latter wanted to punish her, thinking she was a fugitive from Aretuza, but Yennefer stopped this. Tissaia looks into her eyes without looking away before bleeding. Then she, along with the other sorceresses, go to "The Silver Heron", while the others spend their time talking about the witchers, Tissaia does not take her eyes off Ciri, from the stairs. She looks at him without saying anything, as Ciri doesn't like Margarita's kind of tone.

Sabrina Glevissig is a sorceress, as well as a member of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.
Biography.
Ascension at Aretuza.
Sabrina is one of the initiates brought into Aretuza by a sorceress named Tissaia de Vries. Sabrina joins the other girls in the greenhouse, who much like herself can tap into magic. Tiassai explains the dangers of magic and how each one of them showed an aptitude for controlling it, making them conduits of chaos, though magic itself is the control of chaos. She has gathered them for a trial. Before each of them sits a flower and a stone. They are to lift the stone without touching it. Fringilla is the first initiate to lift the stone, however, as demonstrated, magic comes at a price. Only seconds after Fringilla lifts the stone does her hand rapidly age and shrivel up. There is a give and take with magic, as Tiassai demonstrates by lifting the stone, but with the flowers in hand to represent what is taken as they grow old and die. Sabrina follows her lead, as do the other initiates, with the exception of Yennefer, who is unable to move the stone.
Several weeks have passed. The initiates are taken to Tor Lara to bottle lightning. It is the most potent place on the continent, off limits to everyone except to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. This latest trial is to test their ability to control the ultimate expression of chaos. Sabrina raises her bottle effortlessly captures the lightning. In her jealousy, Yennefer shoots lightning at Tissaia, who redirects it back into the sky.
Sabrina, along with her fellow initiates are officially initiated into the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. She stands before the Chapter and offers herself to them. She later attends the Aretuzan ball.
Conclave of northern mages.
Sabrina was one of many mages who attended the conclave of Northern mages in Aretuza. Artorius, Stregobor, and Tissaia led the conclave. Artorius and Stregobor had no desire to go to war with Nilfgaard. Especially not for Cintra, who rejected their mages for decades. Rather than watching them fall, Tissaia wanted to help Cintra defeat Nilfgaard. Sabrina, Vilgefortz, and Vanielle sided with Tissaia, wanting to convince the kings to send their armies because if they didn't stop Nilfgaard now, more kingdoms would fall.
Fringilla arrived at the conclave and denounced any suspicion that Nilfgaard was planning to take over the continent. Under their new leader, Emperor Emhyr, Nilfgaard had strengthened trade and funded research. Tissaia accused Fringilla of rejecting the order and way of life that took centuries to build. Fringilla retorted that they simply modified it. They've taken a new path, guided by the White Flame. When Triss claimed that Nilfgaard also forced mages into servitude and practice black magic, Fringilla responded that they believed in shared sacrifice and that there was no such thing as dark or light magic. Fringilla believed that in taking Cintra, they had a chance of saving the continent. The mages put it to a vote. Unfortunately, most side with Stregobor and Artorius to allow Cintra to fend for themselves.
Battle of Sodden Hill.
Approximately 60 mages, Sabrina, Yennefer, Tissaia, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Triss included, board a ship headed for Sodden Hill. They must get to the Elven keep that guarded it before Nilfgaard did. They had already sent word to the Northern kingdoms. Temeria and Kaedwen agreed to join them in defending the land. The plan was to protect the keep. Sabrina, Yennefer, Tissaia, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Triss arrived at the keep. The only thing separating Nilfgaard from the North. They were greeted by a man. Yennefer advised him to take the children and hide, but as he explained, there was no more hiding from Nilfgaard. Their only chance was to fight.
The keep was attacked by Fringilla and Nilfgaard in the late hours of the night. The sun had risen and the Northern mages made it through the night. Unfortunately, Nilfgaard arrived much sooner than they anticipated and the Northern armies were still a ways out. There were only 22 of them left, Sabrina, Triss, Yennefer, Tissaia, Vilgefortz, Vanielle, Coral, and Atlan Kerk included. They witnessed as a thick fog consumed the mountains around them, signaling Nilfgaard's encroachment. Tissaia ordered Sabrina to take the villagers to the artillery room while she and Triss head down.
Sabrina led the archers from within the castle. The villagers packed blue meteorite into bottles and launched them into the sky. Sabrina and the others shot the bottles with arrows, causing massive explosions, taking out the Nilfgaard army below.
At some point during the battle, Sabrina had been taken over by a kind of silver worm-like parasite that slithered into her ear, as well as the ears of two villager boys. She handed them two bottles of explosive blue meteorites. Sabrina sneaked up behind Yennefer and stabbed her in the abdomen with an arrow. The two young boys, also under the control of the parasites, took their bottles of blue meteorite and dropped them on the tables filled with blue meteorite, causing a massive explosion on both ends of the keep that sent Yennefer and Sabrina flying off the tower, though the former managed to stick the landing. The fall appeared to return Sabrina to her normal self as she apologized for attacking Yennefer.
After the Battle.
After Yennefer and Foltest's forces defeat the Nilfgaardian army at Sodden, the mages take the survivors back to Aretuza. Yennefer has lost her magic, so she cannot use any spell to heat the water in a pool. Sabrina and Triss join her. They are happy that Yennefer survived and exchange some friendly banter. Not knowing that Yennefer can no longer do magic, Sabrina heats the water and asks the others if they would go swimming with her. Triss refuses because her scars make her uncomfortable.
Sabrina is later present when Yennefer takes the Nilfgaardian prisoner of war Cahir to a memorial service honoring those killed on Sodden. Cahir was to be executed in front of the kings, but Yennefer frees him from his bonds and helps him escape.
Wizards Gathering in Thanedd.
Sabrina, Tissaia and Margarita meet Ciri in the Gors Velen market and mistake her for a fugitive from Aretuza. To apologize for the trouble, Yennefer invites them to "The Silver Heron". While bathing, Yennefer and Sabrina joke about the world of men in particular, Sabrina can't believe that Yennefer likes a witcher.
At the magicians' meeting, she is seen chatting with Marti Södergren, directing her attention towards the witcher Geralt when he enters the party with Yennefer. She approaches and is introduced by Yen. She holds out her hand for Geralt to kiss. Sabrina makes advances to him in front of Yennefer, although Geralt rejected it. Sabrina clearly enjoys irritating Yennefer.

Cahir is a knight from the Nilfgaardian Empire in search of Princess Ciri.
Biography.
Invasion of Cintra.
Cahir leads the Nilfgaardian army in battle against Queen Calanthe, King Eist, and the Cintran army in a field just outside Cintra. However, the Cintran army is decimated by the invaders as, unknown to Cintra, Nilfgaard's mages had wiped out all possible Skelligan reinforcements at sea by causing a massive storm. Cahir personally fires the arrow that pierces Eist's eye, instantly killing the king and forcing Queen Calanthe and her remaining soldiers to retreat.
Nilfgaardian forces then make their way to the city and begin to slaughter everyone within the city's walls while Cahir goes looking for the princess, soon spotting her as she's escorted out of the castle on horseback. As Ciri and Sir Lazlo attempt to flee from Cahir, Lazlo is killed by one of Cahir's arrows, and the dead knight's body ends up dragging Ciri off the horse as the body falls to the ground.
Having caught up with Ciri, Cahir takes her prisoner and races off on horseback, hastily leaving the burning city behind. However, on seeing this sight, Ciri screams, releasing a powerful magical pulse that scares Cahir's horse, knocking them both to the ground. As Cahir tries to grab her again, Ciri releases several more screams, each time getting more and more powerful, preventing Cahir from getting her as she puts more distance between them. After one such scream, a nearby stone monolith collapses and causes the ground to split and create a chasm between the two, allowing Ciri to escape.
Searching for Princess Ciri.
Cahir and his men invade a Cintran refugee camp in the late hours of the night, slaughtering everyone in their path, in search of Ciri, who manages to escape unseen.
Conquering Cintra.
After conquering Cintra, Cahir and Fringilla search for Queen Calanthe's body. They find her on the ground, buried underneath the snow. One of Fringilla's comrades slices a piece out of Calanthe's arm and eats her flesh. Fringilla then guts him and is able to determine that Ciri is in Brokilon forest. One of his men suggests sending soldiers in to take Ciri, however, Cahir knows that armies are not the way into Brokilon forest.
Retrieving Ciri from Brokilon Forest.
Cahir seeks out the help of a doppler in order to retrieve Princess Ciri from Brokilon forest. Cahir takes him to Mousesack, who they've captured. Cahir orders the doppler to take on his appearance. Cahir releases Mousesack from his chains only for the doppler to tackle him to the ground and shape shift into him, before stabbing Mousesack with a knife. After killing him, Cahir demands that Ciri is brought to him alive.
Capturing Ciri.
Cahir captured Ciri in the woods as she fled from the Adonis. If it had been any other way to extract Ciri, he would've done it. All he'd ever wanted was to fulfill her destiny. The White Flame had brought them together. She was the key to everything. As Cahir was fetching something to eat, he was confronted by the Adonis, who had taken on his appearance and in doing so, discovered what Ciri truly was. A fight ensued and Cahir was stabbed in the process, allowing the Adonis to escape.
Cahir murdered everyone inside the tavern to insure they weren't the doppler. As Fringilla cleaned his wound, she remarked that a simple test of silver would've sufficed. Fringilla stated that they could pull more soldiers and keep searching for Ciri. Fringilla reminded Cahir that it was he who rose up against the Usurper and helped free their people from their chains. She witnessed the White Flame crawl on him and anoint him. Ciri may be the key, but Cahir was the commissioner. They will find Ciri and spread the White Flame's supremacy throughout all kingdoms.
Battle of Sodden Hill.
After discovering that the Brotherhood was fortifying the keep, Fringilla reported back to Cahir to alert him of their arrival. The field Marshall recommended that they fall back, but Fringilla desired to move forward with the plan. This was their chance to honor the White Flame. Cahir refused to lose Princess Cirilla and ordered Fringilla to tests the Brotherhood's defenses.
Fringilla and Cahir watched from the top of the hill as their men were taken out by the brotherhood. They were forced to move to the other front. Vilgefortz portalled to Cahir's destination, taking out half a dozen soldiers before getting to Cahir. During the fight, Vilgefortz was disarmed multiple times, each time using magic to return his sword, despite Yennefer's warnings to reserve his chaos. Vilgefortz is bested by Cahir and with his chaos depleted, Cahir kicked him off the hill. Vilgefortz rolled down the hill and hit his head on a tree stump.
Much later in the battle, Cahir watched from a distance as his army went up in flames; burned to ashes by Yennefer of Vengerberg.
Prisoner of War.
Cahir was taken and held prisoner at Aretuza by the Brotherhood, where he was tortured by Tissaia who sought not only answers but to punish him for Yennefer's death, though he remained strong, insistent that the White Flame would cleanse them all. Tissaia demanded that he reveal what Nilfgaard wanted, but when he refused to speak, she tortured him until the point of screaming.
While sitting in his cell, Cahir had a brief interaction with Yennefer, who was not dead, only taken prisoner, later to escape. She told him that he wouldn't meet his end by their hands, as death must serve a purpose, and his would serve none. Fringilla told Cahir about Yennefer, that how she envied her during their days as schoolmates.
The following evening, Yennefer and Cahir walked side by side to his execution. She explained that his death now served a purpose, it would be her absolution. She was to execute him as proof that she hadn't been turned by the enemy. However, when the time came to cut off Cahir's head, she instead cut his chains and helped him escape on horseback.
Fleeing Oxenfurt with Yennefer.
Cahir and Yennefer were on the run in Oxenfurt, where he learned from Yennefer that under Fringilla's leadership, Nilfgaard had forged an alliance with the elves. They were then forced to go into hiding when wanted posters for their arrest were released to the public. Cahir and Yennefer headed down into the sewers after being attacked by a guard, where they met Dermain and Ba'lian, who told them about the Sandpiper, who helped elves get passage to Xin'trea. However, on their journey to the Sandpiper, Dermain was taken by some kind of tentacled creature whilst Ba'lian fled. Yennefer was nearly captured as well, but Cahir managed to pull her to safety.
The duo made their way back to the surface, where he realized that Yennefer lost her powers that day on the battlefield in Sodden. He believed that maybe Yennefer had a bigger purpose. He and Fringilla served the White Flame because he served them first. Everyone answered to someone eventually. Cahir and Yennefer then spotted Ba'lian creeping into a tavern through the back entrance and joined him. The elves explained that they had to wait for the tavern to empty, then the piper would take them to the boat. As it turned out, the Sandpiper was Jaskier, who agreed to help them get to Cintra.
Jaskier distracted the guards so that the others could sneak aboard the ship. Once inside, he bid them farewell. However, as soon as Jaskier left, Yennefer heard him scream and went to investigate, only to find his lute laying on the ground. Instead of leaving for Cintra with Cahir, she went to find Jaskier, parting ways with Cahir.
Returning to Cintra.
Cahir awakened from a nightmare on the boat just as they were arriving in Cintra. Cahir tried to skip the line into Xin'trea, but Gage and Filavandrel blocked his entrance and informed him that he must first declare himself, but then Fringilla joined them and welcomed Cahir home.
Cahir understood that Fringilla was forced to make a difficult decision during such times, by aligning with the elves, but he knew her well enough to understand that she didn't forsake the mission given to them by the White Flame. And now it was time they returned to the reason they took Cintra in the first place, which was Ciri, who was last seen in Sodden.
After catching up with General Hake, who was glad to have Cahir back, Cahir noticed Filavandrel coaching Dara and proposed a proper demonstration between him and the untrained elf. Cahir grabbed a sword and charged at Dara, knocking him on the ground, referring to him as a fairy. Filavandrel held his blade to Cahir's throat in retaliation but released him after getting word from Gage that Francesca had gone into labor.
Cahir and Fringilla watched as the elves celebrated the birth of a pure blood. He could only recall one other time of such celebration: after the Usurper was overthrown and the people rose up. It took Fringilla a while to feel free, and now it was she who gave the elves hope. Although, Cahir wondered what this would do to their alliance. What would happen when the elves decided they could repopulate on their own, without Nilfgaard's help. He then revealed that the White Flame wrote him and would be in Cintra any day now.
Submitting to Fringilla.
Hake reported to Cahir his concern that Redania had likely implanted a spy, as it's what he would've done. While Cahir agreed with Fringilla that they needed to rebuild their army, he acknowledged Hake's concerns and intended to build upon their army wisely. When he revealed that half the elves didn't even show up for training, Fringilla assured them that she would talk to them. With the White Flame's arrival tomorrow, Cahir would not have him met with chaos and insubordination. If the elves refused to serve, Cahir would like to deal with them, as the generals and White Flame would respect a strong hand.
Hake had his doubts about Fringilla all along and questioned why the White Flame would allow a mage to give his orders. Cahir remarked that they were supposed to be on the same side and searching for Ciri. Hake replied they'd find her as soon as they unloaded Fringilla's dead weight. Suddenly, they became paralyzed after Fringilla poisons them with nightshade, which possesses paralytic qualities. Fringilla proceeded to kill every general seated at the table until only Cahir remained, but she left him alive to tell Emhyr that the generals were killed for their treachery.
Imprisoned by the White Flame.
Cahir learned from Fringilla that Francesca and Filavandrel were gone with some of the elves to avenge their child, who had been killed during the night, likely by Redania. Cahir questioned why Francesca was so important to her, realizing that she was the key to Fringilla's plan to show the White Flame that she was a valuable leader. Cahir suggested that they lie to the White Flame and inform him that they killed the elven child and blamed Redania in order to gain the elves' allegiance.
Cahir and Fringilla greeted Emperor Emhyr as he arrived in Cintra. They explained that while the elves may not wear their colors, they were doing Nilfgaard's bidding. He questioned how they convinced the elves to fight. They did so by killing Francesca's baby and blaming Redania. However, Emhyr knew that they were lying as it was he who ordered the death of the elven baby, as it was the best path to helping him find his daughter, Ciri. He then ordered for Cahir and Fringilla to be taken away.

Istredd was a sorcerer who was romantically involved with Yennefer during their time at Aretuza.
Biography.
Meeting Yennefer.
While tending to his studies in the Aretuzan ruins, Istredd met Yennefer after she used a portal for the first time. He informed her that she had been marked, so he created an untraceable portal to send Yennefer back home and assured her that he's to be trusted. Istredd reconvened with Yennefer after she was brought into Aretuza by Tissaia de Vries.
Several weeks passed since Yennefer's arrival in Aretuza. After she failed to complete a trial and was scolded by Tissaia, Yennefer retreated to Istredd and detailed her shortcomings. He advised her to keep trying. He didn't give up and was later able to read minds. He even helped Yennefer read his mind, revealing glimpses of cicadas, warm bread and other things that she might have enjoyed.
After losing control of her emotions, Yennefer found Istredd and informed him of her fear of being sent home. Istredd insisted that they would find a way to be together. He couldn't show Yennefer what he knew because he had to ensure that the knowledge never reached the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. What that would require was magic other than that of which they were taught. It is too potent and can open doors that can't be closed. Istredd instead showed her the skulls of the elves who built Aretuza. They were the original sorcerers of the continent. When humans and monsters arrived after the Conjunction of the Spheres, elven mages showed the first humans how to turn chaos into magic. And then the humans slaughtered them so they could pretend the power had always belonged to them, rewriting history. Istredd wished to honor them rather than continue telling the false history. He gave Yennefer a Feainnewedd that only grew where Elder Blood has spilled. Using this plant, Yennefer summoned a portal with no difficulty and revealed that her real father was a half-elf. He was killed during the Great Cleansing. His blood was why she was cursed with a twisted spine and why no one could ever love her. Istredd then kissed her, as if to prove Yennefer wrong about no one loving her.
After gaining Yennefer's trust, Istredd revealed her elven heritage to Stregobor.
Betrayal of trust.
It's initiation day, and Istredd and Yennefer are having sex in front of an illusory audience. Afterward, they share their mutual fears of being separated with Istredd exploring ruins and Yennefer working as a mage to King Virfuril. Yennefer recalls the frightened girl she once was, completely unaware of her power. She wants to go back home to Aedirn and never be that girl again.
Istredd goes searching for Yennefer after she fails to attend the initiation. He finds her in the ruins forging her father's name on a deed to declare her as his natural born daughter. Istredd apologizes for telling Stregobor her secret. She wants him to go back to the Chapter and tell them that he lied, but it's too late as Yennefer missed initiation and the enchantments are done. Istredd offers to right his wrong. The Brotherhood offered him a seat on the research chapter. He wishes to bring Yennefer along with him. However, she wants more than a life holding dustpans while he brushes bones. Yennefer storms off, but not before Istredd exclaims that she's just angry because she lost her chance to be beautiful. Not only beauty, Yennefer wants power, she admits.
Much to Istredd's displeasure, Yennefer arrives at the Aretuzan ball completely transformed. Appearing almost entirely like a new person.
Excavation in Nazair.
While working in Nazair, on a Nilfgaard ran excavation site, Istredd reunited with Yennefer after years apart. They started digging because the tunes described a "magnalith" in Nazair, but no one could find it until Istredd arrived and Nilfgaard tore through the lands. They allowed his research. Every glyph had a clue to something across the continent from a time before the Conjunction. Yennefer took a sip of the ale, which she described as having a terrible taste. However, Istredd claimed that the people of Nazair were starving before Nilfgaard's arrival. Yennefer surmised that Istredd "bought in."
She questioned how much longer Istredd intended to stay in Nazair as she missed him. Yennefer asked if it wasn't too late to do what they talked about all those years ago in the cave of Aretuza. Living a life together. Istredd could excavate as she worked as a mage. He recalled how Yennefer always hated monoliths. Admittedly this was true, but Yennefer had spent decades being the object of desire, having anyone she wanted. But they all loved the power that came with her position at court. Not her actual power. And no one had ever seen that but Istredd. Yennefer then kissed him. However, he pulled away. He spent years waiting for the moment that Yennefer realized that they were meant for each other. Coming up with excuses to study at Aedirn. Anything to get closer to her, but every request he made was denied by her. It was Stregobor who snapped him out of it. He reminded Istredd of the beauty of their work. Yennefer went after the thing she loved, so she chose power. At least she kept her eyes, he remarked, before departing.
Called before the Brotherhood.
Following the Battle of Sodden Hill, Istredd was brought before the Brotherhood and asked if he absorbed any insight into their followers while at the Nilfgaard dig sight. But he claimed to have absorbed nothing, despite later informing Yennefer that he lied as she was attempting to flee Aretuza due to the Brotherhood calling her loyalty into question and commanding her to execute Cahir. As for Istredd, he planned to leave for Cintra the following day to help the elves who were migrating and also advised Yennefer against sneaking out, as Stregobor had spies stationed on the tower.
Investigating Cintra's monolith.
While searching for a new land route to Cintra, Istredd received an unexpected visit from Geralt, who was in need of his help after coming across a new subspecies of monster, which he suspected were emerging from a stellacite tower just outside Cintra and that the monster were nesting in the subterranean structure for years. They crawled down into the subterranean but didn't uncover a nest or any evidence of life. Historians had always theorized that monoliths were scars from the Conjunction of the Spheres, but monster didn't exist on their plane before the Conjunction. All species were on different planes until the spheres merged into one. A Conjunction like that would've required two things: a massive surge of energy and conduits to channel it, leading Istredd to suspect that the monoliths were actually conduits, meaning their monoliths were calling to the original spheres, opening a gateway between the spheres and the Continent.
Istredd demanded that Geralt tell him exactly how he knew the monsters and monoliths were linked, but Geralt was reluctant to inform him of anything, as he didn't trust Istredd, who in a moment of transparency, revealed that he actually came to Cintra in search of Yennefer. At that Geralt discovered from him that Yennefer was alive, at the same time Istredd realized that Geralt loves her like he loves her. Suddenly, the ground began to shake and they heard Ciri's scream for help. However, they were forced to take cover as shards of stellacite began flying at them. This resulted in a portal opening and a chernobog of some kind emerging and flying away.
After portalling Geralt home, Istredd returned to his studies, questioning if the monolith is what Queen Calanthe was protecting all this time. He then began searching through the royal Cintran family tree. Hidden within the pages was an aberration that simply didn't make sense. There was no record of Ciri's lineage beyond the mention of Fiona, Calanthe's great-grandmother.
Seeking information.
Istredd sought out Ellis Codringher and Fenn for information in regard to what a witcher, a monolith, and a mysterious girl had to do with Nilfgaard. From them, he learned that the girl was Cirilla of Cintra, who was thought to be dead.
Istredd revealed to Codringher and Fenn that there was a gene called Leishardrathardlara that kept showing up in Cintran genealogy records, but he'd never heard of it, and it looked like mostly women had it. Codringher grabbed a scroll and Fenn read "And when the humans proved hostile, bringing death and destruction, multiplying and infesting their lands, the elves created a weapon to destroy them." The scroll actually said that the elves had created a warrior, Lara Dorren. Also, "And when the babe was born, a field of feainnewedd sprung up. And Lara Dorren drew her last breath, crying, 'Know this. My curse will hound your descendants unto the tenth generation. Until the columns of time and space tremble and open for my people. Then my vengeance will be born again." This suggested that Calanthe hid her elven bloodline because she knew what lurked in it. A generational weapon, Istredd remarked.
Having discovered the secret of Ciri's lineage, Istredd tracked down the elves to inform them that Princess Cirilla was alive and that she was Hen Ikeir, meaning Elder blood.
