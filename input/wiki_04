"Dzieciństwo" (English: "Childhood") is the first episode of "The Hexer" TV series. It is not based directly on any of Andrzej Sapkowski's short stories.
Plot Synopsis.
The episode starts with a scene set in the future, showing a man (Geralt of Rivia) slaying a monster in swamp land. Returning to present times, an old witcher has come to reclaim a debt with some humans- in exchange for being saved from a werewolf attack by Thornwald, Korin must give up his newborn son to the man so that he can become a Witcher. Korin and Visenna resist but the child surrenders himself and is taken away. As they leave, Visenna casts magic of sorts and curses Geralt to never be able to become a true witcher.
Geralt and the old witcher travel to Kaer Morhen, with Geralt attempting to run away so many times that the old witcher ties him to his belt via a rope. Despite this, he is kind to the boy, stopping to rest and feeding him. Upon arrival, the boy is taken to rest within the caves while the council meet together and discuss the recent shortcomings of their witchers and a lack in numbers- renegades that require to be killed, the fact that 4 out of 5 children don't even survive the metamorphism and that though they were trained to fight monsters, more and more are dying in their profession leading to thoughts that they are not good enough anymore and lack adequate training. Many of the council oppose the comments made however, and are very opposed to the idea that the old way, the code of the witcher, is outdated and inadequate. They do agree on the fact that they are running out of witchers however, and this divide in the council starts different paths with how they decide to deal with such a situation.
Geralt is now seen back in the caves, chained to a table and undergoing the metamorphism to become a witcher. The elders comment that his body is resisting the change, and they are unsure if he will make it. Vesemir makes the call to pause the process and let the boy rest despite the wishes of Jarrow, conducting the metamorphism. Geralt later wakes up in the morning, struggling in his chains; he keeps seeing visions of his mother telling him to be strong and resist the changes. Vesemir and Jarrow discuss the issues that arose in the meeting the day before; the witchers are becoming outdated and refuse to adapt. Jarrow blames this on the fact that they cannot understand the situation as they do for they are deprived of higher feelings and deeper thought associations- they were merely created to kill. Vesemir admits that Gwidon was right in the meeting and that the fault with the witchers betraying or dying lies not in the training, but in the overall change process itself. If they are to change future witchers, they need to make the changes there. He goes on to comment that witchers can't be mindless killers alone, they need to be knights of honour, law and good deeds if the situation is to be rectified. Vesemir now asks for Jarrow's support, to expand the capabilities of witchers by granting them the ability to coexist with humans- to not be completely witcher but not human either. Jarrow agrees and the two keep the secret to themselves that Geralt will be the first of these new witchers.
Meanwhile, a witcher patrol is attacked by a renegade group of elves whilst travelling back to the fort with food and supplies. All the supplies were raided, and only one witcher survives, ingesting herbs to keep himself alive. Likewise, the metamorphism of Geralt continues with another intense session of poisons being applied. Things look bad and it seems like he is not going to make it; suddenly, he begins calling out to his mother to come and protect him. Shocked, the Chaplains and witchers present comment that he shouldn't be doing that at the stage he is up to, that he should have forgotten it all. Jarrow quickly replies that it is just "tissue memory", or ramblings of a dying person, and thinks the child won't make it. Having walked in the middle of the situation, Vesemir angrily orders everyone but Jarrow to leave. He comforts Geralt, who now has white hair and golden slit eyes, telling him to sleep but fight the call of death.
Gwidon is unconvinced that Geralt is going through the change properly and demands a test of dreams- Vesemir agrees and calls for a druid to come and perform the test the following day. He then moves on to question Gwidon's training tactics, pointing out that 2 students died recently under his care during a time when they're already low on numbers. Gwidon resists but Vesemir eventually forces him to change his tactics and be more gentle with the students by pointing out that his tactics go against the witcher code, much to Gwidon's dislike. Vesemir highlights that while times are hard, having to support themselves now rather than being supported by rulers, that they cannot take it out on each other. The following day during training, the lone witcher from the raid appears, explaining what happened. The other withcers question why he didn't stay to fight, and he presents them all with the heads of several elves before collapsing.
The druids begin their dream test on Geralt now. While in the induced trance, Geralt technically fails the test as he has visions of a face appear before him, but he cannot give details as to who's face it is. When the druid is questioned later by Vesemir as to whether the child's transformation was successful, the druid tells him and Gwidon that Geralt is "not a human, not a mutant or a monster"; he is both witcher and human. He has recollection of past memories but isn't able to associate them to anything in specific (seeing the face of his mother) and will be attracted to women despite not being fertile (it is unclear at this stage whether the associated asexuality of witchers is because they have never known what women are or if the asexuality is a repercussion of the mutagens). Gwidon again is unconvinced of Geralt's mutation and demands the trial of the mountain, where the child is to be left in the wilderness to fend for himself for 30 days to truly test that he is no longer human. Vesemir resists on the account that no one has survived the barbaric trial, but is compelled to do so anyway to prove Geralt is not human considering the druid's comments.
Gwidon is about to lead a party out to fetch food and supplies for the fort. Vesemir approaches him and gives him the last of the elder's money, forbidding him to take revenge on the elves and to instead buy what they need, for the elves also have nothing to eat. When questioned, Vesemir reveals that an elven messenger stopped by to tell them that the attacks were just mad elves part of the hunger hoard- Vesemir asks Gwidon to take pity on their plight and help maintain the peace, which makes Gwidon furious as he replies that witchers were made to fight, not maintain peace but bends to Vesemir's will anyway. Vesemir later calls upon the old witcher again to take Geralt up into the mountains. While there's nothing they can do about the situation, he points out to the old witcher that they can help Geralt by giving him useful advice on how to survive, and to leave him close to the road to Tes.
The old witcher and Geralt travel out into the wilderness, and the old witcher shares much advice with him in regards to survival in the wild. A pyramid of 4 skulls sit on a large boulder watch them- the skulls of those who did not survive the trial in the past. The old witcher tells him to forget about that and focus on the present, saying he will be back in 30 days and then leaving, giving Geralt a small array of weapons to defend himself with. The following morning, Geralt buries the skulls before trying his hand at hunting and fishing for food. By the river, he encounters a lone she-wolf who bares down on Geralt initially while protecting her den with cubs in it. Slowly, Geralt wins her favour by tending to her wounds and giving them some of his food, naming the wolf Fangtooth. Out exploring one day, Geralt gets too close to the road to Tes; a travelling caravan of people pass by and get angry with him, and begin to throw rocks at the boy. One woman alone asks them to stop doing so, but they continue until Geralt runs away. The travelling party is then attacked by Gwidon's party, with all the adults being killed and the caravan with children and supplies taken away to Kaer Morhen. Geralt witnesses this and after the attack is finished, goes down to the wreckage scene of what Gwidon's party left behind; a small cart and all the dead adults. He loots some items from them, and in particular feels sorry for the woman who previously defended him- he takes her necklace and wears it to remember her.
The caravan and Gwidon's party arrive back at Kaer Morhen, and he and his men tell the elders that what they found was merely what they rescued from an elven attack. The children were also taught the same lie as they comment the same thing- Vesemir is unconvinced but without any proof, let's them be. The following day, Geralt finds Adela and begins to nurse her back to health- she was left in the wild to die following the siege on the caravan the previous day. Meanwhile, Vesemir is trying to resolve the situation for a peaceful result- he sends a priest with a letter to the elves to tell them what happened in hopes of getting to the bottom of the situation, while the new children are kept in the caves under the false pretence of being diseased. Back in the forest, Geralt continues looking after the new girl, and she questions the necklace he is wearing as it belonged to her mother. Geralt inevitably has to explained what happened, and comforts the girl by telling her to be brave.
Some time passes and the old witcher returns for Geralt. He has a run in with Fangtooth but Geralt intervenes before anything happens. They get talking around a campfire and Geralt tells the witcher what he saw regarding the attack on the road; the old witcher then takes both Geralt and Adela back to Kaer Morhen, with Geralt having to say goodbye to Fangtooth. Geralt comments to the old witcher that Fangtooth didn't want him to go because he was a wolf. The old witcher agrees, and says he is a white wolf. Upon arriving back, they go straight to Vesemir with the evidence of the attack and devastated as he is to find another renegade witcher, Vesemir calls for a final meeting to put an end to this. Holding a formal trial, Gwidon is officially accused of his crimes and is forced to relinquish his witcher artifacts, and is banished from the fort. Before leaving, he swears revenge on Geralt for bringing the evidence to them, and Geralt in return swears to kill him and tells Vesemir that he wishes to be a full witcher.

"Dolina Kwiatów" (English: "The Valley of Flowers") is the seventh episode of "The Hexer" TV series. It is based on the short stories "Eternal Flame" and "The Edge of the World" by Andrzej Sapkowski.
Summary.
The first part of the episode takes place in Novigrad, where Geralt and Dandelion encounter a doppler impersonating Dainty Biberveldt, a halfling merchant. Then they leave Novigrad and head for Dol Blathanna.
After finding no real work for a witcher in Upper Posada, Geralt rides down a road with Dandelion. Nettly, a local farmer, catches up with them, saying he has a job; they go to Lower Posada to discuss.
The village elder, Dhun, tells of a 'devil' whose mischief has turned from frolicking to foul, but under no circumstances should the creature be killed. Despite Dandelion's claims that there are no devils, Geralt agrees to take a look and see what he can do.
Out in the fields, near the hemp and the hops, Geralt and Dandelion the 'devil'. Dandelion and the bleating 'devil' exchange a couple of words which only serve to provoke the latter; he takes aim and starts throwing iron balls at the witcher and his friend, and they flee.
Back in the village, Geralt confronts Dhun and Nettly, and meets the community's old wise woman and Lille. After some discussion, an ancient book is brought forth, and the old woman 'reads' appointed entries from it. This way, the witcher and the bard learn that the devil is, in fact, a sylvan, and the villagers tried to outsmart him as per the book's suggestion. The old woman and Lille leave, taking the book with them; Geralt converses with the men some more.
Later, back in the fields, Geralt meets the sylvan anew; the negotiations end in a tussle among the hemp. The sylvan flees into the hops, followed by Geralt. But there's a twist in the story, and the witcher's knocked unconscious.
He stirs, tied up, to the sounds of people talking in the Old Language; he recognizes one of the voices as belonging to the 'devil', and learns his name is Torque. Next to the witcher, Dandelion's similarly bound.
Their captors, elves, notice their captives have awakened, and Toruviel approaches them, aggressive. She breaks Dandelion's lute, Geralt headbutts her, breaking her nose, and the elves draw blades. They're stopped by Filavandrel. The relief doesn't last long, though, for the bard and the witcher are tied to a pine tree with belts. Geralt tries to talk some sense into the elves' heads, but it's of no use. The elves aim their bows.
It's then that the Queen of the Fields enters. The elves halt, lower their weapons, and bow. Filavandrel pleads with her, but she doesn't say a word. Meanwhile, Torque's cutting Geralt and Dandelion free.
After a moment, the elves get up, silent, saddle their horses and start to leave. Filavandrel bids Geralt farewell, Toruviel gives Dandelion a new lute, and they part ways.

"The Bounds of Reason" (Polish: "Granica możliwości") is a short story written by Andrzej Sapkowski and is the first story in "Sword of Destiny".
Summary.
This is the story of a hunt for a legendary golden dragon Villentretenmerth. The story also expands on the relationship between the sorceress Yennefer and Geralt the witcher, which began in earlier .
Geralt has been hired to kill a basilisk lurking in a ruined crypt near Barefield. As the story opens, it has been quite some time since the witcher disappeared into the crypt, and the peasants are beginning to mutter amongst themselves that he must be dead by now, otherwise he would have reappeared. Acting on this assumption, they decide to take the witcher's belongings. Just when they are about to reach for the pack, a knight – Borch Three Jackdaws – appears accompanied by two Zerrikanian warriors: Téa and Véa. He makes it clear that this would not be a very good idea at all and the presence of his "entourage" gives the mob pause to consider this.
Fortunately Geralt emerges from the crypt, filthy and dragging the head of the now defunct basilisk. Faced with a very much alive witcher and the knight's party, the peasants back down and flee leaving the alderman to pay Geralt the agreed 200 lintars. The witcher and Borch exchange greetings and thanks, and then the knight invites Geralt to join him at a local inn, "The Pensive Dragon". Geralt is pleased to see that the fact that he is a witcher is no deterrent to potential friendship and agrees to the invitation of an amicable evening.
Once at the inn, the group settles in for an evening of food, wine and conversation. Over the course of their discussion, Borch inquires whether or not Geralt would kill dragons. Geralt explains that no, he would not. It is not dragons who terrorize humans, but the reverse. The knight is pleased to hear this and then excuses himself briefly. While he is away, Geralt takes the opportunity to ask Vea why she travels with Borch. To his surprise, she responds "Because he is the most beautiful".
The next day, Geralt, Borch and the Zerrikanians set out towards Hengfors. Not long into their journey, they are stopped at the border (the only bridge across the Braa for miles) and told that they may not continue without a letter of safe-conduct. As it happens, Dandelion is also among the other travelers who have also recently been barred passage. He tells Geralt that king Niedamir is in the area hunting a dragon who recently appeared.
After this dragon allegedly terrorized a nearby village, the villagers decided to trap and kill it. The local shoemaker, Sheepbagger, planted a dead sheep stuffed with hellebore, belladonna, hemlock, sulfur, pitch and tacks in the middle of their flock as bait for the beast. And just to be sure, the local apothecary added two measures of carbuncle salve to the mixture which was then blessed by the local priest of Kreve.
While there were a few initial concerns that the saurian would decimate the flock before eating the "offering", the locals were happily surprised to see the beast make a bee-line for the bait. The lizard devoured it in one gulp and then tried to fly off, but fell to the ground almost immediately. At this point the local gravedigger and the village idiot decided to go and check to see if the dragon was indeed dead. Not the best move as it was not dead, but severely weakened. So much so, that it was only able to suck their blood before trying once again to fly off. After a few more attempts, it was able to limp away clearly suffering, but the locals want it dead and feel that its treasure belongs to them, after all, dragons always have a hoard of treasure.
The witcher finds the whole story rather preposterous as dragons have not been seen in the area for years, but the bard assures him that while his tales might suffer from a bit of (necessary!) embellishment, they were essentially true. Borch seems interested in the fact that the dragon was not killed but more concerned that they have nothing to drink and sends his "girls" off to get some.
King Niedamir has his own reasons for tracking the beast, and strangely enough the treasure is not his primary goal. The title of "dragon killer" is what he is after. This would help him secure the hand of the princess of Malleore which would satisfy his political objectives and fit nicely into a trumped-up local legend that she may only marry a "dragon-killer". The king does not want this plan exposed so he sends out a call for a dragon hunting crew. This call is answered by: Eyck of Denesle, a knight, Boholt and his men, the Crinfrid Reavers, Yarpen Zigrin, a dwarf and his crew, the shoemaker Sheepbagger and a sorceress.
After a time, Tea and Vea return with beer and a mage in tow: Dorregaray, who is also interested in taking part in the expedition, but not a hunt. The mage is also without a letter of safe conduct and Dandelion wastes no time in pointing out that one of his colleagues apparently already does, the sorceress with the king's party. At this point, Dorregarary guesses quite correctly that said sorceress is none other than Yennefer. Hearing that Yennefer is with the king's party, Geralt decides to join the hunt. He goes to take his leave of Borch, but the latter informs that there is nothing in particular which forces him to go to Hengfors right away and that he would be happy to continue with the witcher.
The witcher has had enough of sitting around and attempts to bribe the border guard with 200 gold, but his offer is refused. Borch raises the offer to 500 and tells Geralt to put his purse away. This is enough to sway the guard who then starts fretting about what he will tell his superiors. Dorregaray seals the deal by telling him to simply say he was scared senseless by a magical display and promptly sets a large nearby pine ablaze with a wave of his hand. The new larger party then crosses the river and continues on its way to join the dragon hunting expedition.
Before too long, the witcher and his party meet up with Yarpen Zigrin.
The various camps have rather different plans for the dragon. Boholt and Yarpen formed an alliance with Yennefer, Eyck wanted to kill a dragon in a fair fight, Dandelion wanted to witness the events firsthand and write an epic ballad. Geralt meets with Yennefer but the sorceress is not interested in talking to him. She cannot forgive him for simply disappearing for 4 years. She states that she is here solely to collect dragon tissue with which she hopes to create an elixir to treat her infertility. She desperately wants to be a mother but can't. Niedamir is bored by the bickering and decides to appoint a marshal, Gyllenstiern.
The journey continues. Yennefer and Geralt gritting their teeth, Dorregaray teasing Geralt and calling him a killer of endangered species, and Eyck shouting to cleanse the ranks of non-humans. Meanwhile, the team, having reached a narrow section in an already rocky path, is caught in a rockslide. Most of them manage to get across the next bridge before it collapses, but part of the team is left behind. Geralt and Yennefer fall into the canyon but at the last moment the witcher manages to plant his dagger into the timbers of the bridge and grabs it with both hands. Yen is left clinging to the scabbards on his back. While they dangle perilously, they have ample opportunity to overhear what is being said about them above - not the least of which is a plan to wait until the enchantress becomes exhausted and falls to her death. Eventually, the honorable Eyck decides to throw them a magic elven rope.
Borch and the Zerrikankians disappear. The situation is tense for the team. Eyck considers the avalanche a divine punishment for allowing the presence of heathens, such as the witcher and the dwarves on the team. Geralt quarrels with him briefly but decides not to leave. Suddenly shouts are heard announcing that a dragon is very close at hand, but not the one for which the hunt was organized. The group face an enormous golden dragon, a living legend, in which Geralt had never previously believed. Despite impassioned pleas from Dandelion and Dorregaray, the group decides to kill the beast.
The troubadour sees the dragon as a living legend, and such legends should be left alone. Sheepbagger proposes to use the same ploy he used with the other dragon, namely a poisoned sheep carcass as bait, but the dwarf, Yarpen scoffs at this plan. The dragon himself decides to address the team using telepathy. He gives them two options: leave or face him in a fair duel using conventional weapons (which is to say, without fireballs, flying or other magic).
Eyck is the first to challenge him, as an honorable duel was exactly what he had hoped to engage in. His entrance is rather comically heralded by Yarpen. Sitting very erect in his saddle, he moves to charge the dragon, but the beast is very agile and effortlessly sends the hapless knight (along with his horse!) flying through the air with a flick of one claw. Next please!
Yennefer decides to convince Geralt to kill the dragon, saying that everything between them would be resolved and that they would go back to their previous relationship. The witcher, however, remembers very clearly her earlier comments which had specifically excluded this possibility. He declares that killing the dragon would go beyond "the limits of possibility" provided for in his code of honor.
Meanwhile, Gyllenstiern is getting antsy having seen Eyck go down so quickly and looks to Boholt and his men. Boholt is quite unimpressed with what has happened so far and accuses Gyllenstiern of using Eyck to fight his battles for him and also of intending to run off with the spoils. The leader of the Reavers renounces the "deal" to help the king saying they will kill the dragon themselves and take the treasure saying that the Caingorn contingent of the party has failed in its quest. Sheepbagger begs the king to let the village militia, who are still on their way via a different route, kill the dragon but Gyllenstiern feels the situation is getting out of hand. He asks the king what the group should do.
The king rather sarcastically thanks his marshal for finally asking his opinion and proceeds to state it. He says that while it is true that he has wasted time chasing the dragon, he has also learned much. He decides to gather his men, including the broken Eyck and leave, suggesting the rest of the group do the same. When Gyllenstiern protests, he states that killing the dragon is not necessary to win the hand of the princess, he has at least twice as many troops as the princess' father so winning her hand is militarily assured anyway. Not that he needs her hand, he only needs her womb, to bear him an heir after which time the princess will be conveniently poisoned, even using Sheepbagger's recipe! The king and his men then leave.
Boholt, Yarpen and Yennefer are all still intent on killing a dragon, but Dorregaray decides to personally put an end to the dragon hunt. Yennefer, however, has other plans and is a bit faster than Dorregaray expects. The mage is soon overwhelmed by the Reavers and the dwarves. Geralt and Dandelion then join the frey, trying to help him but just as the witcher is gaining the upper hand in the fight, Yennefer paralyses him and he falls numbly to the ground, helpless. The sorceress then orders that the three men be tied to the nearby wagons to keep them out of the way.
Yennefer then unexpectedly turns on the Reavers and the dwarves, telling them that they had better high-tail it out of there as well and threatens to geld them all with a spell if they don't comply. The sorceress is not quite as attentive as she should be and Yarpen manages to knock her momentarily senseless with a metal ball to the forehead. While Yennefer is disoriented, the Reavers pounce on her and bind her hands (including, especially her fingers!) with rope and then gag her to make sure she can't use magic against them.
Boholt then takes the opportunity to rip open her blouse and fondle her breasts as she tries in vain to protest. She then ends up also lashed to a wagon wheel, next to the witcher and in full view of the bard. Dandelion, true to his nature seems more concerned at that point with staring at the sorceress' breasts which have been conveniently left exposed.
This leaves Boholt, his men and the dwarves to face off against the dragon. As they stand around discussing and preparing for their next move, the dragon decides to come to them, stating that they were simply taking too long. The Reavers start out confidently enough but they are no more successful than Eyck was. The dragon is simply far better at this than any of them. Yarpen and his entire crew are knocked over with one sweep of Villentretenmerth's tail. Picking themselves up, they high-tail it for the cliffs running rather faster than one might imagine dwarf legs could.
Finally it becomes clear just what the dragon had been so fervently protecting. Not some hoard of treasure as expected, but a baby dragon. The tiny newly hatched dragon immediately makes its way over to Yennefer, nuzzling up to her, much to the envy of Dandelion. It now becomes clear that the dragon Sheepbagger had poisoned back in the village must have been the mother.
Suddenly, the rumbling of wagons alerts everyone to the fact that the local militia, lead by Sheepbagger has finally arrived and what seems like the entire village sets upon the dragon. The beast is simply outnumbered by the villagers who eventually manage to wrap him up in nets. At this point, Yennefer is finally able to speak and demands that the witcher burn the ropes around her ankles using his Igni sign. Geralt initially refuses saying that he can't see what he is doing and will burn her as well. She insists, saying that she'll endure the pain, and that this is their only hope, so he relents.
Once free (if not uninjured!) Yennefer uses her foot to cast a spell at the villagers. Her first effort only manages to change one wagon to a buttery shade of yellow which goes entirely unnoticed by the charging horde. Her next spells are more effective and she manages to turn an entire garrison into toads, square the wheels on another wagon and then, just for spite, change random other villagers into various and sundry beasts.
Meanwhile, the Zerrikanians reappear and start making quick work of the remaining locals, freeing the dragon who promptly takes off after Sheepbagger. The cobbler meets a rather grisly end which is witnessed by all present, but their attention soon turns back to their own predicament as Vea now prepares to kill Yennefer. Luckily for the sorceress, Villentretenmerth intervenes and declares that they will not be killing Lady Yennefer, in fact, they are grateful for her help and orders Vea to untie the prisoners. He then calls down the dwarves who are still clinging to the nearby cliff, telling them to go tend to the Reavers who do need help. He assures everyone that the killing spree is over.
The golden dragon then returns to human form, that of the knight called Borch Three Jackdaws. It seems that Borch is actually a dragon who simply takes human form because he can and because, not surprisingly, he attracts too much attention otherwise. Geralt asks him why he chose human form. Borch says that while it is true that humans normally inspire only revulsion in dragons, personally, he likes them.
Borch thanks Geralt and Yennefer for their help and tells them that anyone can see that the witcher and the sorceress were meant for each other, but sadly, nothing will come of their union. Additionally, and to Yennefer's obvious personal disappointment - he cannot cure her infertility. Even the magic of golden dragons has its limits. In less than the blink of an eye, Borch turns back into a dragon and promises his eternal friendship to Geralt, then heads off into the sunset with his new ward and his Zerrikanian companions. Watching him recede, the witcher finally understands Vea's words: Borch truly is the most beautiful.

A Shard of Ice

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"A Shard of Ice" (Polish: "Okruch lodu") is a short story written by Andrzej Sapkowski and is the second story in "Sword of Destiny". In the story we learn more about Geralt's history with the sorceress Yennefer.
Summary.
The story opens with Geralt in a fetid sewer in Aedd Gynvael, fighting a zeugl. After dispatching the beast, the witcher heads back to the inn where he and Yennefer have been staying. She greets him with "You stink!" and demands that he bathe immediately, in cold water. Once the witcher is sufficiently cleaned up, the sorceress magically dumps the water from the bath out the window, outraging a passerby. The two get to talking about the fact that Istredd has moved to town and that Yennefer has been not only working with him, but also sleeping with him. Geralt is quite obviously jealous of this.
That said, the witcher still has business to conclude and leaves to find Herbolth, the alderman who hired him to kill the zeugl, and claim his reward. However, before he can approach the alderman, he is stopped by Ivo Mirce "aka" "Cicada", a mercenary who happens to be working as a bodyguard for the alderman. Mirce eyes the witcher's sword enviously as he "confiscates" the weapon for reasons of security. The usual formalities ensue with Herbolth cheating the witcher out of the previously agreed sum.
After that business is concluded, Geralt heads over to Istredd's home. The mage explains to the witcher that he loves Yennefer and wants to marry her. Geralt tries to convince him that this is unwise because he and Yennefer are meant for each other. The mage accuses him of being delusional and points out that witchers are unable of human emotions, calling the witcher merely a toy for the sorceress. Geralt is incensed and suggests that it is Istredd who is being used. It's clear that the two cannot settle things by talking it through so they decide that they should settle things with a duel although both men agree that the idea of them dueling for Yennefer is absurd.
Back at the inn, Yennefer and Geralt argue some more about their relationship and about Yennefer and Istredd's relationship, but they resolve nothing.
Herbolth gets wind of this plan and tracks Geralt to the inn where the witcher is now sulking and drinking. The alderman throws down a purse with the originally agreed sum for the zeugl, and tells the witcher to take the money and get out of town, now. He explains that the city cannot afford to find another mage and that Istredd is far more useful to them than a witcher. He also explains that he can't simply throw the witcher in a dungeon as Istredd would never agree to such a breach of honour. Geralt suggests that the alderman pray for Istredd then and refuses to change his plans and leave. The alderman is exasperated and tells the witcher that they can go ahead and kill each other then, for all he cares.
After leaving the inn, Geralt is set upon by bandits, one of whom he recognizes from a dark corner of the inn earlier. The would-be thieves soon discover that they have chosen the wrong victim when one of them grabs the witcher's medallion. Geralt decides to spend the night in the stables rather than go back to the inn and Yennefer. During the night, he receives a message from the sorceress, delivered by a bird.
The next morning, Geralt sets off for his appointment with Istredd but is once again accosted by Cicada and his men. Mirce is intent on fighting the witcher, but Geralt punches Mirce in the mouth, knocking him into a mud puddle. He then decides to punch him again and finally finishes him off with a good swift kick. Ivo is left humiliated and bleeding in the mud.
Geralt continues on his original path to meet the mage for their duel. He soon learns that Istredd also received a message from Yennefer, by bird-messenger and that his message was the same. The mage readies his sword, his chosen weapon rather than using magic. Geralt sees that Istredd plans to intentionally lose the duel, and his life, due to Yennefer's rejection. In light of this Geralt refuses to fight, bids the mage good-bye and leaves.
Adaptations.
This short story was adapted as an episode of "The Hexer" TV series, also titled "Okruch lodu".

Eternal Flame

"Eternal Flame" (Polish: "Wieczny ogień") is a short story written by Andrzej Sapkowski and is the third story in "Sword of Destiny". The story is set in and around Novigrad and tells the story of how Geralt met Dudu.
Summary.
The story begins with Geralt hearing an angry loud scream and something slamming down to the street. He quickly makes his way to the source of the noises and witnesses a plump woman standing on a balcony, screaming and throwing flowerpots on a man on the street. They are arguing with each other and the man is jumping like a scalded cat in order to dodge a flower pot crashing down the ground. Geralt finds out that the woman's name is Vespula and the man is none other than Dandelion himself after listening to their argument. Dandelion sees Geralt as well and makes his way over to him, leaving the angry woman. They had a short conversation, and it turns out that Vespula was Dandelion's fiancé and he suggests that they should go to a tavern to calm his nerves after the fight.
On the way to the tavern, Geralt mentions that he and Yennefer are not a thing anymore and that he is in Novigrad to just do some simple tasks, at the same time is Dandelion working on his new ballad called "Winter".
At the mostly, folk empty tavern they met the merchant Dainty Biberveldt who is a halfling, a merchant and apparently a friend of Dandelion. Geralt and the poet sat down with the merchant who was cooking soup at the time. He had a wooden spoon in his left hand with onion rings hanging, swinging like a pendulum from the spoon and in his right an earthenware bowl. After a few minutes of conversation, suddenly the chamber door got smashed open and in came a second Dainty! From top to toe identical to the merchant.
The second Dainty leaped and screamed against the other Dainty starting a fight. Geralt acts quickly and instinctively joins the fight. The second Dainty goes down on all four and moves like a spider, runs away, colliding with a wench lass which causes her to make an ear-splitting scream. By the collision, Geralt managed to keep up with the second Dainty and knocked it to the ground. The creature deforms more and more and is begging for mercy. The innkeeper orders the screaming wench girl to get the guard but Dandelion is quick to stop her. The real Dainty explains that this is a private matter and he will pay for all the damage.
After some arguing with the innkeeper about calling the guard, they finally started communicating with the creature which they now knew was a doppler and named Tellico Lunngrevink Letorte or Dudu as his friends call him. Dainty described his look as a fermenting dough.
Fast into the conversation, Dainty asks where his horses are and claims that Dudu has robbed him and abandoned him in the forest as a copy of himself. This comes out to be true and Dainty wants to kill the thing but Geralt finds mercy for the doppler stating that he does not kill intelligent races. Instead, they make the doppler talk to see what he has done in the past days in Dainty Biberveldt's body. Interrupting the conversation, the innkeeper says that he should change form as a disguise since humans tend to kill dopplers. So the doppler changes into Dainty again, creating an exact copy of him, Dandelion and Geralt is astonished. Geralt then mentions that dopplers do not only copy the body, but the mind, the thoughts and the soul.
It then turns out that the doppler had sold the horses for an incredibly high price and reinvested all the money in a ton of stuff including cod liver oil, rose oil, mimosa bark, cochineal, earthenware bowls and beeswax. Dainty is devastated knowing that all this stuff are completely useless. Suddenly, the chamber door opened again and in came a man in a purple toga and a weird shaped hat asking for a merchant named Biberveldt. This triggered the doppler Dainty to fiercely run out of the tavern, Geralt follows. The purple man calls for help as the doppler forces his way through. The guard grabs Geralt, thinking that he is the bad guy and the doppler gets away.
Dainty then explains to the purple dressed man, whose name apparently was Schwann, that the doppler was his cousin Nutcase-Biberverldt and had an injury from his childhood that caused him to get infuriated by the color purple. Schwann believes the lie and then explains that Dainty has a tax debt of fifteen hundred gold, something that he'd never be able to pay. Dainty is yet again devastated.
Later that day, Dainty, Dandelion and Geralt gathered around a fountain. Dainty wanted to find that doppler but it didn't take long until they noticed they were surrounded. Men armed with lamias walk towards them. A man approach them, he had a white kaftan and a golden chain. Dandelion noticed that it was Chappelle. Chappelle starts talking about the doppler or the vexling as he calls it, in the tavern. He claims that anyone who says that they saw a vexling is blasphemous and a heretic who should be sent into the dungeon because the eternal fire is protecting Novigrad from monsters. The innkeeper was imprisoned because he claimed that.
A bit later he wants to talk a few private words with Geralt. Chappelle asks Geralt what the cost would be if there would be a vexling in the city. Geralt answered, "That question is impossible to answer". After a while of conversation, Chappelle finally decides to leave. He and his armed men walks away in an organized column.
Dandelion is relived but Dainty got his sight on Muskrat, a merchant he knew. Muskrat approached him. He is astonished but also angry, he tells him about the profit he made on the cochineal since there was a huge demand on it in the coup in Poviss. Dainty is shocked, he hastily makes his way to the bank in order to understand what is happening, Dandelion and Geralt followed too. Dainty met his bank companion Vimme Vivaldi and they got invited to his office. At the bank, the halfling finds out that the doppler had been here several times and that he had a wealthy amount of money on the bank by the cochineal profit. The tax was paid as well.
They then discuss some business and the Chappelle thing. Vimme Vivaldi said that Chappelle is following them because of his success in business lately since Chappelle usually is the one who is on top of business. Dainty then finds out that the doppler is at the west market. He asks for a stout robust stick and makes his way to the market hastily, leaving Vimme Vivalde without a doubt.
At the western market, the three companions split up in order to find the doppler. Geralt is desperately searching for the doppler but his attention got caught by Dandelion's voice, singing. Geralt finally finds him singing like a beggar on the street, a big crowd had gathered around him. Geralt walks up to him and asks what he is doing, but it did not take long until Vespula showed up, angry as usual. Dandelion jumped but it did not take long until Dainty came rushing in, bumping into Vespula and screaming. The halfling says he'd seen him.
After a bit of guiding from Dainty, he finally gets his eye on the doppler and they both ran after him. The Doppler at last ran into a butcher tent but Geralt, with the help of the Aard sign was able to trap him inside the tent. The Witcher did not want to kill him or turn him to the authority, instead he offered him to leave the town but the doppler did not approve of that. Instead, he started forming into the Witcher himself. They started fighting and both did exactly the same moves. The doppler said constantly that he can not defeat him, because they are exact copies. But Geralt knew better. He knew that the doppler did not have the courage to defeat him. That he did not have the courage to understand the bad in people, only the good, and that Geralt knew because he could have easily just killed and buried the merchant he decided to rob, and all his problems would have gone away, but he did not have the courage to do so. The doppler knew this, since he had the Witcher's thoughts and he understood. He now started to form into Dandelion instead and then explained that all he wanted was to be able to live in Novigrad, just like dwarves, halflings, gnomes and elves. Geralt put his sword back in the scabbard and watched him make his way on the street. The Doppler looked back and thanked him, played to chords on his lute and sang the last bit of Dandelion's ballad "Winter", but suddenly Vespula showed up.
She knocked him with a pan and he started deforming. A crowd was forming and Geralt tried to oust the attention. Suddenly, Chappelle shows up without any bodyguards at all. He approached the doppler and at the same time, Dainty showed up from another butcher tent, sweaty. Chappelle then tries to communicate with the deforming doppler assuming its name is Dudu. Geralt is watching Chappelle with narrow eyes, looking very suspicious. Finally, the doppler had changed to Dainty again, or Dainty's cousin as they say. The real Dainty is no longer angry on the doppler since his way of doing business is incredible and has granted him a lot of fame in his name. Chappelle pretty much revealed himself as a doppler himself and explains that the real Chapelle had died of apoplexy two months ago. Dudu then explains why he bought all those random stuff. It was revealed that you need all of those ingredients in order to make the eternal fire altars 
which they are going to start building soon in Novigrad.
After that, they all went together to the Passiflora and so the story ends.

A Little Sacrifice

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"A Little Sacrifice" (Polish: "Trochę poświęcenia") is a short story written by Andrzej Sapkowski and is the fourth story in "Sword of Destiny". It tells the tale of star-crossed trans-species lovers: a mermaid named Sh'eenaz and a human prince named Agloval.
Summary.
Agloval is the proud and arrogant prince of the seaside region of Bremervoord who is hopelessly in love with the mermaid, Sh'eenaz. The story opens with Geralt having been hired by Agloval to act as a translator since he can speak the Elder Language. Agloval wants Geralt to convince Sh'eenaz to trade her fin for a pair of human legs, abandon her life in the sea, and live with him on land. However Sh'eenaz refuses, and instead insists that it's Agloval who should instead come live with her, despite the fact that he can't breathe underwater. Ultimately, Geralt is unable to negotiate; Agloval argues that his contract is unfulfilled and refuses to pay.
During Geralt and Dandelion's visit in Bremervoord, they encounter the bard Essi Daven, a professional rival of Dandelion. During a betrothal feast where the bards have been hired to perform, Essi quickly develops strong feelings for Geralt, who handles this awkwardly by kissing her despite feeling nothing for her.
Agloval comes to the feast when he learns of the mysterious deaths of a number of local pearl divers. He hires Geralt to investigate. This leads to the discovery of a mysterious race of underwater dwellers. A war is narrowly averted between the people of the sea and their land-based counterparts when Sh'eenaz mysteriously intervenes and stops the conflict.
Later, Essi finds the pretty blue shell Dandelion picked up for her, although it's filled with muck. Surprisingly, it contains a valuable blue pearl. Essi confesses her love for Geralt, but he's unable to reciprocate. He feels discomfited, and wonders if Yennefer feels this uncomfortable with him. Geralt cannot muster any love or otherwise romantic feelings for Essi because she is not Yennefer, although he is unable to bring himself to explain this to her.
Meanwhile, Sh'eenaz has decided in the end to make "a little sacrifice" in the name of love and do as Agloval wishes. She has agreed to give up her tail fin and life as a mermaid in exchange for legs, so that she can live on land and marry her lover.
Geralt, Dandelion, and Essi leave Bremervoord together. But before going their separate ways, Geralt explains his feelings to Essi - that he does not reciprocate her love, and Essi comes to terms with this.
Dandelion composes a new ballad, one of a witcher and a bard who meet on a beach and fall in love at first sight; although Dandelion never performs this song for anyone. Sadly, Geralt and Essi never meet again. Four years later, Essi dies from smallpox in Vizima and Dandelion buries her with her lute and the blue pearl.
"The Witcher".
It is this short story to which the Lady of the Lake refers in Act IV of "The Witcher" when she mentions to Geralt that she has heard of him "on good authority".

The Sword of Destiny

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"The Sword of Destiny" (Polish: "Miecz przeznaczenia") is a short story written by Andrzej Sapkowski and is the fifth story in "Sword of Destiny". It is in this story that Geralt and Ciri, his law of surprise, are first introduced to one another.
Summary.
While on his way to Brokilon to deliver a message to the queen of the dryads, Eithné, from King Venzlav of Brugge, Geralt stumbles upon the body of a boy, probably no more than fifteen. The boy has been killed by an obviously expertly delivered arrow which can still be seen protruding from his skull.
Experience quickly makes it clear to the witcher what has happened: the boy had obviously strayed into territory claimed by the dryads. Like others who had suffered similar fates before, the scenario had likely been the same.
Warning shot. "Human! Not one step further!" 
The boy, probably panicked, ran the wrong way, further into the dryad's domain 
Another shot. This second shot, not a warning
A sad tale, too often repeated.
He hurries his pace, hoping to catch up with the people he has been following and convince them to turn back. Too late. He finds a second body, an adult male, and then a third. Then he hears a rustling noise. Locating its source, he discovers, much to his surprise, Freixenet. Freixenet is in bad shape, but his only concern seems to be that Geralt find "the princess".
As he tries to extract the large man from his hiding place, another arrow whizzes by narrowly missing the witcher's own head, then more. They are surrounded by dryads. Geralt realizes he has no choice but to surrender if there is any hope of surviving the encounter. He explains the original purpose of his unannounced arrival in Brokilon and manages to convince them that he must still speak with Eithné. They agree to escort him the rest of the way, and assign one of their ranks, Braenn to be his guide. He is immediately sent on his way and not permitted to speak with Freixenet again nor told what will happen to the man.
Geralt and Braenn then set off through the forest, on their way to Duén Canell. Along the way they come upon a giant centipede which seems to be threatening a halfling. Springing into action, the witcher tackles the beast. With the help of Braenn, they eventually dispatch the monster, only to realize that its intended victim was no halfling, but a little human girl, no more than 10 years old, the princess Cirilla of Cintra herself.
Realizing they cannot leave her there alone, the witcher and the dryad decide to take her with them. It is during this latter part of their journey that Geralt and Ciri get to know each other a little. It seems that Ciri had been sent to meet a prospective suitor, prince Kistrin, son of king Ervyll of Verden, by her grandmother, Calanthe. Ciri, however, had other ideas and ran away. Freixenet and his unfortunate party had been trying to find her to bring her back when they were ambushed by dryads.
Finally the trio arrive at the heart of Brokilon, Duén Canell, where they also find Freixenet. Although still a prisoner, his wounds are being treated by the dryads and he already seems a good deal better. The two men finally get a chance to speak and Freixenet fills Geralt in on the rest of the details of Ciri's adventure so far.
During the journey it has become increasingly clear that, this being Brokilon, Ciri will likely never be permitted to leave. So now, in addition to his original message, Geralt must now speak with Eithné about Ciri's fate as well. The queen of the dryads is proud and determined, not to mention particularly unsympathetic towards the humans who have relegated her people to one tiny patch of forest.
Ultimately, Eithné allows Ciri to choose her own fate and Ciri chooses the witcher. The queen also decides to spare Freixenet on the basis that he is an acquaintance of Geralt and that he did not have the intention of hunting dryads when he trespassed into the forest. After all, dryads still need males to make new dryads, so it seems that the large man will become a stud.
Back on his original route to Brugge, the witcher and his newest companion are surrounded by what seem to be a group of Verden soldiers. One of the group explains that what they have come upon is the scene of a dryad ambush of a merchant caravan. But Geralt quickly notices that the evidence around him does not support the claims being made by the "soldiers" and a fight ensues. Ciri manages to hide in a tree but the witcher is hopelessly outnumbered. Luckily, and at the last minute, he is saved by the arrival of Mousesack and some dryads.
The new party of three then continue on the road together as Geralt and Mousesack catch up with each other's news. The witcher then leaves Ciri in the care of her "uncle" Mousesack and continues on his way, much to the chagrin of the young girl.

Something More

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"Something More" (Polish: "Coś więcej") is a short story written by Andrzej Sapkowski and is the last story in "Sword of Destiny". It takes place after the fall of Cintra, as Geralt is on the road heading towards Cintra in hopes of finding Ciri.
Summary.
The story begins with a merchant, Yurga, alone on a crumbling bridge trying to fix the wheel of his cart which has become stuck in the rotting planks of the bridge. Below the bridge is a dry river bed covered in nettles and strewn with human remains, and worse still, he can hear the sounds of a horse approaching. He quickly hides under the tarp, hoping to escape detection. The horseman stops and seems to be aware that someone is hiding in the cart and calls out that he means no harm. After some reflection, Yurga decides to chance it and surfaces.
The horseman turns out to be a witcher; not just any witcher, but Geralt of Rivia himself. The two men discuss the merchant's predicament. Geralt remarks that the wagon is too big for the two of them to pull it free and asks if Yurga was traveling alone. The merchant admits that he did have two traveling companions, his servants Profit and Vell, who took flight leaving him to his own devices. Geralt then suggests simply abandoning the cart and getting to safety before whatever was responsible for the other bodies decides to make a feast of them, but Yurga won't hear of it. That cart is worth a year's income (at least) to him and he's not about to leave it. Geralt shrugs this off and makes to leave when Yurga begs him to help, saying that he'll give him whatever he desires.
Those are the magic words, the invoking of the Law of Surprise. Things settled, Geralt then suggests that Yurga get back in his cart and stay there quietly. He then prepares for the battle to come, and come it does. While Geralt does prevail, he is left gravely wounded and collapses after the fight. Yurga's servants return and help the merchant load the witcher onto the cart. Yurga, it turns out, is a good man and he undertakes to get the witcher to a healer. The rest of the story takes place as Geralt drifts in and out of consciousness on the road back to Yurga's house in Sodden.
He dreams of Yennefer and their last meeting during the Belleteyn holiday.
They cross the Trava and Geralt regains consciousness long enough for Yurga to explain that they are now out of Temeria and into Sodden. The witcher asks the merchant to hand him one of his potions, which he takes and slips back into unconsciousness. He dreams of the first time he returned to Cintra to claim Ciri, his surprise child from Duny and Pavetta. At first, Geralt does not know the gender of the child and assumes it is a boy. He asks Mousesack which of the gang of playing children is the one, but the druid tells him that Calanthe has forbidden him from telling the witcher. She doesn't want to give Ciri to the witchers and is making things as difficult as possible. The druid also reveals that Calanthe had hired him after the child was born to kill the witcher. At the last moment, she cancelled the plan without any explanation, but Mousesack admits that he would have done her bidding, or at least tried.
Geralt and Calanthe meet and have a protracted discussion about the Law of Surprise and whether or not she will give up the child, but in the end, the witcher explains that he doesn't believe in destiny. It's not enough, there must be something more. He tells the queen that he has no intention of taking Pavetta and Duny's son (as he still doesn't know that they had a daughter). They also discuss witchers and the trials as well as how Geralt himself became a witcher. Here we are told that Mousesack's assertions that Geralt was a surprise child are just stories, that Geralt was abandoned to the witchers by his mother, a sorceress.
The next scene opens at night as Geralt wakes up to find himself being treated by a sorceress and healer, Visenna. Up until this point, he had always wondered if he would ever cross paths with the woman who gave him up to the witchers. He had thought about her from time to time over the years contemplating what he would tell to her, what question he would ask should they ever meet. He assumed it would cause some twisted pleasure to him. Now that the meeting has happened, he's too tired and weak and plans to look her in the eyes and ask his question the next day in the daylight. However Visenna steers Geralt to rest stating he won't want that anymore when he's awake again. By asking rhetorical questions she further dismisses the idea of doing what he plans as it won't change anything. As she finally says a goodbye, Geralt tries to resist her soothing activity and prevent her from disappearing again, but fails.
In the following scene Geralt and Yurga hold a conversation about the aftermath of the "second battle of Sodden", Visenna's self-sacrifice while Geralt was unconscious and the locals' feelings towards mages, which stem from the experienced battle and its outcome. When Yurga mentions the number of the fallen mages, Geralt shows signs of instability. Enumerating the mages name by name makes Geralt stop his companion.
Some time after we have Geralt climbing up the Sodden hill towards an obelisk erected there, to read himself the names carved on it. Reading from top down reminiscing about the individuals, three names remain to be read and a rustle interrupts him. A blond haired lady passes by, radiating cold. She kneels down in front of the obelisk covering so the last name of a mage. They talk, he realizes who she is following him all the time. He is tired and peacefully asks about how it happens. She describes her duty. Geralt states he's been afraid of her, but he is not anymore. His appearance tells otherwise though. She challenges him to hear the last name, he says it himself and asks her to do her duty. She declines for today. He states she's taken all from him, but she interrupts him saying she doesn't take anything but hands to hold and accompany those alone, in a mist, which is what everything around fades to.
Yurga wakes Geralt up wondering why the witcher went up there, when he could have been told everything by Yurga. Geralt tests Yurga's memory by asking for the last name of the mage, it turnes out not to be who Geralt has thought. The scene ends by Geralt glancing at all the names on the menhir answering Yurga's question whether Geralt knew the last mage.
The journey continues, and while a good deal better, the witcher is still not out of the woods health-wise. Geralt continues to spend much of the trip resting. When they finally arrive in Sodden. Yurga proceeds to explain that it is more than just unlikely that the witcher will find what he asked for as a reward when they ultimately get there. He and his wife are well past their child-bearing years, so a new family addition is far from likely. They do, however, have two strong, bright sons and having one of them train to be a witcher would not be so bad. Geralt insists that for all the medical care and transportation that the merchant has provided, they are now even and that no further reward is required, but again Yurga proves obstinate and insists.
Just as the river Yaruga comes into view, Geralt slips into one final dream about the same crossing. In the dream, the witcher sees what looks like pandemonium on the banks. The crossing is the scene of quite a commotion as soldiers retreating from the Nilfgaardian assault are preventing peasants who are also trying to flee from crossing the river. The soldiers are intent on getting themselves across and then preventing the Nilfgaardians from following. They tell the peasants to get out their axes and build a raft if they want to cross, the ferry is the army's.
Amidst the furor, Geralt spies Dandelion who has apparently been abandoned along with a cartful of chickens and geese in cages. Geralt calls the bard over and helps him onto his horse and the two catch up on news, but the news is particularly bad. It seems that Cintra, the witcher's original destination on this trip, has been completely overrun by the enemy army and sacked. Worse still, it appears that the entire royal family was either massacred or chose to kill themselves rather than surrender. Calanthe is dead, and most likely Ciri. Since it appears that there is no longer any point to trying to reach Cintra, Geralt decides to join Dandelion and try to find a new crossing.
As they finally near the merchant's home, his wife, Złotolitka, comes running out to meet him, clearly thrilled that he has returned safe and sound. She does have a concern though. While he was away, she took in an extra child, a girl who had been orphaned. Surprise! And now she's worried that Yurga will be angry at having another mouth to feed. It does not take long for the children to come back and among them is a certain ash blonde haired girl with green eyes, Ciri. Geralt and Ciri run to each other and embrace like father and daughter. Ciri says, "It's just like they predicted, Geralt! Like they predicted... I'm your destiny? Say it! I'm your destiny?" In reply Geralt says, "You're more than that, Ciri. Much more."

This story was loosely adapted as "Ciri", the final episode of "The Hexer" television series.

<doc id="5062" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5062" title="Witcher medallion">
Witcher medallion

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
 A witcher medallion is a silver symbol of the witchers' profession. Each one is shaped to represent the school a witcher comes from. It is sensitive to magic, vibrating and tugging on its chain when spells are being cast or magical beings, like genies or even mages, are present. This magic medallion is given to every young witcher candidate who has passed the Trial of the Grasses. The origin of the first medallions is unknown, though it is assumed they were made in the magic forge at Kaer Morhen. The medallions vibrate in response to magic in all its forms, including curses, charms, and spells. They also warn of lurking monsters born of magic or magic experimentation. However, witcher medallions are not foolproof, certain monsters such as dopplers and higher vampires remain undetected whenever in range of a medallion.
The witcher medallion is not only an insignia of our profession, it is also one of its tools. It has numerous useful capabilities that are accessible, of course, only to one who possesses the necessary knowledge and training. First of all, it reacts to the presence of sorcerous auras in the immediate surroundings, making us aware of nearby spellcasting, active illusions, or magical creatures. It also warns the owner of sudden dangers, thus providing an additional moment to react. Keep in mind, though, that the medallion is not infallible. A very strong magical aura, such as those found in Places of Power or during the solstices, can provoke aberrant reactions. In large cities, where people widely use simple magical amulets or sorcerous alarm systems to protect their homes, coin, or ruttish wives, the medallion can also behave abnormally.- Vesemir,  "The World of the Witcher"
"The Witcher".
In "The Witcher", Geralt's medallion can be tuned to detect either or magic. This particular screen can be found while Geralt is meditating, by clicking on the Inventory icon.
If the medallion is tuned to detect monsters, it will vibrate whenever a monster is near. When the monster is very close, there will also be a red haze around the left side of the screen, and the medallion will vibrate quite violently.
If the medallion is tuned to detect magic, then it will vibrate in the same manner when in proximity to a Place of Power.
Finally, the ring around the medallion in the game interface (upper left corner) shows the icons for active effects and a progress bar for XP.
The medallion emits an audible vibration when in the presence of magic. It can be used when energized, as indicated by a pulsating yellow aura. Using the causes the medallion to highlight items such as plants, , , and containers in orange, and Circles of Power in red; this function is extremely helpful in cluttered and overgrown areas. Surrounding the medallion are the player's various level indicators:
In the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the medallion has a diminished role, being largely replaced by witcher senses, an ability that wasn't present in previous installments of the trilogy. Though it gets mentioned when Geralt talks to someone generating magic such as a cursed being, and vibrates infrequently (whether pointing out a clue or warning of danger) as the player explores the world.

<doc id="5064" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5064" title="Meditation">
Meditation

In the novels, while it is mentioned that Geralt meditates, this is not a huge part of the narrative.
"The Witcher".
In "The Witcher", Geralt does not need to sleep when tired, but he "must meditate" in order to allocate accrued talents as well as for any creation of bombs, oils or potions. In order to meditate, he must either light a campfire, a fireplace, or choose to meditate via conversation (typically with an innkeeper, but some other s also offer this convenience).
The slider to the right of the hourglass is used to select how long (in number of hours) Geralt should meditate. Alternatively, one of the four "time of day" icons can be selected to meditate "until dawn", "until midday", "until dusk" or "until midnight".
Clicking on the hourglass in the center initiates the period of meditation.
Meditation will typically restore your health and endurance, as well as cleanse you of toxicity and intoxication. If you meditate outdoors, one hour is enough to restore you to full vigor; meditating indoors will heal you much more slowly.
Note: If Geralt is brewing potions (or making other alchemical items), or allocating talents, the hour necessary for brewing potions or allocating the talents is automatically added to the number of hours remaining until the desired time of day. So be careful when trying to make a specific appointment.
To enter meditation mode, use to open the Quick Menu, then press on the center symbol.
Unlike the original game, Geralt can meditate anywhere as long as there are no enemies about. However, he must enter meditation mode to drink potions.
In the third game, Geralt can meditate anywhere to regain vitality, as long as he is outside of combat. To meditate, hold and then press the . You could also just press the key without going into the quick menu. He does not have to meditate to level up or create potions.
Geralt's potions and bombs will also be restocked after meditating for at least one hour, and if he has alcohol in his inventory. White Gull will be consumed first, then alcohest, then dwarven spirit. "Note:" if playing on or , vitality will not be restored upon meditation.

The Witcher combat

Attacking is one of the main things Geralt does in the game. Whether he defends the honour of a damsel in distress, or just defends himself from monsters, it is a good thing his swords are on his back at all times. He is usually called upon with no notice to draw steel, or silver, on his daily Path.
"For attack information, see :Attack."
Mechanics.
Basics.
First, draw your sword, unless it is a fistfight. If you have a choice and are dealing with humans or non-monstrous, natural beings (e.g. wolves and dogs), use your steel sword. Otherwise, use your silver sword. Both are deadly.
A successful single-click attack actually looks like a sequence of multiple maneuvers, performed automatically by Geralt. If clicked in the midst of action, Geralt ceases to do anything and brief time penalty is applied before he could restart attacking. Thus, the worst course of actions in the sword fight is impatient rapid clicking on enemy. Mentioned sequence is not to be confused with Chained attacks, which basically is a succession of such sequences and is described later in the article.
There is a usual "chance-to-hit" mechanism in the game's engine, which determines the outcome of particular attack attempt. Multiple factors substitute (e.g. character's "attack" dexterity-related attribute, enemy's ability to dodge and parry, timings of actual blows, etc.)
If attack fails due to opponent's agility Geralt halts, backing his sword, and the word "Dodge" or "Parry", correspondingly, briefly pops up above the enemy. Immediate resumption of single attack-clicking is advised in this case to prevent the enemy from retaliating and keeping one busy dodging/parrying.
Evading enemies.
Geralt's evasive maneuvers are fun to do, even if only to see what he can do. He is quite the acrobat, doing flips and somersaults whenever necessary. In isometric camera modes:
Geralt can only do evasive maneuvers while a weapon is drawn.
Active pause.
During combat, this is an especially useful option. Use the active pause to switch between combat styles when fighting a group of opponents. As the fight progresses and Geralt works his witcher magic with the sword, the group of opponents gets whittled down to two sorry fighters, and then finally just one. When he is down to just two opponents, it becomes less and less useful to use the Group Style. It can still be effective, but only if the two bad guys are optimally placed in relation to him. Focusing on more adversary-specific combat styles, like Fast or Strong Style, makes more sense and it is at this point that active pause comes in very handy.
It is also extremely useful to simply pause the game at (almost) any point. Cut scenes are an obvious exception as are some predetermined parts of some conversations with NPCs.
Chaining attacks.
After successful completion of a single attack sequence (see Basics), a player is given an opportunity (described below) to keep on with another added, or, "chained" attack sequence with ever more increasing efficiency (greater damage and added bonuses, depending on Witcher fighting styles). The chain of sequences is limited to a certain number, determined solely by development of talents devoted to fighting styles. The last sequence allowed is called "Final attack" and is followed by camera shaking to show things're going serious.
Make sure that you maximize your efficiency in combat by using as many skills as you have at your disposal. New and more complex chains of attack may be observed if player chooses to develop fighting styles as Geralt goes up in levels.
The Game gives certain hints, when chaining is due:
Tip: Chaining attacks requires precise timing. Clicking too soon will disrupt an attack, and clicking too late will restart the attack sequence. Drinking Blizzard potions requires an adjustment of timing; watching for the trails and listening for the whistling can help.
Tip: Player does not have to chain the sequence against a single opponent - once chaining becomes possible, the player may click on another foe "in the immediate vicinity" to keep on chaining attacks. This way, if the original adversary dies before the final attack is achieved, it is possible to redirect accumulated destructive power upon another foe.
Combat styles.
Different adversaries require different approaches:
Coups de grâce.
You have just stunned your opponent.
A coup de grâce is a great way of finishing off an opponent and getting a show all at the same time. As Geralt acquires more talents, he also acquires more finishing moves. These can be quite entertaining to watch.
Tip: Attacks can cause critical effects like Stun, Bleeding and Pain.

<doc id="5075" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5075" title="Blacksmith">
Blacksmith

Blacksmiths (and in some cases armourers) can forge new swords from pieces of meteorite ore, or brand silver swords with mystical runes to enhance their statistics. They also occasionally make, sell or buy an amazing variety of other goods.
"The Witcher".
There are several blacksmiths in "The Witcher":
Mechanics.
You need at least three pieces of meteorite to forge a new steel sword. Blacksmiths can also burn runes into your silver sword. You need at least three runes to have them branded into a blade.
Some players find it strange that the screen is the same as the buy/sell screen, but this should not be a concern, it is indeed the reforging screen. Essentially, you trade in your three pieces of meteorite or your three runes for a new sword.
Note that due to an exploitable game mechanic, it is possible to keep your meteorite pieces. To do this, open the forging screen, drop all your meteorites, and buy the meteorite sword you want. Remember to pick the meteorites up again before leaving the area!
You can also make other transactions in the "Forge" screen, like buying and selling items.
Order armorer:
Malcolm Stein ("aka" the dwarven blacksmith):
Notes.
Many thanks to on the Witcher Forum for investigating and documenting these situations.
Only a blacksmith can craft weapons in ". Geralt of Rivia will have to bring the required materials to a blacksmith to have new professionally crafted swords and crossbows. Similarly, armor can only be forged by Armorers. It is also better to sell weapons, upgrades, and horse equipment to blacksmiths because they offer an extra +20% profit compared to other types of shopkeepers.

<doc id="5077" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5077" title="Campfires">
Campfires

Campfires and fireplaces are found scattered about the landscape in "The Witcher". They provide convenient and free places for Geralt to rest and also indulge in a little alchemy. Most of these look the same, but some are a bit different. For example, some areas look more like roasting pits but still can be used the same way. Of course the reverse is also true, especially with fireplaces, most fireplaces are not "usable", but some are. Holding down the Alt-key will reveal any usable fire sources, along with anything else that is "click-able" in the area.
 
Mechanics.
Fires that are already lit:
When Geralt first enters an area, you will notice that all available campfires are lit. This is very handy in finding them (as are the maps). On subsequent visits, these fire sources are not generally lit.
Safe areas:

"The Witcher".
In "The Witcher", the player character, Geralt, advances or develops as accumulated experience points earn him talents which can be allocated to various attributes. There are four main attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Stamina and Intelligence. These four in turn allow advancement of skills like signs and the mastery of steel and silver swords. The Hero panel displays each attribute and ability in 'tree' format.
Progress through the game (as represented by experience points/levels and the consumption of unique potions) earns talent points of the Bronze (attribute levels I-II), Silver (levels III-IV) and/or Gold (level V) varieties. These talents are used to improve Geralt's abilities, which include:

Similarly to the original game, Geralt earns talent points whenever XP adds up to a new level. These points may be distributed among the four branches of the skill tree:
Some of these skills can be enhanced further with mutagens.

The Witcher fistfighting

Fistfighting is a skill which is not only useful for self-defense and a bit of exercise, but also for earning orens. In "The Witcher", you can earn some easy gold by challenging the steady crop of fighters found loitering at all the local inns and taverns to fights.
There are "title fights", where you work your way up in fame through the Fistfight quest and win more than just gold, as well as any number of non-title matches which are strictly for cash. Just click on the potential opponent as you would to speak to any other game character, negotiate your wager and commence fighting.
Wagers.
Do not get excited. You can only wager on your own fights. It might be fun to speculate on the outcome of other fistfights, but that is not part of this game.
When making a wager, it is always good to maximize your potential winnings (since winning is pretty much a given, see Fistfighting made easy). "Title" fighters will not negotiate their wagers, but you can bet between the following amounts of money for generic fighters:
Mechanics.
To initiate the fight, click on the Fistfight icon during dialogue:

Inns and taverns

Inns and taverns play a significant role in the Witcher universe. The very first story about the witcher begins with Geralt entering Vizima and heading straight for The Fox, one of the two taverns in town. Many telling conversations between Geralt and the people he meets take place at the local inn, both in the novels and in the game.
"The Witcher".
In "The Witcher", inns and taverns are found throughout the game, except in Chapter V, the Epilogue, and "The Price of Neutrality." They are excellent places to store, or retrieve, items which are of no immediate use and therefore cluttering up precious inventory slots and to buy or sell other items, like alcohol for potion making, or food. They can also be used as places to meditate which is also necessary in potion making.
They are also social places where one can find entertainment, fistfighting and gambling.
Buying and selling.
Typically these transactions are handled by the waitresses. Just initiate conversation with the waitress and then either ask her using a conversation option what she sells, or just click on the buy/sell icon during dialogue mode. This will open a panel showing you what she has to sell. Also, items she is willing to buy will be highlighted in your own inventory panel on the same screen.
Typical wares include food, drink, as well as some grease. Just double-click on an item to either buy or sell. Happy transacting!
Notes.
In the second game, there is always a Notice Board in front, near the entrance of an inn. There are two proper inns and one area that functions as an inn since it doesn't even have a door or a roof. Inns and taverns offer storage that carries over its content throughout all three chapters.
Locations.
In the third game, inns and taverns provide food and drink and Geralt can challenge innkeeps at gwent.

There are many elven ruins on the continent. Later, humans built their own cities on those ruins, much to the disgust of the elves. So much so that the elves began sacking their own cities as they left them rather than leaving them to be contaminated by humans.

As Vizima was built on elven foundations, the sewers of the Trade Quarter not only boast the usual complement of monsters, but also the ruins of an ancient elven temple.

Beau Berrant was a Novigradian trade broker and the free city's honorary ambassador in Rinde.
Biography.
He was living in Rinde during King Heribert's reign, making the Redanian city hostile to magic and mages in general. However, as he was an honorary ambassador, his place was untouchable and thus Yennefer of Vengerberg stayed for a time at his place.
It was during this time that Dandelion was badly injured by a djinn and Geralt rushed to the the nearest city, Rinde, to find help. When he learned the only known mage in the area was at Beau's place, he broke in to ask her for help and found Beau drunk and naked in the kitchen, muttering that the sorceress wanted apple juice but he passed out while trying to get her some.

Biography.
While Yennefer of Vengerberg was staying at Beau's place, Geralt required her assistance to help him heal Dandelion, who'd been badly injured by a djinn and so appeared in the early hours of the morning at Beau's place. However, Cerberus refused to let him enter, even when Geralt offered coin, and so the witcher used the coin pouch to knock out Cerberus to gain access to the house and moved his unconscious body into a nearby room.

Errdil was an elf living in the Redanian city of Rinde, having moved there with his quiet, taciturn wife and his cousin Chireadan. He bought an inn, intending to renovate it, however, when Yennefer attempted to capture a djinn by luring it to the inn, the inn was destroyed in the ensuing fight. Luckily for Errdil, he had the place well insured before it was destroyed.

Vratimir was a human-looking knight with salt-and-pepper hair who befriended Chireadan and Errdil, the latter to the point of helping him renovate his inn in Rinde. Geralt met the trio outside the gates of Rinde.
Dandelion was desperately injured and needed attention, but no one could enter the city after dusk, so the witcher and his sick friend waited in the barbican along with other travelers waiting to enter. When Geralt first spotted the knight he thought Vratimir might be able to help them get into the city before dawn. However, the slash across the knight's coat of arms dashed those hopes as they signaled Vratimir was illegitimate and the result of a human/non-human union, knocking his status down enough that he had to wait with the rest of them.

Biography.
In 1252, while on patrol with two of his fellow guardsman, the trio were alerted to a fight in The Fox inn. Upon inspection, the witcher Geralt of Rivia was found surrounded by corpses. Using caution in arresting him, one of his fellow guardsman directed Treska to fetch some more guards, but Geralt submitted and used the Axii sign to convince them to take him to Castellan Velerad, who then dismissed the three.

The Merchants' Gate, the eastern gate of Vizima, is where Geralt first encountered Mikul, one of the Outskirts' most prominent citizens, at least according to the Reverend. The Merchants' Bridge leading up to it was also the scene of a Salamandra ambush involving Kalkstein.
These gates remained locked for the duration of the game. Although Geralt did see both sides of them, he never actually passed through them.

"The Witcher".
The Maribor gate dominates the view to the north of the main village in the Outskirts, but offers no easier entry into Vizima than any other gate. The two city guards flanking the gates doggedly stick to their script: show your pass to Mikul, or get lost.
From the Trade Quarter, this gate is no more passable. From inside the city, the gate is also guarded and even more heavily, so I guess leaving is frowned upon as much as entering.

Genie

Genie is a hypernym used to refer to the inhabitants of the elemental planes of the forces of nature: Earth, Air, Water, Fire. The genies can be divided according to those four Principles:
The priest Krepp explains to the mayor of Rinde, and anyone else who will listen, just what genies are."Going back to genies, there are four sorts, just as there are four Planes. Djinns are air creatures; marides are associated with the principle of water; afreet are Fire genies and d'ao, the genies of Earth—...Word has it old Monck had a way of forcing a djinn to serve him. There were rumours that he had more than one. He was said to keep them in bottles and make use of them when need arose. Three wishes from each genie, then it's free and escapes into its own dimension." pg.250 - 251, "The Last Wish" (UK edition)

D'ao

D'ao is the name for the elemental genie of earth. Herbert Stammelford, a mage, moved a mountain with the help of a d'ao, according to legends.
Large golems fueled by the element of Earth, that is the Earth Elementals, are sometimes dubbed d'ao, but have nothing in common with the real ones.
D'ao is a legendary monster of elementa class. It is a very strong opponent, vurnerable only to Dimeritium. It is depicted as a gigantic creature which body is made of stones and tree branches. It uses a stone slab as a shield and attacks with its fist.
 "The only recorded case of a moved mountain mentiones the Mahakam peak named Aar, under which d'ao had buried an elven palace, Muire Deith."

Djinn

Djinn, D'jinni or Djinniah is the name given to an elemental genie of Air.
Much the same as in fairy tales, Djinns are powerful creatures that are capable of great feats. Once captured, they are then bound to the captor and have to fulfill three wishes. Following their completion, they are free once more.
Andrzej Sapkowski.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
"The pitcher emitted a puff of glowing red smoke. The smoke pulsated, then gathered up into an irregular sphere floating in front of the poet's head...–The First Longing, a Tale Fantastic in All Ways."
"A djinn is a powerful air spirit, a condensation of the power of that element endowed with consciousness and character - the latter usually nasty. According to legend, djinn can grant even the most far-fetched wishes, though they do so very begrudgingly."
"Unusually powerful mages can capture and tame these beings. The mage can then draw on its energy, using it to cast spells without having to call on Power from traditional sources. Only a sparse handful have managed this feat, however, for djinn fight to avoid such a fate with stubborn determination. To imprison a djinn and bend it to one's will, one must first weaken it - and that is no easy feat."
"Fighting a djinn is extraordinarily difficult. They can fling off spells in an instant that the most accomplished human mages could never cast with years of preparation. What's more, by manipulating the element of air they can summon powerful storms, hurricanes, and gales. Luckily, as magic beings, they are vulnerable to silver - yet steel will do them no harm."
Combat tactics.
Fighting a djinn is about working quickly, and not something a witcher should attempt without good cause, or good pay. If you must face a djinn, dimeritium bombs are too useful to go without, giving a witcher the chance to close the distance without being frozen, burned, or electrocuted. Djinn can teleport short distances to escape harm, even after being affected by dimeritium bombs. A witcher must be able to quickly react to this and continue to pressure the djinn, using additional bombs as necessary to continue suppressing spells.
The closer a djinn is to death or capture, the more dangerous it becomes. The massive area-of-effect spells it can cast come faster, and it may teleport more often the more desperate it becomes. The Aard and Igni signs empower a djinn greatly, while Axii and Yrden calm it down and make it easier to combat.
It is highly recommended to turn OFF level upscaling before this fight, as the Djinn will do multi hit lightning strikes, an unblockable lightning area-of-effect and a ranged icicle attack, which are all individually able to one-hit-kill Geralt if upscaled to his level, while it will take over 100 attacks for Geralt to deplete its HP bar under these circumstances, making the fight either impossible, or very close to it.

The Howling is a quest in "The Price of Neutrality" premium module.
Walkthrough.
On his way to Kaer Morhen, Geralt stumbles upon the encampment of Prince Merwin Ademeyn and his entourage. Most prominent in this entourage is the sorceress, Sabrina Glevissig. In getting to know the camp inhabitants and their purpose for being at Kaer Morhen, Geralt learns of Deidre, sister of Prince Merwin. He also learns that the hunting party is basically hunting Deidre.
Geralt decides to get more detailed information from Sabrina and it is in the course of this conversation that she intimates that she requires the livers of 20 wolves. Since wolves are constantly attacking the campsite, this should prove to be a trivial task.
Phases.
The Liver of the Beast.
Sabrina asked me to bring her 20 lupine livers. I need to go on a wolf hunt. "I need to slay 20 wolves and bring Sabrina their livers."
Booty.
I managed to gather many wolf livers. Sabrina should be satisfied. "I should take the livers to Sabrina."
Gratitude.
Sabrina was grateful for the wolf livers and rewarded me generously. "I believe Sabrina is grateful to me."
Failed quest.
It was a good day for the wolves. I won't have a chance to complete that assignment. "I lost my chance to complete that assignment."

Hungry Like a Wolf is a quest in "The Price of Neutrality" premium module.
Walkthrough.
When Geralt first arrives at Kaer Morhen, he finds a young woman, Deidre, has been wintering there with the witchers. It seems that she is being pursued by her brother, Prince Merwin Ademeyn and a sorceress, Sabrina Glevissig. She is also accompanied by two devoted wolves, D'yaebl and Beann'shie, who refuse to leave her side, even to feed.
To keep the wolves from starving, she asks Geralt to procure three portions of wyvern meat to feed them.
Phases.
Meat for the Wolves.
Deidre asked me to bring her wolves some wyvern meat. She needs three portions. I saw some wyverns on the way in to Kaer Morhen. They were north of here, by the river bend. "I need to bring Deidre three portions of wyvern meat."
The Catch.
I managed to hunt down some wyverns. Deidre will be happy to get his meat. "I need to get this meat to Deidre."
Gratitude.
Deidre was grateful for my help and gave me a rune stone as a reward. "Deidre is grateful to me."
Failed quest.
I lost my chance to complete that assignment. "I can forget the wyvern meat."

"The She-Wolf" is the main quest in "The Price of Neutrality" premium module for "The Witcher". Geralt receives it automatically after the opening sequence when he meets both Sabrina and Merwyn.
Walkthrough.
The opening of this quest finds Geralt coming back to the witchers' base of operations for the winter when he unexpectedly spies a small camp just outside the stronghold. This comes as quite a surprise since the way to Kaer Morhen is a closely guarded secret. One could count on one hand the number of non-witchers who know the way.
At the camp, Geralt meets a nobleman named Merwin Ademeyn and a sorceress named Sabrina Glevissig, who, along with a band of hired mercenaries, are trying to find a young woman, Deidre, staying in the stronghold. Deidre was allegedly born under the Black Sun and prophesied to ruin the world. She is also Eskel's surprise child and rightful heir to the throne of her own country, Caingorn. Her brother, the nobleman who also happens to be second in line, wants to make sure she will not have the crown. Sabrina wants to kill her as well, but for her own reasons. She wants to examine the girl's body and discover the "truth" about the curse. Being the witcher, Geralt has to choose with whom he sides.
Geralt has ample opportunity to consult with this fellow witchers: Eskel, Lambert and Vesemir who are all wintering at the old fortress. He will also have time to get to know both Deidre and Sabrina much better before finally making his decision. He is periodically thwarted by the abundant wolves, archespores, echinopsae, giant centipedes, kikimores, wyverns and basilisks who now inhabit that valley in addition to the witchers and their unexpected guests.
The quest takes our hero the length and breadth of Kaer Morhen valley, across both fords and into an old mine. The mine was previously considered abandoned, but apparently it makes an excellent nursery for kikimore cocoons. It is, however, where Eskel is hiding out and therefore unavoidable as a destination. His information is key to figuring out what to do about Deidre.
This quest frames the whole module. It is the plot of "The Price of Neutrality".
Phases.
A Mysterious Camp.
I was returning to Kaer Morhen for the winter. In the valley, by the river, I encountered a camp. It might be worth knowing who these people are. "I need to explore the camp near Kaer Morhen."
The Pack Attacks.
The pack attacked, interrupting our conversation. "I must defend the camp from the wolves."
Pack Eliminated.
I was able to slay the wolves that attacked the camp near Kaer Morhen. I should speak with the visitors and then with the witchers. Maybe I can learn what we owe this unexpected visit to. "I need to learn the reasons for the unexpected visit."
The Sorceress.
Sabrina Glevissig told me of the girl who is hiding inside Kaer Morhen. The sorceress believes her to be a dangerous mutant and needs to confirm her suspicion. I need to find Vesemir. "Time to talk to Vesemir."
Talking to Lambert.
Lambert said the witchers know about the uninvited guests and fear the intruders might bring trouble to Kaer Morhen. I should go to the fortress and speak with Vesemir. "I need to find Vesemir."
Years ago, a mob attacked Kaer Morhen and massacred the witchers holed up here. Since the [], echinopsae and archespores have been sprouting regularly in the area. I've got to help Lambert weed some of them out. "I need to help Lambert do some weeding."or
I left Lambert to fight the archespores alone. I should go back and help him.
I had a change of heart so I'm back to help Lambert with the archespores. "I've come back to help Lambert."
Victory.
The area around the ford is clear. Lambert will keep an eye on the intruders. It's about time I spoke with Vesemir and Eskel. "I should speak with Vesemir and Eskel."
Voice of decision.
Vesemir want us to decide. We must make decision what to do with a girl. "We must make decision what to do with a girl."
A Different Point of View.
Vesemir believes that we witchers should remain neutral on the Deidre issue. He asked me to speak with Eskel, who is in a mine exterminating kikimores. "I need to talk to Eskel."
Kikimores.
I need to help Eskel exterminate the kikimores. I can use the Aard sign to destroy their cocoons, but it'll be a hard fight with the ones that have managed to hatch. "I need to exterminate any kikimores that have hatched and destroy their cocoons using the Aard sign."
The First Chamber.
We're done with one chamber. Shouldn't see any more kikimores coming out of that cave. Eskel and I took a break and talked. Now we need to clear the other caverns. "We managed to clear one cave. We need to press on."
The Second Chamber.
We've cleared another chamber. Before we entered it, Eskel told me a bit about his Unexpected Child. "We need to clear the final chamber of kikimores."
Kikimores Exterminated.
We managed to clear the caverns of kikimores. Eskel would like all the witchers to decide about Deidre. He asked me to learn as much as possible about the girl and the other visitors to the valley. "I need to learn as much as I can about Deidre and the other visitors."
We decided to protect Eskel's Unexpected Child from her pursuers. Vesemir is unhappy to be breaking with our neutrality, but he said he would go with our decision. "We need to speak with Deidre."or
We decided to take the witchers' way and remain neutral. I need to help Eskel by talking to Deidre. "I need to speak with Deidre."
Involved path.
Talking to Deidre.
We managed to convince Deidre that she can only resolve this conflict by giving up her claims to her father's titles and estates. Now we need to persuade her brother. "We need to see Merwin Ademeyn at the camp." 
Hard Negotiating.
Merwin agreed to our conditions, but Sabrina intervened, destroying everything. Deidre lost control, wounded Eskel, and killed the commander of the mercenaries. I need to catch up to Deidre, who has entered Sabrina's tent. "I need to catch Deidre. She just entered Sabrina's tent."
Hostages.
Deidre wants to slay her brother and the sorceress. But there has been enough bloodshed. I need to convince Deidre to lay down her weapon. "I need to calm Deidre and prevent further bloodshed."
Deidre has left me no choice but to fight her. Perhaps that will be best for all involved. "I have no choice, I must kill Deidre."or
I managed to convince the girl that further bloodshed would change nothing. Sabrina Glevissig escaped, and Mervin Ademeyn survived. "I managed to prevent any further bloodshed."
The she-wolf is dead at my hand. Perhaps there was no exaggeration in the the claims about the curse that held her. "Deidre is dead. Maybe now the intruders will leave the valley."
Neutral path.
Hatred.
As expected, Deidre was not about to be persuaded. My medallion trembled as the girl exploded, screaming something about hatred, disdain, about those killed when the witchers were massacred. Suddenly, all around me sprouted archespores, these monstrous plants that grow on the bones of the murdered. "I must weed out these archespores that feed off the bones of those murdered when the witchers were massacred."
Victory.
We managed to defeat the beastly plants, but Deidre seriously wounded Eskel and fled. "I need to find help for Eskel."
The Sorceress.
Vesemir confirmed my fears — we cannot treat Eskel using just potions. We need to ask Sabrina for help. "I must go to the sorceress and ask her to help Eskel."
The sorceress demanded that we deny any links to Deidre. I had to agree to save Eskel. "I had to agree to Sabrina's conditions."or
The Law of Surprise is more than just words and I think Sabrina understands that. I didn't expect this, but she agreed to help Eskel even though we refused to agree to her conditions. "Sabrina agreed to help Eskel even though we refused to abide by her conditions."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Deidre of House of Ademeyn was a princess that had the great misfortune of being born during a total eclipse.
Deidre Ademyne was Eskel's surprise child. She became Eskel's "Unexpected Child", as Vesemir put it, when the witcher saved her father's, then the prince of Caingorn, life. In gratitude, the prince promised Eskel "that which he would find but did not expect" when he returned home. This, as it turned out was the pregnancy of his wife, and therefore Deidre. Because of this Eskel and the girl shared a special bond. For example, Deidre said that she needed to only think of Eskel to know exactly where he was at any given time. She said they are bound by Destiny. Despite this, for unknown reasons Eskel did not end up claiming her, taking great effort to avoid Caingorn altogether, riding around it each time he was passing through.
Deidre was first in line to inherit the titles of her recently deceased father. It appeared the elder Ademeyn succumbed to syphilis. The second in line, her brother, Merwin Ademeyn, a nobleman on King Henselt's council, did not want her to rule as he believed she was not fit. He seemed quite willing to make sure she would not have the crown, enlisting the help of a powerful sorceress.
The sorceress, Sabrina Glevissig, said Deidre had been affected by the Curse of the Black Sun. Sabrina wanted to kill the princess as well to examine her body and discover the "truth" about the Black Sun for the Council of Mages.
Deidre was born during an eclipse, and this is why she was considered to be affected by the so-called Curse of the Black Sun. She appeared completely normal, but she did emit an aura which had apparently been increasing in power over the years. This aura prevented magic from being used in her presence, and this included witchers' signs as well as spells cast by other magic users. Deidre herself said that her aura also dispelled previously cast spells when she was present.
From Merwin, we heard a sad tale from Deidre's childhood. It seemed that at the age of 12 she was raped by a charlatan claiming to be a mage. Actually, he claimed to be an altogether different kind of specialist: an oneiromancer, or diviner of dreams. This "mage" claimed that he needed to spend a night in Deidre's chamber as she slept. He would mix a brew designed to amplify her dreams. The old man could barely walk, had a beard down to his waist... Deidre's family suspected nothing.
He seemed to do as he claimed he would. By morning he was gone, but several valuable items had also disappeared from Deidre's chamber, including her favorite mother of pearl comb... Only the laundresses in the outskirts saw the miscreant, claiming that he fled as if chased by demons.
The prince ordered a search, but it was too late. Her father, who had hired the mage, refused to believe her claims of rape, saying that the cheat was an old man... And the bed linens betrayed nothing... This caused Deidre to flee assisted by "a young stable boy described as "an excessively broad-shouldered oaf". This could have been Roben, a man later described as a lover of both Deidre and Sabrina Glevissig, depending on whom you believe.
A search party was organized to find the youngsters, but they had disappeared without a trace. A week later, folk inhabiting the area where he was found claimed to have seen a young girl and boy ride through on large wolves... the stuff of fairy tales. The charlatan was ultimately found dead, having had his "manhood" removed. The implication being, of course that Deidre exacted her revenge.
After some time passed, Deidre returned to the castle. From then on her father ordered the dogs set upon any mages that approached, assuming that any true sorcerer would surely manage to avoid a few bear-hunting hounds... And then Sabrina appeared.
Deidre can be found inside the walls of Kaer Morhen where the witchers have taken her in when she fled to it for Eskel's help. She camps in the inner courtyard, accompanied by her faithful companions, Beann'shie and D'yaebl.
"If Witchers decide to interneve:" To negotiate with Sabrina and Merwin, witchers and Deidre went to the mercenary camp. Though the hostility between two woman was too high, thus resulting in a conflict in which Deidre accidentally slashes Eskel's face. With all mercenaries slain, Merwin and Sabrina ran to the latter's tent. "If Geralt orders Sabrina to leave:" With Sabrina not holding the ropes anymore, Merwin and Deidre set aside differences and ruled Caingorn together. Some time later Deidre sends Eskel a letter from Caingorn, which he places into the fire without reading it. "If Geralt orders Deidre to put down her sword:" Geralt engages in a fight with Deidre, thus killing her and ending this long lasting conflict. Merwin couldn't rule Caingorn well enough and Caingorn became completely dependent to the Kaedwen.
"If Witchers decide to stay neutral:" It was in witchers' code to not meddle in human affairs. Eskel and Geralt went to reason with Deidre to leave the castle, much to her hatred. In her rage, she stabbed Eskel in the gut and slashed his face. She summoned archespores from the souls of the fallen during the assault at Kaer Morhen, and fled the castle. She became known for her cruelty over the next two years, terrorizing southern Kaedwen with an army of bandits. "If the Witchers give Sabrina permission to hunt Deidre:" One day Deidre got caught by Sabrina and her forces, she was tortured and executed with an autopsy showing that there was no mutations in her. "If the Witchers refuse to forsake Deidre's fate to Sabrina:" One day Deidre is caught by a mysterious man with a terribly scarred face, she was killed outright and he didn't collect a coin of the sizable bounty that had accumulated on her over the years.
"Merwin Ademeyn admits that as the first-born child, Deidre is legally entitled to inherit all titles and estates from their father. However, he simultaneously claims that she has lost that right and certainly should not rule given that she is a cruel changeling."
"According to the sorceress Sabrina Glevissig, Deidre Ademeyne has been affected by the Curse of the Black Sun, rendering her a mutant both cruel and evil."
"Deidre became Eskel's Unexpected Child when the witcher saved her father's life. In gratitude, the prince of Caingorn promised Eskel whatever unexpected thing he found when he returned home. Eskel and the girl share a special bond, some might even say they are bound by Destiny."

Merwin Ademeyn

Merwin Ademeyn of House of Ademeyn is a character in "The Witcher"'s "The Price of Neutrality" premium module. He is a recently appointed royal courtier who has pursued his elder sister Deidre all the way to Kaer Morhen, considering her to be a dangerous mutant. He wishes to force Deidre to relinquish her claim to the estate and titles she recently inherited from their father.
Geralt first encounters him at the Camp, presumably next to his lean-to, though from the looks of it, he prefers quite spartan accommodations. Sabrina's tent is luxurious beyond compare, not even considering the illusions she employs inside. Later, he can be found just west of Sabrina's tent, near the first of the mercenary campfires.
According to Merton Bringgs, the prince is in charge of the expedition in name only, while the sorceress is the one actually running things on a day-to-day basis.
"If Witchers decide to interneve:"To negotiate with Sabrina and Merwin, witchers went to the mercenary camp. Though the hostility between two woman was too high, thus resulting in a conflict. With all mercenaries slain, Merwin and Sabrina ran to the latter's tent."If Geralt orders Sabrina to leave:" With Sabrina not holding the ropes anymore, Merwin and Deidre set aside differences and ruled Caingorn together. "If Geralt orders Deidre to let down her sword:" Geralt engages in a fight with Deidre, thus killing her and ending this long lasting conflict. Merwin couldn't rule Caingorn well enough and Caingorn became completely dependent to the Kaedwen.
 "Prince Merwin Ademeyn is a royal courtier and resides in Aard Carraigh. He has pursued his sister Deidre all the way to Kaer Morhen, considering her a dangerous mutant affected by the Curse of the Black Sun. He wishes to force Deidre to relinquish her claim to the estate and titles she inherited from their father. Ademeyn worships the deity Kreve and is considered a pious man. He is also a famous hunter, sharing this passion with Sabrina Glevissig. This may be why the nobleman and the sorceress understand each other so well."

Henselt was the king of Kaedwen, formally styled as His Majesty Henselt, King of Kaedwen, heir to the Dynasty of the Unicorn, Lord of Ard Carraigh, Archduke of Ban Ard, and vanquisher of Nilfgaard. For many years, he engaged in an ongoing dispute with King Demavend III of Aedirn over the Lormark. Henselt was also the architect of a plan to exterminate all nonhumans in areas bound by the Pontar, Gwenllech, and Buina rivers. He sported a classic beard and had small, penetrating eyes.
He was advised by Commissar Vilfrid Wenck, as well as the sorceress Sabrina Glevissig.
Biography.
Early life.
He married a woman whose name is not known and she bore him one son who had married before ultimately dying in a hunting accident.
Northern Wars.
In 1263, after hearing news of the Slaughter of Cintra, Henselt sent the Kaedwenian Army to Upper Sodden, and they fought and defeated the invading Nilfgaardian Empire. Over the next few years, after losing many soldiers in the Battle of Sodden Hill, Kaedwen was left undefended to the Scoia'tael, a problem which irritated Henselt greatly. In response, he put a lot of time and money into creating several armed forces to deal with the nonhuman threat, who chased them for years throughout the forests, to face execution publicly if caught.
In early 1267, he was summoned to Hagge by Demavend, along with the other leaders of the Northern Kingdoms, Meve of Lyria and Rivia, Foltest of Temeria and Vizimir II of Redania. He told them of the troubles of the Scoia'tael and how they should clear their forests of the nonhumans. He knew the risk of an attack against Nilfgaard, but eventually conceded with the other rulers that action had to be taken. When the topic of Ciri came up, Henselt realized if Emhyr var Emreis were to marry her, they would lose control of Cintra to the power of her royal blood. Eventually the rulers decided that if Cintra were to be kept under northern control, the young girl had to die.
By July, after the beginning of the Second Northern War and fall of several major northern kingdoms including Aedirn, Henselt signed a peace treaty with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. Aedirn was to be divided into two: the lands known as the Lormark in the north was to be occupied by Kaedwen, and Lower Aedirn by the Imperials. Henselt then offered support to Francesca Findabair, the newly appointed queen of Dol Blathanna, on the promise she would stop aiding the Scoia'tael.
"If Geralt allowed Roche to kill Henselt:" Seeking revenge for his men's deaths at the hand on Henselt, Vernon Roche personally killed the king. This resulted in a weakened Kaedwen that was no match for Radovid's invasion. With no heir or strong leadership left, the kingdom ended up surrendering and submitting to Redania after a few skirmishes.
"If Geralt chose to spare King Henselt in Roche's path or he chose Iorveth's path:" King Radovid invaded Kaedwen and King Henselt was killed during combat, weakening the kingdom and forcing it to submit to Redania.
Personality.
King Henselt stumbled ungainly on the dance floor and tripped over his tongue at courtly salons. On the battlefield, however, he moved as deftly as a fish in water. He knew all his infantryman by name and could recite the range of each and every catapult to the inch. Indeed, he adored his war machines. He would walk the ranks of his catapults like a proud father, tenderly stroking each ballista and trebuchet. He kept dozens and dozens of these contraptions in reserve - and built more any chance he got.
Henselt would often say two heads are better than one, and three - even better still. Thus he'd always order his troops to march into battle in threes, trios of soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder. His generals were skeptical of his strategy... but changed their minds when they saw the results.
"The Price of Neutrality" premium module.
In "The Price of Neutrality" premium module, King Henselt does not actually appear. He is referred to numerous times, most notably because of a rather badly spelled letter of safe conduct he has allegedly given to Merwin Ademeyn and his retinue.
Henselt is the king of Kaedwen at the time of this particular story. The sorceress, Sabrina Glevissig and Merwin both sit on his council. According to Merton Bringgs, the sorceress wields an unusually strong influence of the king and therefore the whole council. He says that she has been known to pound her fist on the council table and actually tell the king himself to be quiet, and apparently the king has obliged.
It is apparently under the king's auspices that the "search" for Deidre has been organized. Merwin is the official leader of the expedition, but it becomes clear quite early in the story that the true leader is Sabrina.
Journal entry.
"Known to be excessively greedy and hot-headed, Henselt is the king of Kaedwen, a powerful and expansive land in the North. He in no way resembles the classic image of a king. He is bearded as a robber and has small, penetrating, wandering eyes. Henselt feuds with his neighbors over borders, titles and protectorates. He is also known for his intense hatred of nonhumans."
Henselt, King of Kaedwen, heir to the Dynasty of the Unicorn, Lord of Ard Carraigh, Archduke of Ban Ard and vanquisher of Nilfgaard, makes his first appearance in the game at the beginning of Chapter II when Prince Stennis and Saskia confront him and demand that he withdraw his forces from Aedirn.
Henselt is advised by the sorcerer Dethmold, and is heavily influenced by him. Henselt is seen as an arrogant person and completely amoral. This, paired with his sense of royal immunity make him an unpopular king to some, especially among a number of his own nobility.
Despite this Henselt has managed to strengthen Kaedwen as a state and improved the lives of thousands of his people. His lack of heir however would result in a civil war for his country should he die.
"The witcher once said that in his life he had met thieves who resembled city councilors, councilors who were like begging louts, harlots who behaved like princesses, princesses who smelled like pregnant cows and kings who looked like thieves. King Henselt did not look exactly like a thief, but, with all due respect, he was not far off. He owed this resemblance only partly to his bearded countenance, beady eyes and wandering, yet penetrating gaze. His annexation of Lormark, called Upper Aedirn by its natives, at a time when Aedirn was fighting off the Nilfgaardian hoard at its southern border, was also considered a theft. The now dead King Demavend judged this deed severely and communicated this in curt yet resonant words. Yet that was not the sole reason for King Henselt's reputation as an unpleasant person, much bolstered by the monarch's ambitions and quarrels with his neighbors, and by his ruthless policies towards nonhumans, whom he persecuted with a passion, squandering his realm's strength and funds."
"The aging Henselt did not have a living heir, and the rumor was that he had found producing another son somewhat troublesome."
"Henselt's virility may have lessened with age, but his ambition certainly had not. The king wanted to wage a war and reclaim Lormark, a province he had already given up once, no matter the cost."
If Geralt chooses Roche's path during the end of Chapter I:
"The king reaped that which his deeds had sown years earlier, when he and Nilfgaard jointly partitioned Aedirn. Though he returned the stolen lands, there were many among the Kaedweni who considered Henselt's assault on an ally to have been dishonorable. These men created a conspiracy against their corrupt ruler, adding a new cause for concern to his pile of worries."
"Kaedwen's king had been terribly cursed by the sorceress Sabrina Glevissig, whom he had condemned to death."
"Thanks to the witcher, the curse plaguing Henselt was lifted. The king breathed a sigh of relief and returned to realizing his plans with redoubled energy. Apart from invading Aedirn, these probably included killing Stennis, hanging all nonhumans and ploughing Saskia, not necessarily in that order."
"Henselt revealed the entirety of his rotten character when he had Roche's men murdered and personally defiled Ves. In this way he gained a mortal enemy in the form of Vernon Roche."
"The king of Kaedwen satiated his ambitions. He led a victorious assault on Vergen and strengthened his kingdom."
If Geralt chooses to let Roche kill Henselt in Chapter II:
"Henselt made a mistake in underestimating the determination of the Blue Stripes' captain to avenge his men. Thus ended the line of Kaedweni rulers bearing the Unicorn on their seal."
If Geralt chooses to stop Roche from killing Henselt in chapter II:
"Henselt should consider himself lucky that Geralt was content with simply bruising his grizzled face, for Vernon would not have treated him as leniently. Thus grew the debt of gratitude which Henselt owed the witcher, though I don't think the Kaedweni ruler saw it that way."
If Geralt chooses Iorveth's path during the end of Chapter I:
"Henselt accepted the unthinkable. He shed some of his royal blood for a stranger – anything was acceptable if it furthered the pursuit of his longed-desired war."
"The ruler could not have felt worse if he had been kicked in the crotch. Defeated by the Vergenian irregulars, comprising peasants, local gentry, dwarves and elves and led by a female, he was forced to renounce his territorial claims to Aedirn and to officially confirm this at the Loc Muinne summit. I will remember the look on his grizzled mug for the rest of my life."
If Geralt chooses to rescue Triss in Chapter III:
"Henselt eagerly engaged in another partition – Kaedwen and Redania divided their weakened neighbor, the chaos-riddled Temeria."
If Geralt chooses to rescue Anaïs La Valette in Chapter III:
"Despite his appetite for new land, Henselt was forced to do without. The chance to snatch a part of Temeria passed right under his nose."
Journal entry.
Henselt is a leader in the Homecoming version.
"Scroll 1: King Henselt did not inspire awe with his bandit-like countenance. He did not dazzle ballroom crowds with charisma. He did not impress courtiers with refinement... Yet on the battlefield, one could see a master at work."
"Scroll 2: Henselt was capable of determining a catapult's range down to an inch. He walked amongst his siege machines not unlike a proud father – affectionately patting the stones, plucking at the taut ropes as would a troubador with his harp..."
"Scroll 3: Worse was when his attention shifted away from matters of war, for Henselt preferred the company of his siege machines to that of man. He was quick to anger... But not quick to calm."
"Scroll 4: As a result, despite his undisputed talent on the battlefield, Kaedwen's power did not grow under Henselt's leadership. He failed to gain allies and turn his military victories into lasting successes. Though this did not bother the king, as he waged war for its own sake."
"Chest 1: Fate has a twisted sense of humor and Henselt was one of its many victims. The King of Kaedwen often enjoyed boasting of his virility. Following several mugs of stout, he once proudly whispered to a confidant that he had fathered enough bastard children to fill all the thrones of the North – perhaps even several Nilfgaardian provinces. However, after his only legitimate heir died on a hunting expedition, the king failed to beget another successor to the throne – despite his many attempts. Some say it was Henselt's failures in the royal bedchambers that contributed to his explosive temperament..."
"Chest 2: Henselt did not have kingly countenance. Beady, wandering eyes. A bulbous, red nose. A large, bushy beard... Such a description better suits a bandit than one of the North's most prominent monarchs. Aware of less-than-noble visage, Henselt carefully curated his grand and stately attire, always taking care to bear the royal insignia. He wore an immense belt adorned with silver towers, a fifteen-ounce chain of solid gold, a crown topped with the royal unicorn, and a crimson kaftan exquisitely trimmed with weasel fur. But, as King Foltest used to say with a smile on his face, "A hog festooned with gold remains a hog all the same.""
"Chest 3: Henselt long refused to accept mages and sorceresses into his court. Though, in the end, he eventually included Sabrina Glevissig among his advisors, albeit not as a source of advice, but as yet another symbol of power – much like an ermine coat or golden scepter. Her role in the Kaedweni court was of the cosmetic variety. However, Sabrina refused to stay silent – sometimes silencing her king with a shout or by pounding her fists on the table. In time, she earned Henselt's recognition, but never forgot about the insults and disdain that first greeted her. Years later, when the opportunity struck, Sabrina betrayed the king... An offense for which she paid the ultimate price."

Caingorn is part of the Hengfors League and is its ruler member, located west of the Kestrel Mountains. The Braa river forms a natural border with Malleore.
History.
Settlement.
Caingorn was first settled by the Dauk and Wozgor people before the First Landing in the 760s, according to a classification by the historian Arnelius Grock.
Formation of the League.
The kingdom was part of the East March in Kovir, but later became allied with Creyden and Malleore, forming the League. After the First Treaty of Lan Exeter, Benda of Kaedwen was allowed to use, in official documents, the title of sovereign of Caingorn and Malleore.
Niedamir's reign.
Caingorn was ruled by King Niedamir during the Northern Wars.
Some time before 1271, King Henselt of Kaedwen reportedly looted the country, killing around ten thousand soldiers and civilians, but Niedamir and the League apparently survived and remained important players in the region.
Distant future.
In the far future, the weather changed enough that northern regions, like Talgar, Caingorn, and Kaedwen, were no longer able to grow certain types of produce due to the colder climate.
National emblems.
The coat of arms of Caingorn originally depicted a silver griffin on red. During Niedamir's rule, the color used was purpure. His archers wore purpure and gold.

"The Price of Neutrality" premium module.
In the module, the main character, Deidre Ademeyn hails from Caingorn. She is also the heiress apparent for the recently deceased ruler. Currently, her brother Merwin and the sorceress, Sabrina Glevissig, both sit on King Henselt's council which oversees Caingorn.
"Caingorn lies west of the Kestrel Mountains and has a silver griffon on a red field as its emblem. The kingdom has allied with Creyden and Malleore, forming the Hengfors League."
"The laws of Caingorn allow for female succession. The eldest children, be they men or women, inherit aristocratic titles and estates. Some nobly born younger sons fixate on the laws of neighboring lands and attempt to subvert this principle, but the law is the law and determines the factual state of things."

The camp, located in Kaer Morhen valley, is where Geralt first meets Merwin Ademeyn and Sabrina Glevissig in "The Price of Neutrality" premium module. The camp itself includes Merwin's lean-to, Sabrina's much more luxurious tent and two smaller areas where the mercenaries have set up their accommodations. It is also surrounded by packs of particularly vicious wolves.
"The nobly born Merwin Ademeyn and his entourage have made camp by the river ford near Kaer Morhen. The sorceress Sabrina Glevissig is ostensibly a member of the retinue, but her tent, located at the center of the camp alongside the aristocrat's, suggests an altogether different status. The camp is also home to mercenaries whose services Ademeyn retains for this mission. They sleep out in the open by campfires, taking turns guarding the campsite and the boats in which they traveled to the witchers' fortress. Thus far, Ademeyn and his group have endured several attacks by aggressive wolf packs that have infested the area."

Vivisection

Vivisection seems to be a commonly used method of investigating poorly understood creatures.
"Vivisection is the act of operating on a living organism. Mages perform vivisections on monsters and animals in an effort to expand their knowledge of anatomy. The subject must always be strongly fastened to the operating table as anesthesia is not generally used during the procedure."
"Those who examine young women who might have been affected by the Curse of the Black Sun often employ vivisection. It is the only procedure that allows one to determine with certainty if someone is a mutant and thus may be a dangerous beast."

Kaer Morhen valley

Kaer Morhen valley is an abandoned area of the mountainous region known as Hertch in northeastern Kaedwen, where the prehistoric sea was located many millennia ago. 
Currently, the only known "inhabited" structure in the valley is the limestone keep of Kaer Morhen, the home of the witcher's School of the Wolf, and surrounding places. The Gwenllech river flows through the valley.
"The Witcher".
Kaer Morhen valley is the area immediately adjacent to and surrounding the fortress of Kaer Morhen. It is here that the campsite of the unexpected visitors to Kaer Morhen is situated in "The Price of Neutrality" premium module. The valley itself is divided by a fast flowing river which can only be crossed at either of the two fords. The area is also infested with archespores, wolves, basilisks, giant centipedes and wyverns.
The area also boasts:
Herbs.
One can also "see" Beggartick outside, but it can not be picked. There is some that is "pickable" inside Sabrina's tent, but Geralt does not have the journal entry, so trying to pick it is useless.
There are also Berbercane trees here and there, but those, like the beggarticks, are just landscaping, too.
The valley of Kaer Morhen is a major region in the third and possibly final game of Geralt's adventures. The geography of the area, while more fully fleshed-out, is faithful to the original game, including the interior of the keep, which has preserved the same floorplan.
"Kaer Morhen, meaning "Keep of the Sea of Yore," is home to a school of witchers. Years ago the keep was destroyed and its inhabitants murdered during a massive pogrom. Currently only a handful of witchers winter here before setting out again on the Path."

Old mine outside Kaer Morhen

The old mine is situated in Kaer Morhen valley. It is where Geralt must go to find Eskel in "The Price of Neutrality" premium module to discuss Eskel's Unexpected Child, Deidre. The place is home to a kikimore hatchery and is infested with newly hatched (and hatching!) kikimores. It is also home to one or more basilisks, depending which entrance you choose.
The way there is also fraught with echinopsae, if the wolves do not get you first.
"The mine near Kaer Morhen is at least as old as the fortress. Once a rich source of iron ore, it is now deserted, mining having ceased long ago. Its abandoned tunnels have fallen into ruin, and the witchers venture there solely to gather sewant mushrooms. When the witchers return from their Paths each autumn, they must exterminate the monsters that make their lair in the mine while the beast-slayers are away."

Lilit, or Lilith, is a goddess or demon still worshiped in the East under the name Niya. While revered by Easterners, Nordlings believe that she will return someday and bring ruin to the world.
The sorcerer Eltibald, believed by some to be a prophet and by others to be a madman, claimed to have deciphered the ancient Dauk, Wozgor, and werebbubb legends, which connected the return of Lilit with the eclipse known as the Black Sun. Her path was to be prepared by "sixty women wearing gold crowns, who would fill the river valleys with blood", which he interpreted as girls of royal families born during or after the eclipse.
History.
While it is theorised that the cult of Lilit was started by nonhumans, its beginnings are lost to the history. The eldest people known to worship her were the Wozgor, primitive tribes inhabiting regions of modern-day Mag Turga, Geso, Kovir and Poviss, and Hengfors League. According to the tales, they used to offer their goddess blood sacrifices. When Nordling kings started establishing their realms, most of the Wozgor were either killed or forced to escape East, to which they brought the cult.
The remaining Wozgor mixed with eastern populations and the cult of Lilit transformed into a syncretic religion of Lilit-Niya. It gained popularity in certain regions of Hakland but the true centre was established in Zerrikania where its matriarchal character swayed many women across the country and the elites, endangering the state religion of divine dragons. In the west it became known mostly from old legends and relations of merchants from the east. Often exaggerated, those tales portrayed Niya as a demonic entity posing a threat to the world so the Eltibald's prophecy fell on a fertile ground to provoke anti-Lilit sentiments.
After the Northern Wars, Lilit-Niya started to gain some followers in the Northern Kingdoms and Nilfgaardian Empire. Partially comprised of men who believed that bowing before the cruel goddess would ensure their safety during the prophesied apocalypse, partially of women and children who were hurt by the horrors of war, the cult was growing quickly, eventually becoming a local opposition to the Church of the Great Sun in certain regions of the Empire.
Beliefs.
The cult of Lilit took different forms depending on the culture of the people who worshiped her. For the Wozgor, she was the goddess of war who rewarded spilling blood in her name. This eventually led to her introduction as a satanic figure in werebbubb mythology, in which she is interpreted as a bloodthirsty dragon, hungry for sheep and whose arrival is heralded by solar eclipses. One of the legendary werebbubb heroes, Dezeh, reportedly drove her off by shouting war cries very loudly and swinging his weapon at the dragon.
In the East, the cult has become more civilized. Niya, while still hungry for blood, provides a shelter for women and their children from the abuses of adult men. They believe she has avatars in lamias and succubi who seduce lustful men and lead to their oblivion. Easterner men in turn perceive her as a patron of erotic dreams and passions, but also a bringer of their impotence and fears.
Symbols.
The primary and most popular symbol of the religion is the Black Sun, though using it in Nilfgaard is considered as a blasphemy towards the Great Sun. Another emblem, used in Hakland, is a crossed circle. Animals attributed to Lilit by her followers are the owl, jackal, snake and ostrich. The jackal is also considered as a bad omen.
Cult.
The cult is most popular in Zerrikania and has significant groups of followers in Hakland. Her temples are located underground to avoid the sunlight. In the cellars, priestesses keep lamias whom they give offerings, sometimes of human males. Men are dissallowed to enter the sacred parts of the temples in any other character than an offering – each other case is considered profane. Apart from the temples, the followers esteem various ruins as places of the goddess' rest and tend to leave there minor gifts for her.
Lilit's holidays are the new moon (Black Moon's Nights) and solar and lunar eclipses. The solar eclipses are considered special and it is reported that some temples organize orgies connected with human (male) sacrifices.

Temple of Melitele (Ellander)

The Temple of Melitele in Ellander, just outside the main city, is quite possibly the best known place set up in the goddess' name. A poplar-flanked road leads from the gate to the buildings near the sanctuary and the main temple block which is built against a mountain wall. There are gardens and outbuildings, and the grotto, sort of a greenhouse hewn from rock and roofed over with crystal.
In the 13th century, Nenneke ran the temple, honoring the policies of Duke Hereward when it suited her fancy, tending to the wounded and the sick, helping with childbirth and training new priestesses of Melitele. It was here the Ciri began her instruction under the watchful eye of the priestess. Later, her studies were overseen by Yennefer.

Merton Bringgs

Merton Bringgs leads the band of mercenaries hired by Merwin and Sabrina to find Deidre. He is a reasonable individual but also fiercely principled. If the situation calls for it, he would not hesitate to carry out his orders, even if that means crossing blades with a witcher, after all, contracts are sacred! He is also a dwarf.
He and his band can be found around the campfire just west of the Camp. He is not adverse to a good game of dice, either.
"If Witchers choose to intervene:" To agree in terms with Sabrina and Merwin, Witchers went to the camp. A fight broke out and Merton Bringgs was among the slain.
 "Merton Bringgs is a dwarf who leads the mercenary unit providing security for Merwin Ademeyn and Sabrina Glevissig. He calls himself a rationalist and this seems true enough. Bringgs comes across as a thoroughly loyal and honest soldierly servant."
 "Bringgs' subordinates are paid regularly and at the agreed rate. Having no doubts as to their loyalty, if need be the dwarf will not hesitate to send them into battle against Deidre or even the witchers."

That is the only time Geralt passes through that gate, albeit involuntarily. Once inside the city, and free from his unexpected stay in the dungeon, Geralt can no longer pass through this gate (nor in fact any other gate except the one to the Dike) to leave the city of Vizima.

Hereward was the duke/prince of Ellander and a member of King Foltest of Temeria's Royal Council. He was married to Ermellia and known for his connivance towards the Order of the White Rose, especially Arthur Tailles.
Biography.
In 1252, after investing a large sum of money into the Order, which led to him receiving several of the knights into his service, he sent Falwick and Tailles to arrest Geralt of Rivia at the nearby Temple of Melitele. He wished the witcher out of the duchy as he didn't want a man with such a reputation living in his city.
Northern Wars.
In July 1267, after receiving an envoy from Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, Foltest held a council meeting to discuss Nilfgaard's advances in the Second Northern War, including details of the fall of Aedirn, and Verden's new sworn loyalty to Emhyr. Duke Bronibor believed hanging the envoy and a full frontal assault on the Imperials at Aedirn, with support from Kaedwen and Redania would force them back beyond the Marnadal Stairs, though Archpriest Willemer disagreed with his threats against the envoy, and Hereward also believed they should hear him out. Afterwards, Foltest announced to them he had accepted the envoys proposition of peace.
It is unknown whether he had any children, but by 1272, he was already succeeded by his relative Herevard II, the rightful heir.

Dennis Cranmer was the dwarven captain of Duke Hereward's guards. He was stocky, with flaxen hair and beard and steel-grey eyes. He was depicted as a very fair and impartial individual, if fervently dedicated to fulfilling his duties "to the letter".
Biography.
Dennis Cranmer once accompanied Arthur Tailles and Falwick when they confronted Geralt of Rivia and Dandelion in the city of Ellander. Falwick and Geralt agreed on a duel between the witcher and Tailles, and a rule was made, if Geralt's sword touched the young knight, the witcher would be dragged in front of Hereward.
Dennis stayed for the fight watching Geralt best Tailles, and grew admiration for him, with the two parting on good terms.
He later joined the Temerian Army as a volunteer, taking part in massive battles like Mayena and Brenna.

Idi was briefly the king of Kovir after wrestling the crown from Baldwin Thyssen, forcing the Thyssens to flee their ancestral homeland. During his tenure Stregobor and Zavist were his advisors and, due to their opinion, Idi banished Geralt instead of rewarding him for the amphisbaena he'd slain. He was also known to possess a broken hourglass.
He was killed, along with Rhyd (the king of Poviss) and their entire families, during the "Night of Knives and Torches".

&lt;/infobox&gt;Bernika of Talgar was one of the girls allegedly born under the curse of the Black Sun. A prince helped her escape from the tower in which she had been imprisoned and she later came to rule Talgar (perhaps during the upheaval of the Secession of Poviss), though according to Stregobor, a believer in the curse, not very justly.
It was she who provided refuge to Esterad Thyssen of Kovir while in exile; Esterad's wife Zuleyka is likely a relative of her's.

Sylvans, called willowers or pucks, and labeled superstitiously as devils"' (archaic Common: "deovel"; Elder Speech: "d'yaebl"; Dwarvish: "duvvel"), are an exceptionally rare, intelligent race native to the woodlands of the Northern Kingdoms. They are distinguished by prominent goat-like visage and delight in pranks, feasting, and music.
Sporadically, sylvan may also be referred to as a "faun".
Characteristics.
Physical description.
Sylvans resemble a human with goat's horns, soft lips with yellow, horse-like teeth, and a goatee. Their lower body features a tasseled tail and hairy legs with cloven hooves. The horns earned sylvans the label of "devils", which they dislike, and occasionally cause confusion with the beastly chorts for humans who have never seen the latter. Their voice resembles goat's bleating. Their life-spans reached up to more than 100 years. 
Though miles away apart in behavior, sylvans are related to the Aen Seidhe with whom they share the blood of the Elder Race. It's therefore unsurprising that many sylvans are quite familiar with elven defenses and that the two peoples have no difficulty to cooperate. Some scholars include sylvans among the so-called sapient monsters.
Mental traits.
Most sylvans are merry, enjoying tricks and riddles more than anything else. They also love music and are quite apt at playing reed pipes. Mischief aside, they can be helpful by fertilizing fields, scaring birds away, voluntarily watching over turnips, and eating caterpillars. Their diet is largely herbivorous. However, they can also become very comfortable and spend days in idleness, puffing on pipes, overeating, and downing stiff drinks.
As for magical prowess, many sylvans can learn mental spells. Others, it seems, found a way to breathe fire in combat.
Procreation.
Dryads, with whom they live in Brokilon, value sylvans as lovers guaranteeing a vigorous daughter. In theory, sylvans may procreate with elves and humans but this doesn't occur. Indeed, fauns bedding nymphs are a popular motif in art and sculpture.

A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading The Heart of the Wilds, but the book never appears during gameplay.
"Sylvans are cruel, greedy and treacherous. Still, I prefer them to dh'oine.– Yaevinn, legendary Scoia'tael commander"
"Sylvans and yakshas, a kindred species, are extremely rare woodland creatures whose appearance combines traits of goats and rotund men. These beings usually pose little danger, for they limit their contact with humans to playing harmless (though often bothersome) tricks and eating crops from their fields."
Unobtainable without reading the book:
"Sylvans and yakshas, resemble men not just in appearance, but also in behavior – though it must be said they have adopted more of our vices and weaknesses than strengths. Lazy by nature, they would gladly spend every day in idleness, puffing on pipes, gorging on rich foods and downing strong drinks."
"Since sylvans and yakshas enjoy partaking of the fruits of others' labors without asking permission, men do not take to them kindly and at times, fooled by their awkward appearance, will try to solve this problem using force. This often ends in tragedy, for sylvans, despite their corpulent frames, are astonishingly strong and agile. They also emit a powerful and extremely unpleasant scent which can cause even a witcher, whose line of work accustoms him to foul stenches, to gag and feel faint. Watch out in particular for yakshas, which are fiercer and keener on fighting than normal sylvan."
Combat tactics.
Melee combat against a sylvan is difficult, even for a witcher. One has to evade the physical strikes from a sylvan, not attempt to parry or counterattack. Yrden can gain time to bring a silver sword into play, but a sylvan can counter this by breathing intense flames that melt through the best armor. If close-quarters combat isn't going well, one should be prepared to make use of long-ranged options. A crossbow loaded with good bolts can keep the witcher relatively safe, whilst being effective.
There are four types of the monster in the game: Sylvan, Sylvan Dearg, Harrower, and Mulcher. They differ with strength level and appearance. Sylvan drops powdered monster tissue, while the other 3 drop relict remains. They are all vulnerable to strong attacks and steel.
Sylvan.
It is a mid level common monster, and it is virtually the same as its " counterpart, when it comes to appearance.
Sylvan Dearg.
It is a rare monster, slightly stronger than a common Sylvan.
Harrower and Mulcher.
They are both legendary monsters, appearing only during Lammas. According to the bestiary, Harrower is said to deliver exteremly strong blows and Mulcher is know to scatter bones around fields.

Ethain, son of Mathen, was the king of Cidaris.
Biography.
Kraken affair.
One summer, a huge number of ships sailing into the city of Cidaris began to sink because of kraken attacks. Soon after the kraken's first appearance, an odd boat with an equally strange girl named Sha was found ashore. King Mathen, Ethain's father, believed she must have been sent by the kraken and that the attacks would cease if Prince Ethain married her. To entertain guests at pre-wedding feasts, Mathen invited three famed poets: Dandelion, Valdo Marx, and Ellen Daven.
Later, during the wedding reception, a servant rushed into the throne room and informed that the kraken had attacked again, this time destroying an entire fleet. Enraged, Mathen accused Sha of lying and ordered her thrown into a palace dungeon. When Ellen and Dandelion defended her, he ordered them jailed as well. Feeling deceived, Mathen then sentenced Sha to be fed to the kraken the next morning.
Numerous people gathered on the shore as soon as the sun appeared on the horizon. A couple of men started to push a boat with tied Sha out to the sea but were stopped by Prince Ethain in full armor. Even though he didn't love her, he felt obliged to protect her from horrific death. King Mathen ordered him to go back to the palace immediately and during their dialogue the kraken appeared again causing tremor. Ethain went straight to the abandoned boat and started untying his wife. Mathen ordered guards to stop him and about a half of them rushed to do so while the other half sided with the Prince. The King encircled them and stabbed one of Ethain's defenders, Cavox, in the back. The guard managed to turn and stroke him.
Meanwhile Ethain freed Sha and she hugged him crying. She touched his cheek, gazed upon his eyes and jumped straight into the ocean, causing kraken and waves to disappear.
Mathen didn't survive the injuries and died in his son's arms. Few days later, Ethain was crowned.
First years on the throne.
Ethain eventually renovated the damages of the city and the fleet and trade flourished again. Unlike his father, Ethain became a sworn patron and connoisseur of art, especially the poetry. He befriended Dandelion, Valdo and Ellen, as well as the latter's sister Essi.
Around the 1250s the King managed to overcome the crisis with a warlord who had risen against him, with the help of King Foltest of Temeria. Later, at the late 1250s or early 1260s, he became a suzerain of Duke Agloval of Bremervoord, expanding the realm.
He sent mage Dorregaray of Vole as his representative and spy to attend the Thanedd meeting in 1267.
Northern War II.
Nilfgaardian Empire invaded the Northern Realms on July. The task of taking regions of Verden, Kerack and Cidaris was given to Joachim de Wett and his Verden Operations Group. When Ervyll surrendered and became an imperial vassal, the main aim of the attack was Ethain's domain. The King utilized guerilla tactics, coordinating his actions with Skelliger pirates and Verdenian rebels led by Kistrin. Their joint efforts proved successful and Joachim's progresses were minor or none.
Further reign.
After the war ended, Ethain was one of the negotiators of the peace treaty. He attended to a parade in Novigrad and the wedding of Cirilla Fiona with Emhyr var Emreis.
Personality.
He was perceived as a wise politician, just ruler and a good strategist, though some compared him to a pirate.
Ethain was interested in poetry since his youth. He used to express states of his mind via self-made metaphors, which were seen by Dandelion and Ellen as bit bloated. As a king, he warmly welcomed art and artists at his court, which became known as a centre of culture. He was a man of honour, rushing to help the people even when he did not love them.

Audoen was a self-appointed king of Hengfors and Arcsea. Originally managing Arcsea on behalf of his father, the governor under Kovirian sovereignty, he began a process which his son Niedamir concluded by creating the Hengfors League.
Biography.
Son of the governor.
Born into a line of Arcsean governors subject to the House of Thyssen, Audoen received responsibility for the region from his father while still young. As King Baldwin Thyssen faced a massive power struggle in the 1230s, Audoen seized the opportunity and carved out a realm for himself, declaring the marshlands of Arcsea independent from Kovir and Poviss. 
In fact, Audoen was just in the Blaviken region when the news reached him, hunting pirates alongside the troops given by local petty nobility and Alan Korber, the castellan of Sturefors. Hearing about the death of Hengfors' margrave, the assembled knights swore allegiance to Audoen who set forth to annex Hengfors. When the city saw the approaching army, its meager garrison outright refused to obey the councilors and opened the gates.
King in Hengfors.
Now a king, Audoen spent the following years tediously strengthening his post. Hengfors' markets ran red with the blood of his father's killers. Castellan Alan of Sturefors got promoted to count and granted an estate in the capital for his help. The pirates plaguing Arcsea and the Braa estuary were routed at last. Confident Idi of Kovir could not invade, Audoen reached for the crown–which the archpriest of Kreve put on his head gratefully due to Audoen's generous funding of a cathedral in Hengfors.
The king recognized the merit of having two chivalric orders, the Knights of the Rose and the Knights of the Stirrup, roaming his domains and thus endorsed their actions while ensuring that neither of the two would overpower him.
But not all went splendidly. Intending to add Creyden, he accepted Princess Renfri, deprived of her inheritance, as a vassal. As such, he gave her a letter of safe conduct bearing his seal which asserted that she acted with royal blessing–even if the word "maltreat" got misspelled as "maltreet". Alas, she died by the sword of witcher Geralt of Rivia during the infamous butchering in Blaviken. His idea to reach for Yamurlak upon King Abrad's death failed as well because Radovid IV, whose army was greater and whose dynasty had closer claim, outrun him. The king, however, hadn't lost heart. After all, both Crinfrid and the princes of Malleore accepted his protectorate.
His campaign to rule over Caingorn flourished into success during the 1240s, ending the era of the House of Ademeyn and the kingdom's dependance on Kaedwen. As it turned out, Audoen wouldn't see more conquests. Near Vattweir, his troops got crushed by Henselt's many times larger military. When the remnants of Hengfors' army fled through the Kestrel Mountains, stones fell from under the king's horse and he died before the guards could reach the bottom of the ravine.
Legacy.
Upon Audoen's death, his son Niedamir inherited Caingorn while King Vizimir II incorporated Arcsea into Redania.
Appearance and personality.
As a king, Audoen was very concerned with his authority. If someone disobeyed him or went against a decree, flaying and hanging were two options they could count on.

Herbert Stammelford was a mage and founding member of the Chapter of the Gift and the Art. He was also the author of "Dialogues on the Nature of Magic".
Biography.
Early life.
In the late half of the 9th century, the first Chapter was installed and their magical laws enacted by Stammelford, Aurora Henson, Ivo Richert, Agnes of Glanville, Geoffrey Monck and Radmir of Tor Carnedd. Many mages did not conform to their laws, and so a bloody war broke out, Raffard the White being a casualty.
Stammelford once moved a mountain because it obstructed the view from his tower, having been able to do so because he commanded a d'ao, an earth genie.

The Blue or Grey Mountains are a large mountain range dividing the Northern Kingdoms from Haakland and Zerrikania. The mountains form a natural border for at least Lyria, Aedirn, and Kaedwen. Dol Blathanna, the Valley of Flowers, lies at the very foot of the mountains, and the river Yaruga's spring is hidden among the rocky heights.
The free elves have made their abode in the mountains; amongst them were Ida Emean aep Sivney and Filavandrel aén Fidháil.
Emblems.
The coat of arms in the infobox is inspired by the flower shield in pre-Homecoming Gwent board and colors worn by the Blue Mountains commando.

A banshee, also called a beann'shie, is a female spirit who cries on Saovine night, wailing a warning of those who will die. Banshees are not specifically malicious spirits, though meeting one is considered to be an omen of the worst kind.
Their appearance varies, though most often they're pale, thin women wearing grey vestments, with burning red eyes.
"Beann'shies howl and shriek, and if you hear their cry, you can know you'll join the ranks of the dead that night.– beggar from Dun Dâre"
"Old gossips claim beann'shies are the spirits of women stuck between life and death due to traumatic experiences. Their wails and howls are considered ill omens of imminent, inevitable death, though they are said not to attack the living themselves. Most often they appear in the form of pale, tear-streaked women with shriveled faces and wrinkled, corpse-like bodies."
Unobtainable, only present in the game files:
"Beann'shies are wraiths which use their piercing cries to wake the dead to fight their foes. Their cries can additionally stun enemies, making them easy targets for direct attacks."
"Beann'shies can regenerate, but this does not mean they cannot be defeated – they are vulnerable to silver and wraith oil as well as the witcher Signs (though they are known to be resistant to the Signs' critical effects)."
"When fighting a beann'shie, there is no point using bombs or bolts, for they will do the wraith no damage.

Vypper, also known as Wipper, is a creature of the swamps, haunting them and fighting for territory with the kikimore.
Vyppers are large reptiles, like vipers the size of alligators. They can stretch their jaws wide, but the fangs are not as much of a threat as they look. It is their poison one should beware of.
In the leaked materials for the game, Wipper was put down as a possible monster, but was removed during development around 2013 - 2014.

They robbed merchants at first until one day when the gnomes began an argument amongst themselves so violent none of them made it out alive save for the princess. After that, Renfri put together a band of her own.

<doc id="5280" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5280" title="Brotherhood of Sorcerers">
Brotherhood of Sorcerers

The Brotherhood of Sorcerers was the oldest organization of mages in the Northern Kingdoms. Formed in the aftermath of the non-aggression pact established by the Novigradian Union in the 8th century, it united and had control over most of the magic users, magic academies like Aretuza or Ban Ard, and institutions, such as Rissberg. It was led by the Chapter of the Gift and the Art, which consisted of two main governing bodies that guided magical practice for centuries before dissolving completely as a consequence of the events that transpired during the Thanedd coup in 1267.
Governing bodies.
The most distinguished practitioners of magical art first founded the Council of Wizards to institute codified rules on the use of magic, but the creation of a new hierarchy of order sparked a brief civil war, costing the life of Raffard the White, who opposed its formation.
The Council was eventually split into two groups of 5 mages: the Chapter of the Gift and the Art and the Council of Wizards, with the Chapter having the highest hierarchy and the Council the lower, but the latter still wielded important authority in the Brotherhood. The Council was established to aid the Brotherhood in administering and regulating practitioners of magic. In particular, the Council focused on magical experiments, research, and expanding magical knowledge.
History.
Establishment.
Following the first landing of humans in the 760s, the Novigradian Union, consisting of the mages Jan Bekker, Giambattista and Geoffrey Monck, established the Brotherhood. They based their headquarters in the keep Mirthe, and trained Sources there, including the young Agnes of Glanville, the first female mage and member of the Brotherhood.
In the 9th century, the Chapter of the Gift and the Art was installed and the Brotherhood's laws enacted for all mages. Those who didn't conform ended up in a bloody war with the Chapter, Raffard the White being a casualty.
In the 10th and 11th century, after Monck established good relations with the elves, the Brotherhood started sending students to Loc Muinne to study under the Aen Saevherne. Several years later, because of this peace treaty, they objected to the first elven-human war and so no mage participated.
First Northern War.
In 1263, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, led by Vilgefortz, fought alongside the armies of the Northern Kingdoms in a massive battle against the Nilfgaardian Empire in Upper Sodden, known famously as the Battle of Sodden Hill. They fought bravely and ferociously, shedding blood for the defense of the north, until the Nilfgaardian Army was defeated.
Thanedd coup.
On the night of June 30th 1267, during one of the Brotherhood's Grand Mage's Conclaves on Thanedd Island, several northern supporting mages led by Philippa Eilhart arrested those suspected to be allied with Nilfgaard, including Vilgefortz, Artaud Terranova and Francesca Findabair. After beginning their trial in Garstang, Philippa and Tissaia de Vries got into an argument about the motives of the situation, which led to the latter suddenly removing the magic barrier around the island. This led to a slaughter between mages, Scoia'tael and Redanian soldiers, and the unofficial end of the Brotherhood.
Aftermath.
After the coup that essentially dissolved the Brotherhood, former Council member Philippa Eilhart established the Lodge of Sorceresses. Unlike the Brotherhood, the Lodge was female-only and included sorceresses from both the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire.
Prohibitions.
The Brotherhood regulated and oversaw the use of magic, making sure that practices such as demonology, necromancy, and Artefact compression (labeled "black magic") were kept to a bare minimum, and the practitioners of such magics were given fair and just sentences; these sentences usually being shackled in dimeritium for several centuries. Individuals who ignored the ban used to be excluded from the Brotherhood and were considered as renegades, e.g. Alzur or Idarran of Ulivo. However, though all mages are equal before the law, some of them are actually "more equal than others"; an open secret was commonly breaking the bans in Rissberg until it came to light after the deaths of Grandmaster Ortolan and his favorite Sorel Degerlund.

Oribasius Giafranco Paolo Reuven, better known as Ori Reuven, was the personal assistant of Sigismund Dijkstra, the head of the Redanian Secret Service, for 19 years. He had a master's degree in law and was credited with having "an infallible memory".
Biography.
Assistant to Dijkstra.
Ori Reuven began working as a personal assistant for the Redanian spymaster Dijkstra in 1249. His work consisted of being the spymaster's secretary, scribe, and confidant, often having to write letters directed to Philippa Eilhart, and helping with his vast historical knowledge and "infallible memory".
In July 1267, after Triss Merigold helped the wounded Geralt flee the Thanedd coup, he was instructed by Dijsktra to write to Philippa informing her of the witcher's safe arrival and healing in Brokilon, "Ciri"'s arrival in Nilfgaard, and finally of whether she believed Yennefer had allied with the Imperials. Ori then told the spymaster details of the dryad-allied woman Milva. A few weeks later, he sent another letter to Philippa on Dijkstra's behalf, explaining ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen had given Dijkstra notice the knight Cahir aep Ceallach was to be captured, despite the Vicovarian being under previous instructions from Emperor Emhyr to find Ciri.
In 1268, a plot to assassinate Dijkstra marked the end of his service, as the spymaster anticipated the murder attempt and exiled himself, leaving no trace behind. The mercenaries spared Ori's life, though some unspecified time later, Ori was incarcerated, interrogated, and tortured for six years. By the time he was released, all the fingers in his hands were broken, and he suffered from scurvy, anemia, glaucoma, and asthma. Less than a year later, he died in poverty in a temple hospice, forgotten. The manuscript he wrote while working for Dijkstra, "Shadow People, or the story of His Majesty's Secret Service", mysteriously disappeared.
"The Witcher".
In 1270, Geralt can meet a bootblack in the alley outside Detective Raymond's place in the Temple Quarter. He is a good source of general information, and Geralt quickly notices that he seems rather well-informed for a bootblack. When you challenge him on this, he clams up and will not speak to you again until you have left the area completely and come back.
If you have previously engaged in a drinking contest with Thaler, you have a seemingly useless book, Shadow People, or the story of His Majesty's Secret Service. If you speak to the bootblack a second time, you will notice that you now have the option to give him a gift. Give him the book.
At this point, he says "You know who I am... ahem, I thought that scroll had disappeared for good.", which confirms that he is in fact Ori Reuven. After a bit more conversation, he gives you the Prophet Lebioda's signet ring, which will help Geralt get past Grandma at Shani's place.

The City Guard of Vizima are the armed forces in charge of protecting the city and surrounding outskirts.
History.
In 1252, three members of the guard arrived to The Fox tavern upon hearing a fight, and found the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who was arrested and after using mind control to sway the guards, was led to Castellan Velerad.
Equipment.
Standard arms used by the guards include truncheons wound in leather straps and a sword. However, others are known to carry pikes and crossbows.
"The Witcher".
In "The Witcher", city guards are stationed at all gates and also roam the streets. They also help Geralt fight salamanders and other monsters if they happen to be nearby. Their default behavior is to help the witcher. They are based out of the city dungeon. The captain of the City Guard is Vincent Meis.
Unparalleled Backup.
Geralt "can" attack some members of the city guard, but only those who have a blue base (circle on the ground). Those with green bases can not be attacked.
If Geralt accidentally angers a city guard (with a blue base), say by attacking them, their attitude toward Geralt becomes hostile and their base and labels turn red as will those of any affiliated NPCs in the area. This means that the fight is on. Not all NPCs will suddenly attack, only those NPCs which can attack Geralt will do so, but commoners will simply cower in fear.
If Geralt kills one of the city guards, a warrant with royal gold will be sent. This action will summon a relentless headhunter (or more accurately, a relentless and unending series of headhunters). Geralt can choose to engage a headhunter in battle or pay 1000 . However, it is extremely difficult to kill a headhunter and since killing one only summons another, the best solution is to run away before killing any guards (eventually they do revert to their non-hostile state) or pay up.

Containers

In "The Witcher", Geralt must acquire many and he can not always afford to buy them from merchants. To this end, it is beneficial for him to enter all premises he can and rifle through any and all containers found therein for the supplies he needs.
In a sense, all creatures, human and otherwise are containers, as are many trees, shrubs and plants which bear the required for alchemical . They will not be dealt with individually in this section as they each have their own page anyway.
The easiest, and most reliable, way to find any containers in view is to hold down the &lt;samp&gt;Alt&lt;/samp&gt;-key. This highlights all the usable items in view, a great way to find remains after a large melee.

Yes, the remains that Geralt finds or produces are also containers with potentially useful or valuable items:

Salamandra hideout in the outskirts

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
The Salamandra hideout in the outskirts of Vizima is in one of the two most southerly abandoned huts, on the south road which leads to the Circle of the Windy Wanderer and the cave where Abigail makes her potentially last stand.
The house is locked until the Reverend reveals the location of the hideout to Geralt. The Reverend tells him that Innkeeper Olaf has a key, and indeed he does, but actually the key is not required to enter the hideout, only dispatching the two Salamandra lackeys who guard the place is necessary. However, it is clear that plot-wise, Geralt should go to the Inn first and rescue Shani and then take the key from Olaf's dead body.
Barghests have a tendency to show up around this house during the night, the Beast appears occasionally, as does a ghoul from time to time.

Girl

Girl is a character who appears only briefly in "The Price of Neutrality." She can be found with the cook near the campfire, north of the Camp, but initially will not speak to the witcher. Only after Geralt leaves the camp the first times does she take him aside to plead with him to kill Deidre, whom she considers a monster.
She then relates a story which tells of how she and her mother were forced by Deidre herself to watch as the princess and her armed band slowly and cruelly tortured her father to death.
Note.
Though this character is named "Girl", she is obviously an adult.

<doc id="5533" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5533" title="Roben">
Roben

Roben was the Kennel Master in Caingorn who trained its ruler's bear-hunting dogs and was at one point lover of Princess Deidre Ademeyn.
Biography.
Roben lived above the dogs' kennel and was also known to one Sabrina Glevissig. The rest of Roben's tale is less clear as there are conflicting accounts. For Deidre, Roben is intimately involved in the reason for her hatred of Sabrina. For Sabrina, he was a toy, enjoyed and then discarded.
The tales agree that "something" happened to Roben which caused him to acquire an intense fear of the very dogs he trained. They also agree that Roben was attacked by his dogs. The stories diverge as to what caused this change in Roben and also the exact sequence of events on the night he was attacked.
From Merwin Ademeyn, brother of Deidre, Geralt also heard a sad tale from Deidre's childhood. It seems that at the age of 12 she was raped by a charlatan claiming to be a oneiromancer, a type of mage-diviner of dreams. Her father, who had hired the mage never believed her claim which caused Deidre to flee assisted by "a young stable boy, an excessively broad-shouldered oaf". This could also have been Roben.

Once inside, Geralt must break down a few flimsy stone walls using Aard (the are truly flimsy looking, none of the more solid obstacles can be removed) and fight off around a dozen or so cultists to get to the booty. This booty is concentrated in two chests, and each chest is in a heavily guarded room.

The interior is quite spartan. On the main floor are his living quarters, complete with several containers full of good stuff, and a nicely potted wolf's aloe.

Kalkstein is also quite hospitable, allowing Geralt to stop and meditate there any time he is in residence.

There are many kinds of objects in the game and not all of them are décor only. Some objects are actually "usable". To locate all usable objects in view, simply hold down the Alt-key. This will cause object labels to appear on screen. Left-click on "usable" items to make use of them.
Tip: Press Alt to highlight all usable items in view. Items and doors can not be used during combat.
Item manipulation cursors.
This is the cursor presented when an item can be used or employed, usually (perhaps exclusively) a weapon.
This is the cursor presented when an item can be picked up and added to inventory, or used. It is used for opening containers, lighting campfires, picking herbs, ringing bells.
This is the cursor presented when an item can be picked up like dice in dice poker.
Herbalism.
Herbalism is fairly fundamental to gameplay. Even on the easiest level of gameplay, where no alchemy is required for combat, there is still a need to gather some , if for no other reason than to have Cat potions. This skill is acquired early in the game, either through the allocation of talents or when Geralt must find White myrtle for Abigail. She gives him that knowledge if he does not already have it.
If you do not have an entry in the Ingredients section of the Journal for a given herb or plant, then the caption above it will read "unknown herb" instead of the plant's true name.
Tip: You must have the herbalism skill in the Intelligence group to gather . You also need to have knowledge of a given plant, which you can find in . Herbs can also be purchased from herbalists and alchemists.
Skinning Monsters.
Skinning monsters, like herbalism, is fairly fundamental to gameplay. Even on the easiest level of gameplay, where no alchemy is required for combat, there is still a need to gather ingredients, if for no other reason than to have Cat potions. Monster carcasses are a rich source of ingredients, and so very plentiful, it would seem a shame to waste them. To extract alchemical components:
Tips
Attacking.
For more in-depth information on battle, see The Witcher combat or Combat Styles.
Attack cursors.
This cursor is presented when a hostile creature is clicked on. It initiates combat, and thereafter, continues combat, until either Geralt, or the enemy (or enemies) is dead.
This cursor is presented (if you are in easy, or intermediate mode) when you should click again during combat to chain attacks. In advanced mode, you only see a blue streak where your sword has just travelled and hear a faint "whoosing" sound to alert you to the timing of your attacks.
This cursor is presented when an NPC is ready to fistfight, it functions like the attack cursor.
Floating Messages.
Default game behaviour is to alert you to what is going on, particularly in battle, but sometimes this can become too much for some more experienced players. These "floating messages", like 'Too Fast!' and 'Final Attack!', can be turned off in the game options.

The Witcher character interaction

Character interaction happens primarily through dialogue in "The Witcher". One could, of course argue that swordplay is also character interaction, but for the purposes of this article, we will limit the discussion to peaceful, at least initially, interactions. Below is a list, with icons, of the kinds of character interaction that can be initiated by speaking with game characters, or NPCs. This is how Geralt interacts with the various game characters he meets along his Path.
 
Bribe.
Occasionally, it becomes obvious that a few orens would ease things along. When such an opportunity presents itself,
Tip: Characters respond differently to bribes and some might take offence if your bribe is too modest.
Drink.
Drinking contests are a concept that I think is unique to this game, but I could be wrong. They can be quite amusing, but they can also bring rewards in the form of valuable items, or information. So indulge!
Fight.
Fistfights are not just an option to win some extra orens and fame, they are also a quest in the game. They mostly happen in inns and taverns, but can crop up anywhere a misunderstanding can happen.
For casual fistfights to earn a few extra orens:
Note: Fistfighters will not accept bets that are over double of the initial bet. (E.g.: Initial bet is 20 . The fistfighter will not accept a bet over 40 .)
For quests and misunderstandings ("i.e." where no wager is in question):
Forge.
The weapons that Geralt begins the game with are adequate, but not great. As he swashes and buckles his way through Vizima and environs, he finds runes and pieces of meteorite ore. These can be brought to a blacksmith to be used to either imbue his silver sword with magical abilities, in the case of runes, or have a new steel sword with magical properties forged, in the case of meteorite ore.
Note: The forge icon also allows you to "buy and sell" items in addition to the blade enhancement service.
Gifts.
There are several reasons to give gifts in the game: for information, in exchange for some other more desirable item, for a service, or just to be nice. To give a gift:
Tip: Win the favor of other characters by giving them gifts.
Meditation and Storage.
These activities often, but not always, happen in the same place, inns and taverns, in the game. There are also lots of places that Geralt can meditate for free, like campfires and friends' places.
Meditation:
Storage:
Pay.
This icon is used to pay a sum of money in a "legal" exchange, as opposed to a bribery situation. Typically this is for a service. The Ferryman wants 5 to cross to or from the swamp. This is the icon that is used to effect that transaction.
Play Dice.
There are plenty of opportunities to play dice poker in the game. Whenever a game character plays poker, this icon appears in the conversation screen. Just click on it to play. There is also a perfectly good article devoted to the subject:
Signet Rings.
Signet rings are useful for gaining entry into some places, or just passage to others. When you are given such a ring,
When confronted with an opportunity to use a signet ring in the course of a conversation, and provided of course that you have the necessary ring,
Tip: Characters recognizing signets will be more favourably inclined. Presenting the wrong signet might offend a character.

The Witcher character statistics

Character statistics are the most important way to gauge the overall health of our hero. Whether Geralt lives or dies is governed by his Vitality, but 
Endurance and Toxicity play their parts.
Vitality.
Vitality (sometimes referred to as "hit points"), indicated by the red bar, drops as damage is incurred. If the red bar reaches zero, Geralt dies. A grey screen and (very) audible heart beats warn you of dangerously low vitality.
Vitality is restored over time, very slowly though. Recover more quickly by meditating, drinking potions or eating food.
Endurance.
Geralt's endurance, indicated by the yellow bar, drops each time he uses a sign. He can not cast signs when his endurance is too low.
In fistfights, blocking also siphons Geralt's endurance; reaching zero, Geralt can not block.
Endurance is restored over time. Use potions to help with its regeneration.
Toxicity.
Toxicity, indicated by the green bar, increases with each potion consumed. Excessive toxicity adversely affects Geralt's abilities and may even lead to his demise. When toxicity is reaching a dangerous level, "red sparkles" (blood) begin to appear in the field of view, like Geralt is beginning to hallucinate. This is generally a very good indication that it is time to detox.
When toxicity exceeds a certain threshold (around 60-70), Geralt will lose a sizeable portion of his vitality after drinking a potion. When toxicity nears 90, he will be unable to run. If toxicity ever reaches 100, Geralt will die on the spot.
Toxicity is reduced over time, very gradually though.

A Guide to Vizima is a book in "The Witcher".
A Guide to Vizima"Marco Knopf"
"Like most human cities, Vizima was built on the foundations of an elven city. The seat of the Temerian kings grew over the centuries and today consists of three large districts, a port and sprawling outskirts. In the Temple Quarter, the visitor's attention is drawn to the monumental Cloister of the Order of the Flaming Rose. Saint Lebioda's Hospital, famous for the many miraculous recoveries that have occurred there, is also hard to miss. While admiring these edifices, avoid wandering into the nonhuman district, which has become a den of poverty and the lair of social outcasts. Most nonhumans have been relocated to Old Vizima, which has become a ghetto inaccessible to visitors. Currently the Trade Quarter is developing rapidly. This is hardly surprising as it is home to wealthy merchants as well as trade and political officials. The city's leading bank and the town hall can also be found here. While in Vizima's Trade Quarter be sure to visit the famous marketplace, where traders offer goods from around the world."

Draconids is a diverse order of quasi-reptiles that often cause trouble to humanoid races.
Characteristics.
While the creature most commonly associated with draconids is dragon, the most populous members of this order are actually the so-called lesser draconids, which include dracolizards (slyzards), forktails and wyverns. They may be easily confused with dragons, as they share scaly skin or armor made up of bony plates, bat wings, and reptilian maws, legs, and tails. They are smaller and less intelligent than dragons, and often possess atrophied forelegs, to the point that certain species have none at all. Dragons, in turn, are larger, possess two pairs of well-developed legs, huge wings and tail, and obvious intelligence. However, mutations from this scheme exist.
A significant part of draconids possess no wings, such as dracoturtles or vigilosaurs. At least one species, sea serpent, has no limbs.
Draconids in culture.
The danger draconids present to herds and communities has led to conflicts with human and nonhuman races. Witchers and other specialized hunters such as Crinfrid Reavers hunt some or all of these creatures, even though the danger is not always lethal.
There are however notable exceptions. In Zerrikania, dragons are venerated and warrior orders such as "Faithel" have emerged in order to protect these sacred beings. Even in Northern Realms and Nilfgaardian Empire dragons are sometimes perceived as more than vile beasts, and are displayed on noble banners and coats of arms.
Draconids are sometimes bred as pets or for guarding purposes. An example is wyvern, bred by certain druid circles and crime bosses. Mages of Rissberg have even created entirely new species of draconids, such as vigilosaurs.
Draconids are a type of monster in ". Draconids include:

Baptism of Fire (Polish: "Chrzest ognia"), written by Andrzej Sapkowski, was first published in Poland in 1996 and is the fifth book in "The Witcher" series and the third novel in the saga, thus continuing the saga of Geralt and Ciri directly onwards from the end of "Time of Contempt".
The first UK edition was released on 6 March 2014 and the U.S. edition was released on 24 June 2014. Both were translated by David French and followed by "The Tower of the Swallow". The second UK edition was released the next year on 8 January 2015.
Motto.
The motto of the book is a quote from the song "Brothers in Arms":
"Through these fields of destruction"
"Baptisms of fire"
"I've witnessed your suffering"
"As the battle raged higher"
"And though they did hurt me so bad"
"In the fear and alarm"
"You did not desert me"
"My brothers in arms"
The motto was, for some unknown reason, omitted from some translations of the book, including the English and French translation.
Summary.
Geralt recovers in Brokilon forest after the Thanedd incident, but he is intent on leaving as quickly as possible and continuing on his path to find Ciri. In Brokilon, he meets a young woman who will follow him on his journey towards Nilfgaard. Meanwhile, Ciri has settled into a life with some people elsewhere whom she finally can call her friends. The witcher, accompanied by Dandelion and the young woman he meets in Brokilon, undertake a dangerous journey, meeting new people along the way and discovering the truth about the mysterious Black Rider who has been plaguing Ciri's dreams. One of the new friends they make along the way turns out to be rather interesting...
While recovering in Brokilon from his injuries sustained during the Thanedd coup, Geralt meets Milva, a hunter and expert archer. Her mastery of the bow is unequalled. Despite not particularly liking the convalescing witcher, she decides to follow Geralt, who is accompanied by Dandelion, on his way towards Nilfgaard and hopefully, Ciri. The journey is not easy, the war is encroaching seemingly from all directions and nearly every city is ablaze.
Along their journey they meet a group of dwarves led by one Zoltan Chivay. As it seems they are all going in the same direction, Geralt's party joins the group who are also shepherding some refugee women and children.
At several points in their journey, Geralt and his companions come across Cahir, the erstwhile "Black Rider" that plagued Ciri's dreams. Initially, the knight is being transported as a prisoner by some hawkers, when Geralt spares his life for the second time. However, the witcher wants nothing to do with the young Nilfgaardian and leaves him to his own devices, Cahir is ever persistent and continues to shadow the witcher and his entourage. Eventually, through Milva's intervention, the young knight comes to join the group.
Finally, the troupe is joined by Regis, a vampire, some might say "monster", who rather surprisingly becomes the monster hunter's good friend. Regis proves invaluable for his medical skills.
As the group travels east, they are inevitably caught between the warring factions which leads them into the thick of the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga where the group is pivotal in queen Meve's victory. Geralt had previously named himself "Geralt of Rivia" for credibility sake, however, it is shortly after this battle that Geralt is coincidentally knighted by the queen and officially becomes "Geralt of Rivia".
Meanwhile, Ciri has settled into life with a party of young rebels who call themselves the Rats and has become known as "Falka". With the Rats, she experiences killing on quite a regular basis, but also forms a strong bond with Mistle. Killing ultimately becomes an obsession for the former princess.
Another background story revolves around the formation of the Lodge of Sorceresses. It turns out that Francesca Findabair managed to capture and compress Yennefer into a jade figurine following the events at Thanedd Island. It appears that the Lodge is very keen on using Ciri to their advantage in controlling the politics and prioritizing magic, which leads them to indirectly force Yennefer into joining their group. One Nilfgaardian sorceress, Fringilla Vigo, manages to help Yennefer escape from one of the Lodge meetings to rescue Ciri.
English edition.
The art on the current cover of the UK translation has been confirmed to be Alejandro Colucci's take on Maria "Milva" Barring. The same picture was originally used for Spanish translation by Alamut, for which earlier mentioned Alejandro worked as the artist.
In the U.S, cover art has been confirmed as an adapted take of the most recent French edition of the book. The credits for the American edition include illustration by Bartłomiej Gaweł, Paweł Mielniczuk, Marcin Błaszczak, Arkadiusz Matyszewski, Marian Chomiak and the design by Lauren Panepinto.
Amazon's original blurb:
"The Wizards Guild has been shattered by a coup and, in the uproar, Geralt was seriously injured. The Witcher is supposed to be a guardian of the innocent, a protector of those in need, a defender against powerful and dangerous monsters that prey on men in dark times. But now that dark times have fallen upon the world, Geralt is helpless until he has recovered from his injuries. While war rages across all of the lands, the future of magic is under threat and those sorcerers who survive are determined to protect it. It's an impossible situation in which to find one girl - Ciri, the heiress to the throne of Cintra, has vanished - until a rumour places her in the Nilfgaard court, preparing to marry the Emperor. Injured or not, Geralt has a rescue mission on his hands. This is the third of the Witcher novels by Andrzej Sapkowski"

The Tower of the Swallow (U.K.) or The Tower of Swallows (U.S.) (Polish: "Wieża Jaskółki"), was written by Andrzej Sapkowski and was first published in Poland in 1997 and is the sixth book in "The Witcher" series and the fourth novel in the saga.
The U.S. edition was released by Orbit on 17 May 2016, with the first U.K. edition coming out a couple days later by Gollancz on 19 May 2016. The following year, the second U.K. edition came out on 9 March 2017.
Summary.
One day, old Vysogota finds a very badly injured girl in the swamp surrounding his retreat. He saves her life and she tells him her story... the story of Ciri and how she became a cruel killer meeting death at every step. Until she met her retribution - Leo Bonhart, who killed her fellow bandits and captured her.
Meanwhile, Geralt is on his way to find Druids who might know where Ciri is. But someone is determined that the witcher should not find her...
Vysogota, an old philosopher living in the Pereplut swamp, finds an injured Ciri near his retreat and takes her in, caring for her until she is ready to continue her journey. She tells her life story to the old man: how all the Rats were killed by Leo Bonhart, all except for Ciri. As she readies herself to leave, she is convinced that both Geralt and Yennefer are dead. Based on this assumption, she leaves Vysogota to find Tor Zireael.
Meanwhile, Geralt meets an elf named Avallac'h who tells him about a prophecy connected with Ciri. He needs to find some druids who will reportedly know where Ciri is. Yennefer is trying to find Vilgefortz's hiding place, but it is no easy task.
Translations.
For reasons unknown, some of the translations have "Swallow" in its plural form in the title while the original, the Polish title is in singular form. Thus, the most correct translation would be "Tower of the Swallow" or "The Swallow's Tower". The mentioned swallow is a representation of a single person so it feels like a rather big error in translation. The error itself might be related to Polish language complexity; the word "Jaskółki" in itself is in a plural form, however in a phrase "Wieża Jaskółki" it is not, here it is in its 2nd (of 7) declination case.

<doc id="5748" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5748" title="Additional substances">
Additional substances

 
All contain one of six basic substances: aether, hydragenum, quebrith, rebis, vermilion and vitriol, but there are also three additional substances: albedo, nigredo and rubedo. Any given ingredient contains only a single basic substance and potentially one additional, or secondary substance. If all ingredients selected to create a given potion (and "only" a potion, not an oil or a bomb) contain the same additional substance, the resulting potion will provide some additional benefits over a similar potion which uses ingredients which have no secondary substance or varying secondary substances.
Finally there are special ingredients. There are only a few of these and they contain neither basic nor additional substances. Their alchemical properties are inherent and unique.
Glossary entry.
Additional Substances
"An alchemical ingredient can contain one of three additional substances: albedo, nigredo or rubedo. If all of the ingredients chosen for the creation of a potion have identical additional substances, the resulting potion will provide additional benefits beyond its basic effect."- Source: Basics of Alchemy
"Albedo potions: characterized by a lower level of toxicity."
"Nigredo potions: affect coordination and concentration, increasing damage inflicted on opponents."
"Rubedo potions: aside from the potion's primary effect, it also regenerates lost Vitality."
Albedo.
Albedo is an additional, or secondary substance which is present in some alchemical ingredients in addition to the primary substance. If all ingredients used to create a given potion contain albedo as an additional substance, the potion created reduces the toxicity of any subsequently imbibed potions.
Nigredo.
Nigredo is an additional, or secondary substance which is present in some alchemical ingredients in addition to the primary substance. If all ingredients used to create a given potion contain nigredo as an additional substance, the resulting potion will positively affect Geralt's coordination and focus, increasing his chances of hitting opponents.
Rubedo.
Rubedo is an additional, or secondary substance which is present in some alchemical ingredients in addition to the primary substance. If all ingredients used to create a given potion contain rubedo as an additional substance, the resulting potion will increase the regeneration rate of vitality in addition to the potion's original effect.
Special ingredients.
Special ingredients are unique items which can be obtained by slaying particular monsters, and occasionally, from plants. These can be used to create special mutagenic potions with powerful effects (often granting additional talents to be used to obtain skills, or granting special skills directly).

Dwarven blacksmith shop

The dwarven blacksmith shop in Little Mahakam, the non-human district of Vizima's Temple Quarter, is run by Malcolm Stein, the blacksmith and his apprentice, the trader. They will serve only people who come recommended, and will not have their weapons be used against nonhumans. How can you tell if he will deal with you?
This is one of the only places you can get a lightning rod made. The Order armorer would not know one if he tripped over it and was subsequently struck by lightning. You can also buy and sell goods here:
This should not be confused with the dwarven blacksmith's house located just east of here. Despite the fact that the mouse-over text on the door does say "house" not "shop", narratively, it is the shop.

<doc id="5750" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5750" title="Alchemist">
Alchemist

Alchemists are those who practise alchemy, generally pertaining to natural elements like metals, as well as potions and rare ingredients, and are found throughout the world. The following are notable examples:
"The Witcher".
In "The Witcher", most alchemists are also merchants and at least one is a witch. In fact, the only known alchemist in the game who is not also a merchant is Azar Javed.
During the quests Little Shop of Dreams and The Scent of Incense, Geralt attempts to get the formula for some suspicious incense for a local alchemist, Vencel Pugg.
There is also an "Alchemist" skill in the alchemy tree in the Character panel.
Alchemists sell alchemical ingredients, and therefore make it easier for Geralt to find the ingredients he needs for . They are very similar to herbalists, but typically sell higher-quality ingredients and sometimes glyphs and runestones as well, functioning as a specialized type of merchant.

He does pay handsomely for those three however: 600 for the set.

Novice nun

Geralt first meets the Novice nun (or "Novice nurse") at St. Lebioda's Hospital. She tells him about the goddess Melitele and about sacrifices of fruits, plants or flowers on Melitele's altars. Sacrifices of flowers like tulips, orchids, roses, etc... are not acceptable. Only sacrifices of fruit like grapes, blueberries, raspberries, or dried fruit are worthy.
Later in Chapter II, if Geralt speaks with her again, he can ask a sort of cryptic question to which he gets an equally cryptic reply but it does not seem to impact gameplay in any way. Finally, in Chapter V, he finds her in the Safe house, along with Vaska, Golan Vivaldi, the hermit, the resolute girl and Vetala. They speak about whether or not Ithlinne's prophecy is coming true and she also gives him an update on Carmen and Vincent.

In the window titled "events", duels fought will be placed by your nick.
You will see invitations which be can accepted in the window, from other players, a "challenge" duel (who accept or reject) it, you will select who. Invitations from others are colored red. Deny a challenge by clicking "reject" , and accept using "accept challenge ". Invitations you have submitted have white colors. You can recover a cancelled challenge by clicking "no" when asked for confirmation. Each challenge includes name, class and level of opponents and ranking place when you hover the mouse over the challenge banner.
If you will wish to duel, there is a list of logged player in right bottom corner of screen; choose opponent from the area titled "arena" – and click "FIGHT!". You will be queued for a duel to be held.
The Versus queue is refreshed often, however, you can refresh the window optionally each moment on your own, it refreshes by using the icon " (over and to the side of the data window).
The screen will allow you to invite similarly as in the "Versus" screen. To write his e-mail address, click icon "send". It invites friends in order to combat for glory with them and orens (gold)! This function is inaccessible during beta testing versions beta.
Selection of opponents.
Try to combat with other beginning opponent players when beginning the game; battling wits with the strongest, put aside for later. Also in the future, when you will spread out your range of challengers (and you will), you will find that equal opponents will become the preferred challenge. Victory with considerably weaker opponents does come incrementally, but weakly. With equals you will earn more wins, but you will gain the biggest profits against higher level players than yourself, though it can turn out to be very difficult. It's best to think of tactics when searching for opponents also. If you are specialized in defense against charms, you are wise to duel with sorceresses, most probably, better than with other classes.
Challenging.
In order to start duelling, you must choose your opponent from the front FIGHTS page or on the RANKING page. You can see all of duel players present in the arena window, checking his combat status and wins by clicking his name in the lists. Single duels are listed by witcher, sorceress and then frighteners. This does not mean you have time in the course of a duel to reflect on battles played through – this could be momentary delay. So, the whole arrangement of battles are organized from the top to make this as quick as possible.
Duel Strategy.
The planing panel eneables you to plan a fight, you wish to engage. You have an infinite amount of time to do it and you can resign from making a challenge (or refues a challenge if you were invited to duel) by clicking "Resign from battle" in the lower right corner of the screen.
The duel plainning panel contains all the information you need. On the right handside you have a summary of information about your opponent - his name, class, level, amount of experience, the number of fights both won and lost, gold amount and ranking number. Study this information to adjust your fight style to the enemy.
Planning goes on by configuring a sequence of blows, spells and abilities. From the ones available to you, you select the ones you wish to use. The higher level of the characters fighting, the longer the fight can last. Fights between beginners last up to 4 rounds (or less if one side dies), fights between advanced players can last up to even 6 rounds.
Each round is an exchange of 2 blows. First the challenger attacks and the challenged defends from this attack, and in the second half of the round the challenged attacks and the challenger defends. That's why you select 2 abilities for each round. One attack and one defence.
When planning the fight course, you have to take your fight potential into account, expressed in fury and elements, or however they translated them into English. Some abilities, especially the advanced ones, require battle energy (that is fury and elements). If you have 3 fury points at your disposal, you have to decide whether to use 3 weaker abilities each of which requiring 1 point, or one stronger ability which will eat all 3 points. Fury and element can be rise by buying equipment of learning abilities.
You add abilites to your fight sequence by dragging its' icon with your mouse or by double-clicking on it. Double-click with your mouse on an abilitiy already placed in your sequence to remove it. You can change the order of your blows in an already planned sequence by dragging them to a different position with your mouse.
After having created a desired sequence (for both attack and defence) you can still withdraw by clicking "Withdraw from fight". It won't be possible after having clicked "Fight" button, which is used to ensue the challenge and memorising the sequence of blows.
After having challenged an enemy, you have to wait, til the enemy accepts your challenge and plans his own sequence of blows (this can last long, but waiting for a response from one player, doesn't unable you to duel with oher players). When you are both ready, the duel will commence. Information about it will appear on the "events" list on the "Fight" screen. Click on the icon of the fight, in order to see its course.
The course of the duel.
The course of the duel is presented course on a special screen duel screen. Detailed informations of effects of the blows, skills and spells used by both sides are displayed under the battle animation.
Depending on the levels of the combatants, the duel lasts for 3 or more rounds. Each round is divided into two parts: the first one, when the challenger attacks and the challenged defends himself, and the second one, when the challenger defends from the attacks of the challenged.
The winner obtains experiences points and orens (gold) after the duel. The loser does not gain anything, and sometimes can even lose some experience (but will not lose any levels). Each of the combatants must also cover the costs of healing and repairing the broken equipment.

Harvall is a steel sword which can be found:
It is a much better blade than the default witcher's steel blade, and probably better than any meteorite sword you may have at that point in the game. (You should compare the stats just to be sure.) Regardless, if you find the sword in Chapter II, definitely compare it to your current steel blade and sell whichever one has the worst stats, keeping the better one for yourself.

Also with no import the Knights of the Order outside Loc Muinne are hostile to Geralt on sight, and will not allow him into their camp. It is likely that Geralt would have had to side with the Order in the first game and import.

Harvall returns in the third game and can only be found in four quest-related locations.
The first and easiest to access is during the treasure hunt quest An Unfortunate Turn of Events, and the second is another treasure hunt, A Plea Ignored, which however involves a much higher level enemy.
The other two chests unfortunately require Geralt to have reached level 30 before Harvall will appear in them (but it is guaranteed at that point), even though the locations are usually visited much earlier, so you may want to leave them to loot later:

The North Gate leads to the Royal Quarter of Vizima. This gate, which is located just north of Merchant Street in the Temple Quarter, remains locked and impassible for the duration of the game. The two guards watching it do not really speak. They certainly do not indulge in full-fledged conversations.

The "cemetery gates" can refer to either of the two entrances to the Vizima cemetery: one from the Temple Quarter, and one from the Trade Quarter. They are both known simply as the Gate to the Cemetery.
On the Temple Quarter side, you will find the gravedigger and, on occasion, Hildegard Zollstock. Just outside in the Trade Quarter, you will find the Royal huntsman.

The Gate to the Trade Quarter also happens to be the Gate to the Temple Quarter, depending on which side of it you find yourself.

Dwarven blacksmith's house

Not to be confused with his place of business, this is Malcolm Stein's, or the dwarven blacksmith's house. It is located in "Little Mahakam", the non-human district of the Temple Quarter. It faces both Kalkstein's and Golan Vivaldi's houses, but is separated from them by a low wall. The only access is from an alley off Peddler Street, just north of St. Lebioda's Hospital. It also happens to be the single richest source of wolf's aloe in the entire game. The potted wolf's aloe there grows eight leaves at a time.
This is where the half-elf that was being held by the thugs in the slums during the A Ghost Story quest is staying and where she asks Geralt to meet her to claim his reward.

Malcolm Stein

Malcolm Stein is a dwarf who, together with his apprentice, runs the blacksmith shop in Little Mahakam, the non-human district of Vizima's Temple Quarter. He will serve only people who come recommended, and will not have his weapons be used against nonhumans. So take heed, and do not cross Yaevinn or Malcolm's services will be off limits to you. Alternatively, Zoltan Chivay's word carries a lot of weight with both Malcolm and his apprentice.
His main competition in town is the Order armorer, who has recently acquired some Mahakaman anvils remarkably similar to those confiscated by the City Guard from Malcolm's own smithy. But if things seem bleak in Chapter II, they are even bleaker in Chapter III where his workplace is pretty much reduced to a firepit.
In Chapter V, it seems Malcolm has relocated to the makeshift forge in Old Vizima to help the Scoia'tael cause. It is he who makes the Scoia'tael (elven) variant of the Raven's armor for Geralt. Although he is not specifically identified, the conversation he has with Geralt would only make sense if it was Malcolm.

The Lycanthropy potion (or lycanthropy cure) is one of three possible cures for this terrible affliction. The other two candidates being a shirt woven using five leaves of fool's parsley, or true love. This potion can only be brewed by an experienced alchemist. Now who does Geralt know who is a master alchemist?
It seems that the captain of the guard, Vincent Meis is a werewolf and his beloved, Carmen, desperately wants to cure him. Geralt finds her at the landing in Chapter III where she is preparing to cross the swamp to find the druids hoping they can cure her lover. The witcher quite rightly points out that the swamp is far too dangerous for her and sets off to speak to the Druids on her behalf.

Saint Gregory's Litany is a quest in Chapter V which Geralt undertakes if he chooses the Order path. In this quest, he must find Saint Gregory's litany in order to recreate Raven's armor.
Walkthrough.
After battling his way into Old Vizima and making sure Shani is OK, Geralt can then start exploring the area and it is not long before he finds the makeshift forge where the Order armourer is busily making and repairing armour and weapons for the soldiers fighting in the streets. The witcher asks him if he can re-make Raven's armour. The armourer says he can, but only if he has the right pieces and instructions. He needs an old scroll and a few other pieces.
The scroll, "Saint Gregory's litany", is in Saint Gregory's tomb which is hidden beneath the Striga's crypt on the island in the swamp cemetery. On his way to the crypt, our hero is accosted by Velerad who ultimately locks the witcher inside, trapping him with the striga and leaving him no choice but to deal with that quest as well.
After battling the striga, our hero will have a chance to explore the rest of the crypt. In its deepest, darkest recesses he will find a circle of elements hiding a Wayfarer's stone which provides access the Saint Gregory's tomb. The stone requires a series of three signs to open: Aard, then Aard again, then Igni.
Once inside, he will be set upon by cemetaurs, fleders and a basilisk on the way to his goal, a sarcophagus in the tomb chamber. Once the item has been secured, he simply needs to go back to the Order armourer with the document. Well, he will also need to get the notes of an elven minstrel, the remains of Raven's armour and another piece of armour to actually seal the deal.
Phases.
All the Pieces.
The armorer told me to bring him pieces of both Raven's armor and the armor of a knight of the De Ruyter dynasty, the notes of an elven minstrel, and St. Gregory's Litany. He claims I'll find all these in the swamp cemetery. I can gain access to the underground temple where St. Gregory is interred by solving the elemental puzzle the armorer told me of. I should review the copy of the legend of St. Gregory I have in my satchel. "I must go to the swamp cemetery and find all the elements required to make the armor."
Success.
I found St. Gregory's litany. I need to deliver it and the other items required to make the armor to the armorer. "I need to take St. Gregory's litany and the other items to the armorer." (9000 XP)

The Witcher monsters

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
This is a list, by Chapter, of all the monsters for which you will need a Bestiary entry before undertaking the in any given chapter. You may or may not meet all of them, depending on the choices you make as the game unfolds, but with the Bestiary entry, you will be able to harvest "all" the possible monster parts for any of the beasts you do encounter.
The easiest way to get these entries is to just read the book that contains the entries you need. If you are a cheapskate, then there is some added complexity to getting the entries you need with minimum cash outlay. If money is no object, just buy all the books you need. There is always a merchant selling books, no matter where you are (and buying the ones you have read).
Boss monsters do not require a pre-existing Bestiary entry to extract the special ingredients.
Prologue.
There is only one monster in the Prologue and it is a boss monster, the Frightener. This entry is given to you by Vesemir, no need to track it down, and depending on your choices during the Prologue, you may not even need to kill it. Your witcher associates may do it for you.
Chapter I.
The boss monster is a hellhound, the Beast.
Chapter II.
The boss monster is a golem.
Chapter III.
The boss monsters are the werewolf and the kikimore queen.
Chapter IV.
The boss monsters are Dagon and (arguably) the midday brides.
Chapter V.
The boss monsters are the striga and the koshchey.
Epilogue.

Percival Schuttenbach was an excellent metallurgist, technician, and jeweler from Mahakam. Before opening a flourishing jewelry workshop in Novigrad, Percival spent time with Zoltan Chivay's company and was in fact its only non-dwarven member.
Biography.
On the top of Montsalvat, Percival once found a large goblet carved from a single piece of milk opal with a golden base and rim set in jasper, the goblet of legends. But as he had no need for such a cup at the time and needed to deliver a transport of diamonds and rubies, meant to be used for drill bits and files, he exchanged it for a mule.
He met Barnabas Beckenbauer at one point in time and the two became friends.
In Zoltan's company.
Eventually, Percival joined Zoltan and his band of dwarves for protection after the breakout of the Second Northern War in July 1267, eventually becoming good friends with them. The group soon after waylaid and robbed a rich hawker who tried to flee Dillingen after the townsfolk exposed his trade with the Scoia'tael. The merchant defended his property like a lion, shouting for aid several times before the dwarves attacked him with batons. Intending to fund future enterprises of each individual with the treasure, the group helped load the trunks on a wagon and set off into the forest.
Early the following month, Schuttenbach and the rest of the group had been escorting Kernow refugees, specifically mothers and children, to safety. They met Geralt of Rivia and the witcher's own group for the first time on the way toward the Yaruga river from Brokilon. Chivay advised the witcher to join up with dwarves on their way eastward to refuge, which was accepted. Later on, Schuttenbach sensed porridge with his infallible gnomish nose and stated people had to live nearby. Chivay decided he, Schuttenbach, and Geralt's companions would investigate, while Munro Bruys and Figgis Merluzzo awaited for a signal in a form of a sparrowhawk call.
After crossing into Brugge, the group stopped at the river O. Convinced not to carry the treasure any longer, Zoltan ordered Merluzzo, Bruys, Yazon Varda, and Caleb Stratton to hide it; the rest continued to Fen Carn. Much later, during an unexpected battle between the refugee-killing Nilfgaardians and the Temerian Army, Chivay's company reunited. They evaded death by running to the woods, but Stratton was hit by the 7th Daerlanian Cavalry Brigade. After burying Stratton and mourning his passing, the dwarves continued. They met Geralt and his company once more, in Angren, and at long last the company decided to return home to Mount Carbon.
Successful jeweler.
During the Battle of Brenna in March the following year, Percival avoided conscription by invoking the ancient rules of gnomish religion, despite it being widely known that he would sell the entire pantheon for a pickled herring and not bat an eye. Following the end of the war, he opened a jewellery store in Novigrad, where he used the parrot Field Marshal Duda that he'd bought from Zoltan earlier as a living advertisement, teaching him to shout "Brrrilliants, brrilliants". Soon enough, he had a galore of customers and full cashbox.
With business booming, Schuttenbach opened a branch in Vizima, with the tagline "Where every ring is that special ring". Unfortunately for the gnome, a racist incident happened to him in 1271 which convinced him to pack up and leave Novigrad and move his main shop to Mount Carbon, Mahakam's capital.
Appearance and personality.
While not as strong as his dwarven mates, he was much more agile and perceptive. It made him an ideal scout who could also smell food from a far greater distance than others, thanks to the typical gnomish nose.

Zdenek was an aging champion of fistfighting, considered the world's best boxer throughout Temeria due to never being defeated twice in a row. However, when he went to enter Whoreson Junior's arena in Novigrad in 1272, he was murdered by thugs just outside the arena.
Biography.
Little is known about his past. "Zdenek" was his pseudonym but he kept his real name a secret. During 1270, Zdenek could be found in the southernmost refugee cave in the swamp cemetery, keeping his fistfights to the privacy of his own chamber in the cave. One of his biggest fans was Zahin Schmartz, who would pay 250 for Zdenek's tooth.
After leaving Vizima he went to Flotsam where he became champion soon enough. He also slightly changed his appearance by shaving his head.
In 1272 he ended up in Novigrad where he was murdered by thugs near The Nowhere Inn on his way to join fistfights in Whoreson Junior's arena.

Trade Quarter

Vizima, the capital of Temeria, is the largest city in the kingdom. It is located on the shore of Lake Vizima, at the intersection of important trade routes, one of which is a waterway. Owing to a developed network of roads, the city draws considerable profit from trade. By King Foltest's order, the city is governed by Burgomeister Velerad. The Trade Quarter is home to the wealthiest and most important inhabitants, and both the town hall and the main marketplace are situated there.
The Vizima Trade Quarter is the part of the city where high society lives. These people generally dislike non-humans and people of lesser social rank than themselves, though there are some notable exceptions.
"Vizima's Trade Quarter is teeming with life. It is inhabited by the capital's social elite — nobles, wealthy merchants, townspeople, sorcerers, even Burgomeister Velerad himself. The cobbled streets are kept clean. The brick houses with flowers in the windows are huddled side by side on the narrow streets, testifying to the wealth of the inhabitants. After all, not everyone can afford a home in the best district, situated near the castle of Foltest himself! At the very center of the Trade Quarter lies a large marketplace, where merchants exhibit luxury goods from all over the world. Nearby stands an impressive town hall. Currently, due to the quarantine, only a few people with letters of safe conduct are allowed into this part of Vizima."

Versus character statistics

This article describes the "character statistics" in "" browser game.
Levels and Experience.
By winning the duels with opponents, you gain precious experience. If you collect the necessary amount of it, you reach higher level of initiation into your class mysteries. With each level, you obtain 1 point of talent, which enables you to learn one new skill. Each level also increases your health by 2. Anytime, you can check how much you miss to the next level by placing mouse cursor over experience bar to the left of your avatar.
The following table presents the experience required for attaining each level.
Health.
When you start the game, you have 40 points of health. When your character develops, you gain more points – with each level (30 total) your Health grows by 2. You can increase its level by using special equipment or getting to know some special passive skills.
The more life you have, the more difficult it is to defeat you. In the course of fight, effective attacks of the opponent will reduce your health, and when it falls to zero, you are defeated. After each duel, your health is restored the original level from before the fight (but it's quite a cost).
Oren (gold).
You obtain gold when you win duels. You should always be sure you have some Money for necessary expenses – after each fight you need to pay for equipment repair and healing. When you have enough gold, you may use it to buy new items.
The most beneficial thing is to win fights with opponents stronger than you. Tie duels can also be profitable, but reasonably less than victories. Obviously, losers don't earn a thing and at higher levels may even lose some orens. The amount of gold may be easily checked – you can see this feature on every interface, next to gold coin symbol.
Fury and Element.
Fury and Element are among the most important factors deciding about your battle potential. Knowing a given skill doesn't mean you can use it on and on afterwards. If the skill consumes part of your battle energy (Fury/Element), you can apply it in fight only as many times, as much energy you have. For instance, having 4 points of Fury and 2 points of Element you can use the attack requiring 3 points of Fury only once in a given fight (and you still have 1 Fury point and 2 points of Element left).
At the very beginning, you won't have any Fury or Element points. Later on, together with your character development, you'll be able to purchase equipment increasing the level of particular type of energy (Sorceress additionally has a passive skill – Lore – which increases the level of Element).
Skills.
Skills are grouped into so-called 'trees'. A tree comprises similar skills, for example skills connected with offensive witcher signs are in the tree 'Signs", whereas those related to defensive signs are placed in tree 'Defensive Signs'.
Each profession has its unique skills divided into 8 trees. The trees fall into 4 areas: Strong, Fast, Magic or Special Skills. By clicking on particular area tab, you may see available skills.
You learn skills by paying for them with collected talent points. With each level, you get 1 point.
For 1 point of talent you can learn a new skill on the first, basic level, or improve the skill you already know (i.e. learning it on 2nd or 3rd level). Each skill has 3 levels: basic one and two developed levels. In order to learn level 2, you need to know level 1. So as to learn level 3, you have to know level 2. On the display 'Skills', levels are marked with one, two or three arrows.
To learn a skill from a given tree, you need to know all former skills from this tree (i.e. those earlier on the list) on first level at least.
Rank Position.
Ranking enables you to see the list of players – clear arrangement of tabs makes it possible to group them according to their class, level, number of duels and wins/loses ratio. The more you fight and win – the higher position in the ranking.
'Ranking' display can be used to search for the opponents. If you want to know more about a given player, click on its nick and you'll see the info in the bottom right corner. That's how you can challenge someone who currently is not present on the Arena – but the fight will take place only when the opponent logs in and accepts your challenge.

The Salamandra hideout in the restricted area is only accessible once, during a covert operation orchestrated by Declan Leuvaarden and his secret contact inside the City Guard. It is where Geralt first sees and then speaks to Radovid, the king of Redania. He also finds a seeing stone and a power stone there, the latter being instrumental in his encounter with Azar Javed and the Professor later, at the Salamandra base.

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The Salamandra hideout in the Vizima sewers is located in an old crypt. This hideout is variously known as the "fisstech lab" or the "Bandit's hideout" but whatever the name, it houses the main production line for the fisstech manufacture operation of Salamandra. It can only be access by providing the correct password, unless one is prepared to resort to violence.
It is run by Gellert Bleinheim, the local drug lord. He employs a large "staff" of chemists working day and night to produce the drug — I say "staff" because it is not entirely certain that these men are working there of their own accord. The raw materials are supplied by Bleinheim's brother, Roland from his operation in the swamp.

Home decor

Part of the general backdrop of the game are some very lush backgrounds. Home décor has not been forgotten. Paintings, tapestries and pelts hang in almost every home in Vizima. Official buildings have official looking documents hanging in full view. There are also numerous posters which hang in the exterior locations in the game. This page provides a little art tour of Viziman interior spaces:

Alvaro's Portal

Alvaro's portal is a teleporter which is found in the main chamber of the Salamandra base at the end of Chapter III, during The Unforgiven. It must be activated using a power stone to allow reinforcements from the witcher's allies to come through and aid him during the battle which takes place at the base.
Yaevinn mentioned that the portal was built by his kin, making it of elven origin, something which is also confirmed if Geralt choose to side with the Order. In that scenario, Siegfried blustered on about using such a device as it is clearly of "evil" elven origin.

Power stone

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The Power stone is found on the corpse of a Salamandra mage after a battle at the Salamandra hideout in the restricted part of the Trade Quarter. It is used to activate Alvaro's portal, a teleporter at the Salamandra base. It is found, along with a seeing stone used to activate a telecommunicator, Hartmann's mirror, at the hideout when Geralt is investigating on behalf of Leuvaarden.
Notes.
There are at least two power stones in the game.

Alzur's Shield

Alzur's shield is one of the many spells invented by the famous mage, Alzur. Alzur was also known for having created many horrible monsters, some of which still roam the world, so possibly this spell was a reaction to one of his nastier creations.
"The Witcher".
Alzur's shield is a powerful spell which can be cast on an individual to protect them from harm. Triss Merigold casts it on Geralt on at least one occasion during the game, when she teleports the witcher to the Salamandra base in Chapter III. If Geralt chooses her as Alvin's guardian, she also casts this spell on him during his fight with the Grand Master's conjured minions in the Ice Plains.

The landing at the Lakeside is particularly aptly named as it is literally where Geralt lands when he falls out of a portal in the sky, arriving in the sleepy enclave. Triss Merigold teleports him there, snatching him from the jaws of death — well perhaps arbalesters of death would be more accurate — at the end of Chapter III and he is seen "dropping in" by the Resolute girl who is watching the Underwater City appear that same evening.
Nearby stand the Fisher King's hut and the altar to the Lady of the Lake. It is also here that the witcher meets White Rayla at the end of Chapter IV.

Notice board

Notice boards are a very useful sources of information to a witcher looking for work. Geralt will find a number of these notice boards as he travels through the world. Typically, witcher Contracts are found in this manner in the game.
Notice boards are also where some secondary quests can be started. They also provide some details about current events in the Witcher world. Each game in the Witcher Series has implemented notice boards in relatively the same way.
"The Witcher".
Sometimes "one-time" notices appear. For example, in Chapter II, after all the contracts have been removed from the notice board outside the Hairy Bear, clicking on the board on Merchant Street reveals the following notice:
"Actively seeking capable, open-minded swordsman.Inquiries: Kalkstein, Master of Alchemy"
Mechanics.
Tip: For boards with multiple notices, double-left-click on each notice to add it to your inventory without closing the notice board. This way you can read them as you acquire them.Note: After reading these notices they become worthless to Geralt, since the information is stored in his Journal. Plus they can not be sold, so you can drop all the notices immediately, to avoid cluttering your Inventory. Alternatively you can keep them until you complete the quests as they will be removed from your inventory once you turn them in to the client.
Bugs.
There are several notice boards in ". These are where announcements of contracts can be found.
Similar to their implementation in other "Witcher" games, notice boards in "" typically include contracts, quest information or general information about an area. Many of the non-quest-related notices on these boards will be re-posted if taken down and sometimes new notices will be added as different events occur in the region. Notices that lead to a quest may appear on multiple boards; once the quest has been started they are removed from all boards.
These are where the notice boards in the third game can be found and the messages that can be found here:

The makeshift forge is where Geralt finds either a dwarven blacksmith named Malcolm Stein (Scoia'tael path) or an Order Armorer (Order and Neutral path). Whichever one is there will be the one to make Raven's armour for the witcher. If the neutral path was chosen, Kalkstein will fashion Raven's armour for Geralt and this forge is used only to forge weapons and to sell items as per the Order path.
Additionally, if Geralt chooses the Scoia'tael path, then the blacksmith also functions as a merchant who buys and sells quite a large variety of goods.
Staff.
The staff at the makeshift forge varies with Geralt's choice of path. If he chooses the Scoia'tael path, then the blacksmith is none other than Malcolm Stein, but if he chooses the Order path, then he is served by an Order armourer.

Wayfarer's stones are obelisks which act as magical portals allowing travel between two different places. They are activated by a combination of three witcher signs. In "The Witcher", wayfarer's stones are used to enter and exit three ancient crypts located in the swamp cemetery in Chapter V and each pair is activated with a unique combination of Igni and Aard.
Wayfarer's stone in Southern Refugees' Cave can be activated by combination: Aard, Igni, Aard. This will take Geralt to one of the Ancient Crypts, where he can find Magic Formula. This location is part of A Magic Formula quest, but can be accesed without it.
Wayfarer's stone in Striga's Crypt can be activated by combination: Aard, Aard, Igni. This will take Geralt to one of the Ancient Crypts, where he can find Saint Gregory's Litany. This location is part of Saint Gregory's Litany quest, but can be accesed without it.
Wayfarer's stone in Old Mine can be activated by combination: Igni, Igni, Aard. This will take Geralt to one of the Ancient Crypts, where he can find Bifunctional fiber and alloy recirculator. This location is part of A Gnomish Device quest, but can be accesed without it.
"Side Effects" premium module.
There is also a pair wayfarer's stones which feature in one of the quests in the module. These stones allow passage from the warehouse in the slums to an elven ruin and back. These are activated by casting the Aard sign three times in a row.

The nonhuman camp is located in the northeastern corner of the swamp, not far from the Mage's tower. This is where Yaevinn and his band of Scoia'tael stage their battle with the Order of the Flaming Rose in Force Recon.
A haughty Scoia'tael dressed as a hunter in the camp asks Geralt if he knows about Feainnewedd, a golden opportunity for Geralt to give her a dressing down for her bigotry... or not. He can also ask her about it, not that she will tell him, but she does give him Lara's Gift. If Geralt talks to her again, he can choose to give her the flower, and gets a response that seems to be a dropped plot/translation bug. She will mention "burmarigold", which does not exist in the game and does not result in any journal entries.
Sometimes she will rebuke Geralt claiming that he stinks, which can be remedied by drinking - right, perfume. After that the conversation options are available again.
The same conversation can be repeated after resting or leaving and returning to the swamp, and if Geralt chooses the same responses (give her another flower), she will then tell you about "Green Mould", which also does not seem to result in journal entries. When gifted with a Feainnewedd a third time, she asks Gerald to ""take a look at this fool's parsley". Finally, when she has told him everything she knows about herbs, she'll say: "You know as much as I, dh'oine."" This does, however, cost Gerald an extra Feainnewedd.
In Chapter III, the elves have moved on and the camp, now known as the Salamandra encampment, has been taken over by Roland Bleinheim and his band of Salamandra. They are coordinating the fisstech operation with his brother, Gellert, back in the city. They deal with the gathering of beggartick, a primary ingredient and he runs the lab in the sewers.

"The Witcher".
The highest quality iron ores and state of the art technologies were used in the making of Raven's armor, a legendary suit of armor worn by an even more legendary warrior. It was forged in the gnomes' workshops beneath Mount Carbon, but finished by elves. The songmaster Tyen'sail took an interest in the armor and worked for twelve days straight, each movement of his chisel accompanied by a song of power. It is said that the armor sang a song of victory for its wearer, providing him with confidence and calm during battle.
Three variants of this armor are available in the game:

Raven's armor becomes starting equipment if it was acquired by Geralt during "The Witcher" and a corresponding saved game is imported into "".
The armor was redesigned for the sequel to include a utility belt across Geralt's chest and a book attached beneath it. The inscription on the book when translated from the Common Speech to Polish, reads "Dendrologia Stosowana", which in English translates to Applied Dendrology (the study of wooden plants).

Runestone

"The Witcher".
Permanent runes are branded onto blades to produce silver swords of a higher quality than the base weapon; they can not be used on steel swords. The permanent rune stones are combined in three's.
There are also temporary runes, which Geralt can apply himself. These have blade-enhancing effects similar to oils, and cannot be used at the same time as an oil on a given blade. Temporary runes can be applied to either steel or silver swords and provide a temporary upgrade to the weapon, similar to weapon oil in duration. The enhancement depends on the rune stone used, but all last for a period of 24 hours.
Runes are placed in the rune slots for swords to enhance their base statistics.

Runestones can be applied to empty upgrade slots on weapons.
"Hearts of Stone" expansion.
Along with runewords and glyphwords, "Hearts of Stone" adds two new runestones which are only needed to craft the Dumplings runeword. Unlike base game runestones, both of them must be crafted and the for them are found in specific locations.

Dark alley

The dark alley is the one of the only "markets" in Old Vizima. It is quite abandoned during the day, but at night a few fences roam the area and will grudgingly do business with anyone, even witchers. They will buy and sell almost anything. You can find, or more importantly, convert to cash:
Your path choice affects the fences. When you first arrive in Old Vizima, there will be at least one neutral (blue) Fence in this area. Upon returning to Old Vizima from the swamp cemetery, the fences will not be there unless you are on the neutral path. On the Scoia'tael path there will be a Scoia'tael quartermaster near the gate to the dike instead. On the Order path, there will be an Order quartermaster near the gate to the swamp cemetery instead.

Solitary tower

The Solitary Tower is where we find what is initially described by a messenger as a striga on the loose in Old Vizima. A bit more investigation reveals that while there may well be a striga on the loose somewhere, the thing on top of the tower is definitely not a striga, it is a mutant "like [Geralt]", as Kalkstein points out. This little scene also serves to alert the witcher to the alchemist's presence in the old quarter.

Crypt in the sewers

The crypt in the sewers is (as the name quite obviously suggests) a crypt in the sewers of the Temple Quarter of Vizima, which is behind a locked gate. Geralt is given the key to these gates by the Con artist who hangs out by the sewer entrance every morning between 06:00 and 09:00.
Inside is a fairly standard crypt, guarded by graveirs and ghouls, about a half dozen of each. There is also a nicely stocked chest in the deepest, darkest chamber, along with a campfire and a corpse.

Intoxication

"The Witcher".
Intoxication is one of the more unique and fun aspects of "The Witcher". Basically you can get Geralt "wasted out of his gourd", either deliberately or by accident. What ensues is the fun part. You see the world as a very drunken witcher would, i.e. everything is double or triple and swimming before your eyes. In the isometric view, you get quite a funny little animation of Geralt stumbling around trying to get from one place to another, bumping into stuff and forgetting where he was going along the way. Geralt can still walk sideways relatively quickly and steadily, because he is just talented like that.
However, depending on how you allocate talents when levelling up, the basic effects of being drunk are as follows:
Getting sober.
Fun as it is, it can not be allowed to last for too long. It is counterproductive, after all Geralt even passes out sometimes, and when he wakes up, he is still drunk — though less so. So there are remedies to being drunk:
Cheers!
"The Witcher Role-Playing Game".
You're stumbling drunk. Your REF, DEX, and INT are at a -2 and you are at a -3 for Verbal Combat. there's a 25% chance your won't clearly remember everything you did while you were intoxicated.

Afterwards he can be encountered between 6 and 9 in the morning.
In addition, if the player elects to play judge, jury, and executioner on the con artist for being conned after the quest, it is possible to kill him. Simply meet the npc a little earlier than 6am, hand in the heirloom and as he is walking away, attack him. This action will not incur the wrath from a bounty hunter.

Rituals

<doc id="6547" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6547" title="Ritual">
Ritual

Rituals are a very formulaic and easily learned form of magic. A ritual consumes specific (often expensive) components, and it takes time to perform all of the steps of the ritual. However, rituals can produce results that even exceed the power of .
Many different rituals have been transcribed by mages from the southern tip of Nilfgaardian Empire to the farthest northern keeps. However many of these rituals are regional and rarely seen past the bounds of their home country or city. There are a few rituals which are universal and are taught in magical academies across the continent.
Many magic users are capable only of a single ritual, or perhaps two. These lesser magic users make up most of the magical population: magical adepts who, perhaps, are hydromancers who can see events of the past or present in pools of water. They are considered magical adepts but not mages.

<doc id="6556" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6556" title="Workshop">
Workshop

The Workshop is located East of John Natalis Square, in the Trade Quarter of Vizima (Chapter III). It is the newest weapons factory in all of Temeria, apparently, and produces more weapons than all the swordsmiths combined. However, their motto seems to be "cheap, fast and plenty", rather than quality workmanship. They produce swords, hatchets, armour and arrowheads. For the arbalesters, of course, can not forget them!
When Geralt first enters the shop, he sees a number of tradesmen busily forging weapons, overseen by their foreman. There is also an alchemist, toiling away at his bench in the back. Being the curious type, the witcher strikes up a conversation with the foreman which proves quite interesting. For instance, he learns that there are competing factions within the royal entourage and that at least one faction is stockpiling weapons.
The Alchemist is also interesting to talk to, if a bit abrupt in his manner. He is a snob about alchemy, which he considers superstitious rubbish and its practitioners, notably Kalkstein, quacks. He thinks of himself as a "scholar", not an alchemist. He asserts that science alone will survive the test of time while magic and alchemy will disappear.
Our witcher is never one to let others run down his friends, so he defends his favorite alchemist and in the process manages to convince the "scientist" of the validity of Kalkstein's theories and get a couple of handy books out of the deal: Samum and Secrets of the Southern Masters. He can also trade a Red meteorite for a copy of Zerrikanian Alchemy.

If you find yourself swinging way too many times to kill an opponent, it is probably because they require a tougher approach. How can that be you ask? No one is tougher than a witcher... It is because you are probably using the Fast style of fighting which just chips away at hit points and your opponent has a lot of them. Switch to Strong style (by using the Z-key or clicking on the Strong style icon) and things will proceed much more quickly.

Group opponents

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
In "The Witcher", Geralt should use the Group style of fighting against these opponents, unless they are found alone or in twos, then Fast style tends to be better. This list is pretty much identical to the list of fast opponents, but if Geralt has attained a sufficiently high level of skill, it can include almost any kind of opponent.
Feeling overwhelmed when suddenly surrounded by a large number of previously easy opponents? It is probably because you should be using the Group style of fighting. It is much more efficient (and fun to watch, Geralt can be a human blender). To switch to Group style use the C-key or click on the Group style icon. You see that things proceed much more smoothly.
Examples of monsters.
Generally group style is effective against any group (fast or strong) larger than or equal to two enemies. Geralt does large amounts of extra damage (which is not displayed as floating numbers) when there are at least two enemies. Some times, this works on a group of only two enemies as well.
Listen for the steel on steel/stone (as opposed to the steel on flesh) type of noise that is made when Geralt hits his enemies, which signifies the extra hidden damage was applied.

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
In "The Witcher", Geralt should use the Fast style of fighting against these opponents, unless they are in groups of three or more, then Group style is recommended.
If you find yourself unable to hit an opponent, it is probably because they are quicker than you are. How can this be you ask? No one is quicker than a witcher... It is because you are probably using the Strong style of fighting and your opponent is simply quicker because you are wasting energy winding up for a killer blow and he is not. Switch to Fast style — by using the X-key or clicking on the Fast style icon — and things will proceed much more smoothly.

Ruined village

The ruined village lies on the west hillside outside the ramparts of the Old Manor. It is the site of Geralt's final confrontation with White Rayla in Chapter V. Well, no longer really White Rayla, but her mutated self, courtesy of Azar Javed's mad experiments.

Old manor house

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The old manor was built long ago on a small island off the swamp cemetery and served as the seat of Temeria's rulers until Princess Adda, the daughter of King Foltest and his "sister", died at birth only to return as a bloodthirsty striga. The king did not want to kill his own offspring, so he and his court moved to the newly built castle at the other end of town. The princess was later freed from the curse, but the manor remained vacant and deteriorated over time.
"The Witcher".
The Old Manor house is not actually accessible during the game. Geralt only ever goes into the catacombs beneath it in his quest to hunt down and kill Azar Javed. The manse is situated on the highest point of the small island which has appropriated its name. It is surrounded by a once formidable, but now decaying palisade which overlooks the ruins of a village.
The views from the once grand estate must have been spectacular.

Javed's laboratory

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
In the darkest corner of the catacombs of the old manor, Azar Javed has set up his laboratory. It is from there that he directs his Salamandra operation, using the telecommunicator that is also within and conducts his nefarious experiments. It is not the easiest place to access, being guarded by mutants, greater mutants, mutant assassins, armored hounds, greater brothers and a koshchey.
After battling his way through this gauntlet, Geralt finally faces down the mad mage and ends his reign of terror once and for all. It is over... but is it? Who is that in the mirror? It appears that Javed was taking orders from even higher up, the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, Jacques de Aldersberg himself.

Landing at the old manor

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
"The Comics".
In the Parowski-Polch comic series the landing is the place where Temerian soldiers keep watch on the manor to prevent any actions which could harm Foltest's cursed daughter.
"The Witcher".
The boat landing lies to the north of the old manor. It is the last part of the island that Geralt sees. It is where he meets his ally, either Yaevinn, Siegfried or Triss, to take a boat back to Vizima to report the results of the Salamandra mission to the king. A little exploring reveals a campfire and wrecked vessel which is beached not far away. There is a place of power near the wreck.Other than the lovely views of most of Vizima and environs, there is really nothing more of interest here.

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The koshchey's crypt is so named because it is where Geralt must face a koshchey conjured by Azar Javed. The mage confronts the witcher as he is making his way through the catacombs intent on stopping his progress. He conjures the beast, convinced that it will be the end of our intrepid hero. What a silly mage!

Fence is an informal term for a person who receives and disposes of stolen goods. In "The Witcher", at least two people present themselves as fences: Thaler, who, as it turns out, is not actually a fence, and a tough-looking fellow in Old Vizima in Chapter V. The man in Chapter V "is" a fence, he is not simply effecting a cover for investigative purposes.
He buys and sells pretty much anything from his location in the dark alley, west of the field hospital (other looters and various individuals also mill about there). It is possible that he is only available when Geralt first reaches Old Vizima and that he is no longer available later in Chapter V.
Note.
If you are looking for information on the architectural features in the game, "see" palisade.

Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, better known simply as Regis, was a very powerful higher vampire, and more than four hundred years old when he first met Geralt of Rivia. He was the barber-surgeon of Dillingen. He was very well educated and could be considered a polymath, knowing about many different subjects.
Biography.
In his younger years, Regis had developed some bad habits to fit in with the rest of his kind. While drinking blood wasn't necessary for higher vampires, it was seen similar in substance to alcohol: if one didn't drink they were considered lame. So under peer pressure he began to partake in it and soon found he was no longer shy around vampire women when he was "under the influence". However, his habit got worse and worse to the point he'd spend several nights away before returning to the crypt and just a drop of blood would make him lose control and eventually began to go solo, not caring about any friends going with him or not. He later settled down with a vampire female but not for long as she soon left, and in his grief he dove further into his drinking habit.
It all came to a head, though, when one night he was sent out by some of the boys to fetch some blood. Flying under the influence, he missed his target and instead smashed into the village's well and the villagers nearly killed him, chopping his head off, stabbing him with stakes, and pouring holy water on him before burying him. Fortunately, none of this could actually kill him but, in no condition to move anytime soon, he spent the next 50 years regenerating underground, giving him time to think on his behavior and ultimately he decided to not drink again.
Meeting Geralt.
In August 1267, during the Second Northern War, he was staying at his small summer cottage near Fen Carn, an old elven cemetery way off the main roads and thus relatively free from being disturbed by the war. However, this also meant Geralt and Zoltan's company, also trying to avoid the roads for fear of being killed by the Nilfgaardian Army, came across the cemetery just after dark. Regis quickly hid but the group, extra paranoid with the thoughts of ghouls being in the area, spotted the movement and investigated only to come across a fragrant scent of various herbs and spices. Using the scent trail, Geralt followed it to the hollow Regis had hid in and demanded he come out or else he'd stick his sword into the hollow. Regis then appeared, introducing himself and, after questioning why he was there, invited the group back to his cottage.
Once there, Zoltan went to talk with him before calling Geralt to come see what was inside Regis' home and the group was quickly joined by all the men and Milva as they discovered Regis' mandrake moonshine and began to partake in it. However, Regis abstained, claiming he had made a pact to himself not to drink again, so the rest got drunk while he continued to show his intelligence on various topics, like healing and mandrakes, and soon learned from the now drunk party that Geralt and his group were headed to Nilfgaard in hopes of finding his ward, Ciri. Afterwards, he decided to join the group, claiming the war was more dire than he thought and, as it now sounded unsafe to return to his winter home in Dillingen and too precarious to remain alone near Fen Carn, he might as well go with them.
On the Chotla.
No sooner had they set out though did they run into trouble with a group of peasants in the area, who believed a vampire was in the area. When they demanded that Milva give up her black horse (falsely believing black horses could find vampire graves) the archer punched one of the men, knocking him out, before she vomited. On hearing this wasn't the first time she'd vomited, Regis realized she was pregnant but didn't say anything.
A short time later, when they reached the refugee camp on the Chotla river, the group saw a supposed priest condemning a mentally challenged woman, claiming she was a witch and in cahoots with the supposed vampire in the area. Realizing she was just a scapegoat, Geralt, Zoltan, and Milva stated they'd do a trial of ordeal in their specialties, but the priest demanded instead an impossible trial to prove theirs and the woman's innocence: to remove one of the horseshoes out of the fire and bring it over to the priest and, if they bore no burn marks, they were innocent. Before they could figure out a plan, Regis strode forward, removed one and calmly held it out, revealing no burn marks. However the priest, instead of claiming they were innocent, began to claim it was black magic. Before anything else could happen though, an alarm was cried that Nilfgaardian troops were approaching and everyone scattered.
Being a vampire, Regis was able to hide and saw that Geralt and Dandelion had been taken to Fort Armeria to be executed by a vengeful commander. He then sought out Milva, who'd escaped and now had a new comrade, Cahir, in tow. After explaining the situation, he sent the two to wait at a designated spot for Geralt while he himself went into the camp to get them out, using his abilities to put the sentries to sleep undetected and releasing the witcher and bard. However Geralt, who now realized what Regis was, thanked him for the rescue but warned Regis it was best if they didn't see each other again.
However, Dandelion was wounded in their escape and so the vampire appeared again once they made it to the designated spot to bandage the wounds, ignoring Geralt's drawn sword at his throat. After he finished, Geralt demanded he leave, revealing to the rest that Regis was a vampire. When Regis pushed the witcher about if he ever planned to kill him down the road, Geralt eventually revealed it was unlikely he'd take a contract on Regis if there was one as he doubted "anyone could afford it". Thanking the witcher, Regis then left.
Geralt's company.
Later that day though, when the group had traveled a fair distance and started to set up camp to rest, Regis appeared once more, explaining he was there to change Dandelion's bandages, but ended up in a deep conversation with a sulking Geralt, who wished to continue the journey alone. Afterwards, the vampire went and helped the others prepare dinner and, when the conversation turned to finding Ciri, as they now knew she wasn't in Nilfgaard, Regis suggested to visit Caed Dhu, a druids' circle, as he knew someone there with knowledge about children of destiny. With no better option, the group agreed and set out.
On the way, the others, while having accepted him as a companion, still had a lot of questions and thus Regis began to answer, explaining his earlier years as to why he didn't drink blood anymore and they had nothing to fear from him. He then went on to dispel several myths, like people believing vampires needed to drink to survive or that people could be turned into vampires from being bitten. A few days later, Milva talked to him in private, asking for him to make her a concoction that'd abort her pregnancy. While Milva went to be alone, Regis talked with the others, who essentially confirmed it was Milva's choice. However, after Geralt talked with Milva about other things, the archer decided to keep the baby. Afterwards, Geralt talked with Regis privately and decided instead of cutting through the dangerous Ysgith swamp, they'd try to make their way to the other side of the Yaruga then cross back at a closer point. Initially it started out fine and they soon found a ferryboat, but quickly found themselves between Rivian guerrillas and Nilfgaardians on each bank as they sailed down the river. In the middle of the fighting Milva was struck by a crossbow bolt and Regis quickly got her onto land but she was miscarrying and had to be operated on.
The group later crossed the Yaruga and, through a turn of events, made their way to the Slopes, hoping to find the druids there. However, they were informed the druids moved even further south, to Caed Myrkvid. To top it off, while in Riedbrune, the prefect, Fulko Artevelde, "asked" Geralt to deal with the Nightingale gang under threat of telling his superiors what the group was really up to. Geralt further informed Regis about the startling info given by Angoulême, particularly that the gang knew about Milva cutting her hair not even 10 days ago and that they incorrectly saw 4 in the group when there were 5. Despite Regis asking the witcher not to jump to conclusions, later when they set up camp Geralt accused Cahir of being a traitor, leading to the two punching each other before Milva broke it up. A couple days later, before the company was to split into two groups, one to find Schirrú and the other to find the druids, Geralt apologized, revealing there was another possibility of how the gang knew, with Regis confirming his theory: a mage who tries to view where another is can't see certain beings, like vampires, and thus their count was off because the mage didn't see Regis.
With that in mind, Regis, Milva, and Dandelion made their way to Toussaint's border while Geralt, Angoulême, and Cahir made their way to Belhaven to find the half-elf. However, things went sideways for the latter group and Angoulême found Regis and the others to explain Schirrú, Nightingale and his gang, and corrupt Nilfgaardian soldiers were following right behind her while Geralt was hiding with a wounded Cahir. Regis sent the group to cross into Toussaint, with the idea that at least the Nilfgaardians wouldn't cross due to the duchy's autonomy, while he sought out the other two. Once the vampire found them, he informed Geralt he'd talked with the flaminika, his druid friend, who told him that Geralt was to enter Tir ná Béa Arainne cave unarmed and he'd find answers there.
Waiting in Toussaint.
Now in October, the group reached Toussaint to learn that Dandelion had not been exaggerating that Duchess Anna Henrietta was very fond of him and she warmly welcomed Geralt's company to her duchy and allowed them to stay in Beauclair Palace, including having them invited to festivals and balls. At one such function, Geralt pretended Regis was a count and so the vampire was seated between two countesses and where he kept the whole table entertained with his vast array of knowledge. However, to Geralt's amusement, Regis also falsely stated that silver and garlic could hurt vampires to the table.
When Geralt became involved with the visiting mage Fringilla Vigo and thus the group ended up staying far longer than intended, Regis, who knew there was a succubus in the city, soon started up a romantic relationship with her, even though he knew she was also involved with many other men in the area. He also acted as the voice of reason, keeping the rest from arguing amongst themselves as they waited for Geralt to start traveling once more.
When early January rolled around, the group was once more having breakfast together when, after Geralt left for a contract, Angoulême began to talk to Fringilla about how to convince Geralt to let her to continue traveling with him when they finally set out again, but Regis corrected the young girl, clearly seeing something the rest did not: that the sorceress' only thought was to keep the witcher from leaving. The sorceress and the vampire then debated back and forth, with Fringilla claiming she'd helped Geralt more than the group and he wouldn't dare leave her, to which Regis responded that she was wrong and right now Geralt was merely in a dream state, but would soon wake up to reality and eventually continue his travels to find Ciri.
To Stygga Castle.
Regis' words soon became reality when, early the next morning, Geralt hastily returned from his contract and told everyone to be ready to head out within the hour, having overheard a conversation that told him exactly where to find Vilgefortz, and likely Ciri. The group then made their way through several mountain passes, enduring blizzards and, at one point, spotting horse tracks that started out of nowhere and ended just as quickly, before they finally reached Stygga Castle a couple months later.
Once there, Regis used his abilities to sneak in and have the gates raised, allowing the rest of the company in. As they fought their way through the castle, Regis flew off to scout around and soon found Ciri under attack and quickly dispatched the men before making his presence known by biting and drinking from one of the attackers. However, Ciri ordered the vampire to go and warn Geralt that Vilgefortz was there while she went to go find Yennefer, who was also imprisoned somewhere in the castle. After relaying this information to the witcher, Geralt then sent Regis to try and also find Yennefer.
Regis later came to Geralt and Yennefer's aid as they fought against Vilgefortz and, just as Vilgefortz was about to kill Yennefer, Regis flew in and attacked the distracted mage. However, the mage had a weapon for every opponent and literally ripped the vampire apart before Geralt could stop him, and proceeded to melt Regis and the column he was against into little more than a lump.
Shortly afterwards, Sabrina Glevissig and two fellow sorceresses were entrusted with razing Stygga Castle, the seat of the renegade wizard Vilgefortz of Roggeveen. There they found the remains of Regis, killed by a spell. To extract important information from him, they tried to regenerate him and succeeded, but Regis fled before Sabrina had time to question him more thoroughly.
"Blood and Wine" expansion.
Regis plays a major role in the Blood and Wine expansion. Though he had been slain at Vilgefortz's hands, Regis' remains were found by the vampire Dettlaff van der Eretein. Using a significant amount of his own blood and patience, Dettlaff nursed the other vampire back to health. It was over a year before Regis regained the ability to travel on his own, and his gratefulness to Dettalff made them close friends. Regis noticed Dettlaff's tendency to overreact to his own views on what was right and wrong in society, possessing a very black and white outlook on morality. As Regis understood humans were more nuanced than that, he tried to gently guide Dettlaff and curb his behavior.
The two parted ways for a time and Regis ended up in Brugge, where he set off for his one-time home in Dillingen. There, Regis lived the peaceful life of a rural healer and surgeon, enjoying his neighbors' respect. One day, Regis learned that Dettlaff had been killing prominent members of the court in Toussaint. Feeling that he owes Dettlaff a significant debt for regenerating him, Regis set off to find his old friend and learn why he had gone on this killing spree against humans.
Regis eventually found Dettlaff in a warehouse, where the higher vampire was engaged in combat with Geralt, who had been contracted to kill the so-called "Beast of Toussaint". Regis intervenes, putting himself between them in order to prevent any further injury. He persuades Dettlaff to withdraw, calling the witcher his friend, and quickly heals from the wound dealt him by the other vampire. Happy to see his old friend Geralt once again, Regis explains that he is there to investigate why Dettlaff is murdering veteran knights.
While Regis understands that Geralt has been hired to hunt Dettlaff, he insists that due to their blood bond he has come to an understanding that Dettlaff would not be killing in such a way unless he had very good cause or reason to and thus hopes that the murders can be stopped without killing Dettlaff. Despite that, Regis does reveal while drinking a homemade mandrake moonshine with Geralt that even if someone cut down a higher vampire of his caliber they could be brought back via regeneration afterwards and it would take another higher vampire to administer a final killing blow.
Regis is able to help Geralt by helping him make "Resonance", a potion that had similar properties to a narcotic could give visions of what Dettlaff was planning and other insights into his patterns; however it would require vampire blood in an agitated state, meaning Geralt had to induce Regis into a blood lust frenzy to acquire the needed ingredient. While Geralt was hesitant to do so, Regis insisted that this was the only way but did admittedly inform Geralt that there was a being that could force Dettlaff to appear but the risks were so great that he refused to disclose details.
After taking the potion Geralt learned that Dettlaff had initially befriended one of the intended victims in their initial encounter at the boot cleaners stall where a man had pushed in front of Dettlaff. The victim had berated the man about his lack of manners and allowed Dettalff the other chair thus showing a complete stranger common decency. However, as Detlaff was drinking with his victim, he was handed a note ordering him to kill the man. Though feeling immense grief and shame, the vampire proceeded to butcher his victim.
Through helping Geralt figure out that Syanna, the woman Dettlaff was in love with, was the mastermind behind the murders, Regis helps to lure Detlaff into the open after Dettlaff summons vampires to attack the citizens throughout Touissant in retaliation for Syanna's arrest. Regis can help do this in two ways: the first was to track Syanna's disappearance into a powerful and enchanted story book that was a very carefully illusion that acted as its own world which Anna Henrietta had placed her sister into. The second method however was much more dangerous as it required to meet the unseen elder a vampire so powerful that Geralt could not possibly kill him and is required to appease him using a specific sacrifice.
Regardless, Geralt succeeded in drawing out Dettlaff to his and Regis' location, where Regis attempted to talk down his old friend. Regis was defeated by Dettlaff, who was in turn subdued by Geralt. As only a vampire can permanently kill another vampire, Regis reluctantly killed Dettlaff. After Geralt is rewarded for completing the contract Regis meets with him one last time before leaving Toussaint. It was no longer safe for Regis to remain in the duchy as word of him killing Dettlaff had reached the other higher vampires, and according to old law it is expressly forbidden for one vampire to kill another. Regis however tells a worried Geralt that vampires also adhere to the unspoken rule that as long as he stays away from other vampires they will ignore him.
"Geralt chased Sir Milton's murderer with mad intensity. How this chase ended stands as clear witness to the fact Geralt was facing a highly dangerous foe: the killer led Geralt to an old warehouse, where it set a trap for him. A fight ensued, and at a crucial moment Geralt was saved by Regis, a higher vampire and old friend. Here I must explain that, years ago, Regis had joined Geralt's band of fellow travelers (of which I was a proud part) and set off with us in search of Ciri. Together we lived through many fascinating adventures and Regis proved himself a loyal friend, the kind you can trust with your life. Sadly, the expedition ended tragically for Regis. He was killed by Vilgefortz, who reduced him to nothing more than a wet stain."
"Hence the witcher's immense surprise at encountering his old friend – after all, he had seen Regis die with his own eyes. But the thing is, that was not Regis' "final" death, nor even his first. As a young man, Regis had been a bit of a free spirit and overindulged in the drinking of blood. This lifestyle led to him being butchered by angry villagers. Regenerating from that took him fifty years – or nearly no time at all, for an immortal. When he was back in full health, he kicked the habit of blood drinking for good."
"For years, we'd all thought he was gone forever. Yet there he was, standing in front of Geralt in that dockside warehouse."
"Regis explained he had regenerated and come to Toussaint to find Dettlaff, a friend."
"Such were the dramatic circumstances bringing Regis and Geralt together again in Beauclair. They did not have long to enjoy their reunion, however. They could hear others approaching and Regis, not wanting to risk an encounter with angry humans, agreed to meet back up with Geralt at the cemetery where he had made an altogether comfortable temporary home for himself."
"Geralt found Mère-Lachaiselongue Cemetery and the crypt where Regis not only lived, but had also managed to set up a well-equipped alchemist's workshop. They began to confer. Regis explained he believed his friend had become implicated in some serious trouble. When they figured out they had overlapping goals, they decided to join forces and together seek out the vampire Dettlaff, better known in the duchy as the Beast of Beauclair."
"Geralt also learned how it was Regis had returned to the world of the living. He had been helped by none other than the very one they sought: Dettlaff. In light of this, Regis insisted they find a peaceful solution to the "Dettlaff problem.""
"Geralt and Regis decided that an aid was needed to find Dettlaff, a certain potion called Resonance. To brew it, Regis needed some bodily tissue from the object of their pursuit. Luckily, Geralt had earlier found a dismembered hand belonging to the murderer. Another ingredient needed to brew Resonance was saliva (or salivary glands) from a spotted wight. Having discovered that one such creature resided nearby, Regis sent the Witcher to hunt it down."
"Geralt's encounter with the wight left him with the ingredient Regis needed to brew Resonance. Once he'd delivered, however, he learned there was still one thing missing: the blood of a higher vampire. Geralt thought this would prove no trouble until Regis explained only the blood of a vampire in a highly aggravated state would do. They thus would need to invoke maddening bloodlust in Regis, who had abstained from that vampiric vice for years."
"Regis brought Geralt to Tesham Mutna. This grim place had been used by vampires ages ago to raise humans like cattle. Geralt later said even the air in that place smelled of pain and fear. Regis could not vouch for how he would handle the upcoming ordeal and had Geralt lock him in a hanging cage, from which he was to watch as Geralt butchered."
"Having placed bait to lure out monsters, Geralt began his slaughter. Blood flowed at Tesham Mutna once again, and Regis nearly went mad with desire. In the end, the two friends came to possess the blood of a higher vampire in a state of aroused fury."
"Geralt imbibed the Resonance potion Regis had prepared, allowing him to see a fragment of the day Dettlaff had committed his most recent murder. The trail led the friends to the shuttered up toy shop where Dettlaff had been staying."
"Sadly our heroes did not find Dettlaff at home. They did not leave empty handed, however. After searching the shop, Geralt found a letter which revealed Dettlaff was being blackmailed. The blackmailers had kidnapped his lover, Rhenawedd, and threatened to torture her if he did not do as they said. Thus Dettlaff had killed the targets they designated. After a short consultation, Geralt and Regis decided to split up. Regis was to wait for Dettlaff, while Geralt would go to Anna Henrietta and report on the investigation's progress."
"In their pursuit of the blackmailers, Geralt and Anna Henrietta found themselves at a private residence used for meetings of the Mandragora - an exclusive club for the boheme of Toussaint. The residence's owner turned out to be a woman named Orianna. To the witcher's great displeasure, later that evening they were joined by Regis, in the company of... Dettlaff. In the conversation that ensued, Geralt gathered Regis and Orianna were old friends."
"The entire conversation had a rather surreal nature, seeing as how the duchess had no idea she was speaking to the dreaded Beast himself. Its key outcome was the conclusion that the blackmailers were holding Dettlaff's lover at a place known as Dun Tynne. Geralt pulled Regis aside and they conferred briefly. Geralt was firmly against revealing this information to Dettlaff. To his thinking, this could lead to serious trouble. I must say, I agree with the witcher's reasoning. When a higher vampire loses his self-control, trouble always ensues. Bloody trouble."
"Geralt went to Dun Tynne alone, leaving Regis behind to watch Dettlaff. Or such was the plan, but life has a habit of making a mockery of men's plans. The vampires kept tabs on Geralt's progress through the use of avian allies and thus were the instant he found himself in dire straits. They reacted at once. Soon, Dun Tynne was drenched in blood."
If Geralt decided to see the Unseen Elder:
"Regis helped Geralt gain an audience with the mysterious vampire known as the Unseen Elder. Thanks to this Elder's help, Geralt and Regis found the place where Dettlaff had been hiding. Events then unfolded at a rapid pace. Dettlaff flew into a rage and a fight ensued. Geralt managed to defeat him in a bloody battle, but a higher vampire can only be truly killed by one of his brethren. This was perhaps the most difficult decision Regis had ever faced in his life. He killed his friend, having decided Dettlaff's failure to adapt to this world was a burden his friend could no longer bear."
If Geralt decided to get Syanna:
"Regis helped Geralt find a way to enter the Land of a Thousand Fables. There Geralt found Syanna and brought her to a meeting with Dettlaff."
...and got the ribbon:
"As Regis had feared, his friend proved incapable of restraining his rage and tried to kill his one-time love. Yet right before his blow struck, Syanna disappeared, whisked away to a safe place by the magic ribbon she had taken from the Land of a Thousand Fables. Dettlaff then vented his fury on Geralt and Regis. A fight ensued. Geralt managed to defeat Dettlaff in a bloody battle, but a higher vampire can only be truly killed by one of his brethren. This was perhaps the most difficult decision Regis had ever faced in his life. He killed his friend, having decided Dettlaff's failure to adapt to this world was a burden his friend could no longer bear."
...and didn't get the ribbon / attacked Dettlaff:
"Alas, during this meeting Dettlaff proved unable to control his rage and killed his one-time love. He then said he bore no ill will towards Geralt and Regis and wished to leave, but Geralt refused to let him. A fight ensured. Geralt managed to defeat Dettlaff in a bloody battle, but a higher vampire can only be truly killed by one of his brethren. This was perhaps the most difficult decision Regis had ever faced in his life. He killed his friend, having decided Dettlaff's failure to adapt to this world was a burden his friend could no longer bear."
...and didn't get the ribbon / let Dettlaff go:
"As Regis feared, his friend proved incapable of restraining his rage and killed his one-time love. He then said he bore no ill will towards Geralt and Regis and wished to go his way. The witcher let him do so. Regis decided to accompany his friend and followed after him, hoping to help him regain spiritual balance."

Imbaelk

Imbaelk, also known as Imbolc, (Common Speech: Sprouting) is celebrated in February as according to the elven calendar, giving a name to the third savaed of the year. It heralds the end of winter.
The holiday is a festival of the hearth and home, and a celebration of the lengthening days and the early signs of spring - that's the reason why Imbaelk is often called "Sprouting".
Celebrations often involve hearthfires, special foods, divination or watching for omens, lighting candles or a bonfire if the weather permitted. Fire and purification is an important part of the festival. The lighting of candles and fires represents the return of warmth and the increasing power of the Sun over the coming months. In some regions blessed candles are lit during storms and placed in windows to ward off thunders.
Imbaelk is also traditionally a time of weather divination - people are making predictions about weather in the coming year.

Lammas or Lughnasadh is the harvest-holiday also called the "Feste of the Scythe" or the "Festival of the Harvest", which is celebrated in the first days of August (the "Month of the Sickle"). In the elven calendar, Lammas begins the seventh savaed, and is accompanied by parties full of dance and music.

Saovine

Saovine or Samhain is a holiday of the elven calendar celebrated at the end of October and beginning of November by both humans as well as elves. It marks the beginning of the new year, and the first savaed, with which it shares the name.
People have taken a habit to burn a figure representing Falka, a famous rebel, on a bonfire during the Saovine.
It's considered bad luck to play an instrument or enter a graveyard during the time between Saovine and Imbolc. It's also believed that a child born during the time between the two holidays will become a striga.

Northern Wars were conflicts between the Nilfgaardian Empire and the kingdoms of the Nordlings. Less popularly known as the Nilfgaardian Wars or the Nordling Wars, each one displayed the Empire's desire to subjugate the expanse between the river Alba in the south and the Dragon Mountains up north. Though started by the Usurper, they turned out to be a prominent portion of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis's reign and the 13th century as a whole.
The Black Cloaks first marched north to absorb the neighboring Ymlac and Rowan. Their earliest clash with Nordling people happened around the mid-12th century during the war against Metinna, aided by mercenaries from Temeria no less. However, to imperial historiography, it was the 1239 annexation of Ebbing which launched the proper Northern Wars that lasted until April 1268, when the Peace of Cintra was signed. On the other hand, the Northern Kingdoms beyond Yaruga usually see the Battle of Marnadal in 1263 as the start and place the end in 1272. The latter is because what Nordlings dub the "Third Northern War" gets labelled differently in the Nilfgaardian record.
Be that as it may, the tension, stemming from the huge societal imprint left on afflicted regions such as Brugge, existed well into the 14th century.

Triss' room is like being transported completely from the crumbling fortress to a luxurious alpine castle. I suppose a sorceress requires certain "necessities" of life. It boasts spectacular views of Kaer Morhen valley in several directions and the best bed in Kaedwen apparently, the site of Geralt's first romantic encounter of the game. This last event starting things off rather nicely.

The armory is where Eskel can be found for a bit of sparring after the battle at Kaer Morhen keep. It is on the second floor of the fortress at the east end of the main corridor. There are still a number of weapons and training forms lying around from the old days, and several crates and chests with useful items.

The library at Kaer Morhen looks full of potentially useful books and scrolls, but sadly that potential is never fulfilled. The only thing found there is a few flasks of water. Located on the second floor of the keep, on the north side of the main corridor, it is still one of the nicer rooms in the fortress. It is usually devoid of any human activity, despite what Vesemir might say.

The Evening hall is on the second floor of Kaer Morhen keep, on the north side at the east end of the main corridor. It is a large room, largely empty as is the rest of the fortress. Lambert tends to hang out there after the battle, despite the fact that Vesemir keeps saying he his in the library. A large chest near the window contains some ingredients of value.

The dining hall is the largest chamber on the ground floor of Kaer Morhen. For a place with such an unassuming purpose, there is a lot of action which takes place within its confines. It is where Vesemir can be found for most of the Prologue (he does occasionally wander over to the kitchen). It is where Geralt usually learns about witchers, potions, meditating, and often where he gets his first set of armor and his witcher's sword. The battle against the mage, Savolla, also takes place here.

The second equinox day is the fall or "autumnal equinox", called velen. Observed initially by elves, it was adopted by humans and has become an important holiday on their calendar. An important event was the day of Birke in the year 1133 when the Prophet Lebioda preached to his followers under the big oak tree near Sylvan Dam. On each Birke day, the closing ceremony of the novitiate connected with admission to Melitele's priesthood was organized.

Geoffrey Monck was a powerful mage and member of the Novigradian Union along with Jan Bekker and Giambattista. He was also a founding member of the Chapter of the Gift and the Art, and one of the first Nordlings to master the magic of the Elder Races.
He was the author of "The Magic of the Elder Folk, The Theory and Practice of Using Teleportals", and co-author of "Natural Magic" with Ivo Richert.
Monck became famous because of his habit of trapping djinns in bottles and extracting three wishes out of each genie so ensnared. Apparently, he was able to conjure whirlwinds and hurricanes, as well as levitate with the help of his prisoners. He sealed each bottle with a sign depicting "a broken cross and a nine-pointed star".
Biography.
Novigradian Union.
In the late 8th century, after the first landing of humans, Monck, Bekker and Giambattista signed a pact of non-aggression known as the Novigradian Union with the local rulers, priests and druids to ensure mages did not end up on the throne.
Expedition to Loc Muinne.
Several years later, he set off up the Pontar, known then as the River of Alabaster Bridges, sailing all the way to Loc Muinne. He persuaded the elves there to adopt a group of Source children, including the young Gerhart of Aelle, to be taught by elven sorcerers.
Formation of the Chapter.
In the late half of the 9th century, the first Chapter was installed and their magical laws enacted by Monck, Ivo Richert, Herbert Stammelford, Aurora Henson, Agnes of Glanville, and Radmir of Tor Carnedd. Many mages did not conform to their laws, and so a bloody war broke out, Raffard the White being a casualty.

Falka was the oldest daughter of Redania's King Vridank and his first wife, Beatrix of Kovir. 
Biography.
Childhood.
When her father met the beautiful Cerro, he promptly divorced Beatrix and sent her and one year old Falka packing and back to Kovir. Practically forgotten, she was determined to take back what she believed rightfully belonged to her as the eldest child.
Rebellion.
25 years later, in the 1150s, she began her infamous rebellion, three years after King Goidemar of Temeria and Riannon married. During the rebellion, Falka killed her father, two half-brothers - Heltmult and Denhard - and her father's second wife - Queen Cerro, allegedly with her own hands. The then-pregnant Riannon was also accidentally captured and imprisoned by Falka's rebels in Houtborg Castle.
While in prison, Riannon gave birth to a set of twins and then went mad. Around the same time, Falka also gave birth and left her newborn in the hands of the deranged prisoner. Not long after, the rebellion was quelled and Falka was tried and condemned to die by burning on a stake. According to legend, Falka cursed all the people present and promised that they and their progeny would suffer in the hands of a child bearing her blood.
Appearance and personality.
Falka had long, straight coal-black hair and was said to have looked more elven than her mother, suggesting she was rather beautiful.

The Witcher contracts

Contracts are optional quests which Geralt can undertake if he so chooses. They all come with a reward for the work done and typically entail getting some for another individual who lacks the monster slaying and skinning skills of a witcher. All of these quests can be obtained by reading the notice boards. There is at least one notice board per major location in "The Witcher".
Contract Items.
Once you have read and thereby accepted the contract, the items no longer have any practical use. They can be safely thrown away or put into storage to free up inventory space. If you carry the item with you when finishing a quest (getting your reward), the item will disappear.

There are actually two collapsed towers to the north, in the Swamp. One is just north of the Mage's tower and the other, west of the tower closer to Wyvern Island. Both are previous incarnations of the current Mage's tower which were struck down by the Gods: the first by a terrible storm and the second by an earthquake. The third tower, the Mage's tower, remains intact but impenetrable, to this day.

Ilyocoris

Ilyocoris or Lopustre (Elder Speech: "Cinerea") is a ravenous aquatic creature which inhabits the swamps of Angren. Its skin is brownish in color and its body is long and flat.
While Edmund Bumbler learned a bit about the different variations of the hyphydridae family, he incorrectly thought an ilyocoris (which he called Ichthyovorax bumbleri) only ate fish and small amphibians, and didn't even realize they would also eat people if given the chance. Furthermore, Bumbler didn't realize it already had a name, likely thinking a cinerea was a mythical creature.

Moonblade, or Moon Blade, is a legendary silver sword. According to the tales, it was forged by smiths from Ellander for Wolf Witcher Olach of Ban Gleán who was hired to get rid of a demon tormenting the duchy. It was anointed by one of the few remaining local priestesses of Lilvani, Goddess of the Moon. Folk say that Lilvani herself guided the witcher's blade when he confronted the demon.

This deadly silver sword is given to Geralt by the Royal huntsman in Chapter V as a possible reward (the other possible reward being G'valchir) for bringing in all ten trophy monster heads. Merely killing the monsters is not sufficient, their heads must be returned for the quests to count. It is used against and has little effect on humans.
Described by the Royal huntsman as "splendid", and it is. "Can neither be bought nor sold."
It is the highest damage silver sword in the game, the equivalent steel sword being G'valchir.

&lt;/infobox&gt;It is easy to kill with a bow, girl. How easy it is to release the bowstring and think, it is not I, not I, it is the arrow. The blood of that boy is not on my hands. The arrow killed him, not I. But the arrow does not dream anything in the night. May you dream nothing in the night either, blue-eyed dryad.- Geralt to Braenn, p. 293-4 from "Sword of Destiny" (U.S. edition)
Braenn was a human girl who was raised as a dryad in the Brokilon forest.
Biography.
When Braenn was roughly 9-10 years old, she somehow wound up in Brokilon and, as was the dryads' custom, they took her in and had her drink the Water of Brokilon which erased all her previous memories and proceeded to raise her as a dryad.
Meeting Geralt.
In 1262, when she was no more than 16 years old, a group of men were racing through the forest when they were shot at by Braenn's group. Braenn herself ended up killing Voymir's esquire, a young male around 15 years old. A short time later near the same spot, Geralt entered the forest as King Venzlav's envoy to try and deliver a message to the dryad queen, Eithné, but was given a warning shot by the dryads. After conversing with the dryad leader of the unit, the leader called for Braenn and Dunca to come out while the first continued to question Geralt. Braenn picked up Geralt's sword that he'd tossed on the ground but gave it back when the leader told Braenn to take the witcher to Duén Canell to meet Eithné.
Being too young to know what a witcher was, Braenn initially tried to outpace Geralt, hoping he'd get stuck or collapse from exhaustion. However, she started to wear herself out and realizing Geralt was able to keep up with her, relented and slowed down and asked if he was an elf. After informing her he wasn't, and having picked up on cues that she didn't have a drop of dryad blood in her, the witcher asked Braenn what her name was before she was turned but she stated she didn't remember.
She continued to guide Geralt through the treacherous forest, having learned it well enough to know where it was safe to cross and where to be extremely cautious. Despite the pace though, Duén Canell was still far enough away that the two had to stop and sleep for the night and, as is dryad custom, she hugged Geralt as they slept to keep warm.
Finding a princess.
The next day, as she and Geralt continued to travel through the forest, they heard a scream. Braenn immediately armed her bow, ready to shoot, but Geralt cried out not to as he ran into the brush to find a young girl under attack by a giant centipede. Geralt went in close to attack it to keep it from getting to the girl, but ended up being disarmed by the centipede and pinned down. Just as it moved in to strike, Braenn started to fire arrows, piercing the creature's armor and pinning it to a nearby stump. While the creature would snap one off, another immediately pinned it again, distracting it long enough for Geralt to retrieve his sword and finish it.
However, when the witcher thanked her for saving him, she appeared indifferent to this before retrieving the hiding girl, who Geralt concluded was the missing princess, before she took off into the forest. Braenn released an arrow that just skimmed the child's hair before thudding into a tree trunk, making her drop to the ground. When Geralt rounded on the dryad, asking why she fired on a child, Braenn emotionlessly replied "what of it?" After grabbing the princess and talking to her, Geralt learned she'd ran away from Verden and tried to change his plans to take her back, knowing that the dryads would otherwise try to transform her into one of them. However, this backfired as the girl didn't want to go back to Prince Kistrin and stuck with Braenn, with the dryad telling the witcher he could go back alone but he wouldn't make it very far by himself. Relenting, Geralt continued to travel with Braenn and they soon learned the girl's name was Ciri. Eventually though, it grew dark again so the group stopped for another night to rest.
As the group laid down to rest, Braenn made a note that Ciri was "robust, healthy, and stout" and she'd be very useful to the dryads, making it clear that Eithné would transform the girl into one of them. After Ciri insisted Geralt tell her a bedtime story, he began to tell her with Braenn laying down on his other side, listening with fascination as well. When Geralt finished, Ciri wondered what the moral of the story was, with Braenn asking what a "moral" even was.
The next day, the group reached a point past the Trees where Braenn had to blindfold Geralt, a necessary act to prevent outsiders from knowing how to get to Duén Canell, and said she'd lead him by the hand the rest of the way. However, Ciri insisted that she lead him instead and the group eventually reached Duén Canell. On the edge of the capital, another dryad, Sirssa, greeted Braenn and the two conversed in Elder Speech, with Sirssa asking about Geralt but Braenn informed her he was a witcher, making Sirssa proclaim he wasn't any use to them then. Braenn then led Geralt and Ciri to one of the small huts and bade them goodbye. Shortly after, she returned to the hut to take Ciri with her so Geralt could talk to Eithné and the dryads could transform Ciri.
The Water of Brokilon.
Later that night, Braenn was sent to retrieve the Water of Brokilon to use on Ciri and entered while Geralt and Eithné discussed the future and the destiny of Brokilon and the dryads, causing some emotion to stir in Braenn. After getting his answer for Venzlav, Geralt told Braenn goodbye but warned her it was far too easy to blame an arrow for taking someone's life than herself and hoped she wouldn't be plagued by nightmares of doing so. This caused her to suddenly cry out that her real name was Mona, revealing that the waters didn't entirely erase her memories.
After being told to get a hold of herself by Eithné, the queen then took the goblet from her and had Ciri drink from it, with Braenn silently crying as she watched. However, Ciri showed no signs of the water working on her and when questioned who did she want to go with, she still proclaimed she wished to go with Geralt, making Braenn sigh with relief.
Later on, after Geralt was able to leave with Ciri, the two came under attack by a group of Verdenian mercenaries. After Geralt dealt with the skilled killer amongst them and turned to the one named Junghans, the man tried to rally the rest against the witcher but one of Braenn's arrows suddenly struck and killed the mercenary before more arrows flew through the air from other dryads, killing all the mercenaries as they tried to escape. The druid, Mousesack, then made his presence known and bade farewell to the dryads who disappeared once more into the forest, with Braenn remaining behind to bid Geralt farewell. When the witcher proclaimed he wouldn't forget Mona, she firmly told him to forget Mona, she was Braenn of Brokilon, before disappearing into the forest with the rest.

Col Serrai is a deep valley in Brokilon filled with hot springs and caves; it served as a health resort where Aglaïs and the other dryads help heal the wounded in the 13th century.
History.
In July 1267, after the Thanedd coup, Triss Merigold brought the heavily-injured Geralt to Brokilon, and he spent at 36 days in the valley being healed by Aglaïs, Fauve, and Sirssa, before being visited by Milva, which prompted his leaving.

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Caed Dhu (from Elder Speech: Black Forest or Black Grove) is a forest in Angren, on the right bank of the Yaruga, east to Red Port and west to the Klamat. It is also the location of a druids' circle.
History.
In 1267, Geralt's company wanted to visit the forest to search out the druids for information on Ciri's whereabouts.
While the druids originally lived in Caed Dhu, they were later forced to flee south to Loch Monduirn and, later, Caed Myrkvid.

</doc>
<doc id="6812" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6812" title="Caed Myrkvid">
Caed Myrkvid

Caed Myrkvid is a mist-shrouded forest reminiscent of Brokilon situated within the borders of Toussaint. The grove became the home of a circle of druids who had fled Caed Dhu and Loch Monduirn in Angren. Alders and beeches fill the forest which is, however, dominated by an ancient oak in the heart of the grove. It is the most powerful druidic circle left on the Continent
It was in Caed Myrkvid that the Nightingale gang was finally smashed with the help of some knights-errant as well as Geralt, Milva, Angoulême and Dandelion.
History.
Beginning.
The Circle of Caed Myrkvid was founded by a people or race unknown before recorded history began. For centuries, the Circle operated in isolation, preventing the Druids from teaching the human settlers in Toussaint how to live in harmony with nature. They were more in service to the forest than to the arriving humans.
As the Toussantois consolidated their rule of the land, the Circle came into contact with them. This contact was most notable when the flow of the Sansretour River was altered. The Druids intervened to mitigate the resulting catastrophe.
New Arrivals.
The Second Northern War displaced several Druidic Circles. Two of these, the Circle of Caed Dhu in Angren and the Circle of Loc Monduirn in Sodden, fled the violence towards Caed Myrkvid. In 1267, the Circle of Caed Myrkvid accepted the refugee Druids, resulting in the majority of the Circle now being composed of new members.
These new Druids brought not only the Angrenian Tree Cats but also a deep grudge against the humans who had driven them from their original lands. When one of them became the Flaminika, they strengthened the safety of their new home. For years, rumors spread that the Druids would capture and burn alive any intruders who entered the forest. The new Flaminika decided to turn these rumors into reality. Thus, when the Nightingale Gang entered the forest in pursuit of Geralt and his hanza, the Druids used their Treant to capture the gang members and burn them alive in the wickerman.
Entering Politics.
The wines of Toussaint have always been aged in Beauclair Oak, often putting the Coopers Guild and the Caed Myrkvid Circle at odds. When the Druids started to prevent the Guild from entering their forest and cutting down their oaks, the Guild pressured the Toussaint Monarchy to either expel or destroy the Circle. Fortunately for the Druids, the royal house enjoyed the unspoiled wilderness the Druids cared for and remembered their help with the Sansretour River. As a result, they signed a treaty with the Circle. The Groves of Caed Myrkvid were established as a sanctuary autonomous in its internal affairs. The Coopers Guild was allowed to harvest oak for barrels under strict supervision of the Druids. Additionally, the Druids would cultivate and harvest useful plants for the Toussaint Monarchy.

Horse

A horse is a domesticated animal, often used as a mount or pack beast. In the novels, it is the primary method of transportation. Distances are also often measured in multiples of a "day's ride", which is said to be between 35 and 50 miles per day for very good specimens and perhaps closer to 20 miles per day for "average" animals.
In "", Geralt can use Axii on wild horses to then ride them. Interestingly enough, this will cause the horse to be permanently ridable assuming it doesn't de-spawn. It can also be used on multiple horses, so Geralt could essentially "tame" an entire herd.

Steel sword

Steel swords are the typical weapons used throughout the Witcher lore.
History.
Traditionally, a witcher uses two swords, a steel sword for use on monsters not sensitive to silver or shelled so heavily that only the hard steel can harm them.
The steel swords which witchers make for themselves (or contract swordsmiths to make for them, usually Mahakaman) are traditionally made from either meteoric or magnetite iron, and grant the weapon no superior or magical qualities. Geralt, however, does like to encourage the popular misconception that he wields a supernatural weapon, saying that it brings better pay for the work he does.
Geralt also mentions that the steel sword is often mistaken for being primarily intended for fighting hostile people and while it's true that witchers use their steel swords when fighting against armed opponents, this is only because a silver sword is a relatively delicate instrument. Striking metal armor or parrying an opponent's weapon will quickly ruin a silver sword, unlike a steel sword which can withstand such use with little to no damage.
Gameplay.
In the games, the swords are treated in more general terms: steel is always meant for fighting humans/nonhumans and normal, non-magical creatures like bears, unlike the books where there is more discrepancy.
The distinction is not a strict rule as certain circumstances might have Geralt resort to his silver sword instead; one example being wolves that are summoned by leshens. However, this might be more to do with gameplay mechanics than sticking to a strict convention as constantly switching swords when fighting multiple opponents would hinder gameplay.
Each type of sword occupies a different slot and so players shouldn't worry about repeatedly opening the inventory to switch in-between the two unless one turns off auto-selection of the appropriate sword. Also, while steel swords aren't much different design wise in lore, in the games they tend to have a straighter crossguard than their silver counterparts, likely a visual aid to help tell them apart during gameplay.

Damage

Generally speaking, Damage is the amount of hit points deducted from a target by an object or an non-playable-character (NPC). Mostly we are concerned with damage inflicted by objects wielded by the player character (Geralt), but of equal consideration is the damage received from objects wielded by his opponents. This damage amount can range from 0 to the amount of vitality a target has remaining in .
The player, or Geralt, can inflict damage by the using such as a steel sword, a silver sword, signs or miscellaneous other he finds, and even his fists.

Stacking of Damage.
Damage in "The Witcher" stacks by multiplication. This is best explained with the use of examples.
Case 1:
"(base damage) × 1.5 (Weapon damage bonus) × 1.1 (whetstone) = (base damage) × 1.65"
Case 2:
"(base damage) × 1.5 (Weapon damage bonus) × 2 (necrophage oil) = (base damage) × 3"
Source.
Weapon damage varies with character attributes in "The Witcher 2", so the damage inflicted with any given weapon may not be the same for every player.
In the third installment of series, the injury from weapons is divided into two types:
DPS - Silver Sword, for the damage inflicted, per second, with a silver swords.

Similarly, weapons can only be forged by Blacksmiths. It is also better to sell armor and upgrades to armorers because they offer an extra +20% profit compared to other types of shopkeepers.

There really is no shopping list for the Epilogue. By then, Geralt has everything he needs, or he finds it during the Chapter, there is nothing left to prepare for except battle. You "could" say it would be a good idea to have the following items on hand to be truly prepared for the final battle:

Geralt will fight a boss monster, the Zeugl, during the Epilogue. Consider bringing the other supplies he will need to make the special potion, Zeugl's Vigor, from the monster's remains.

Sword

Until you understand what a sword is, and what purpose it serves in a witcher's hand, you will not pick one up. You are not learning in order to kill and be killed. You are not learning to kill out of fear and hatred, but in order to save lives. Your own and those of others.- Geralt to Ciri,  pg. 108, "Blood of Elves" (U.S. edition)A sword is a long, edged piece of metal, used as a cutting, thrusting, and clubbing weapon in many civilizations throughout the world. It is also the most prominent type of weapon in the "Witcher" saga. Geralt carries two swords: a steel sword and a silver sword. Also, many characters in the novels have their own, named swords:
"The Witcher".
While there are not many swords in "The Witcher", it is still useful to note that there are different kinds. Below is a quick reference list:

Romance card

Romance cards (also called sexcards) within "The Witcher" are a trophy of sorts which can be collected over the course of the game. Whenever Geralt sleeps with a female character (or NPC) in the game, you collect a romance card.
These cards are reminiscent of early 20th century novelty "naughty" postcards. Each card is initially presented during a "romantic cut scene". These cut scenes all open showing a hazy red closeup of Geralt leaning in suggestively to make love to an NPC. The romance card image is then overlaid. Originally, the North American edition of the game had the , i.e. with covered or lacking nipples and buttocks, but with the release of the "Director's Cut" patch uncensored cards are now available in North America without the use of modifications.
Once a card has been acquired, it becomes accessible via the journal as a little heart icon superimposed on the character image frame for each time there has been an encounter. Character entries with a more general moniker, like People of the Outskirts, can only be gained by this way.
Depending on which love interest, Shani or Triss, Geralt decides to go with, you will have two little heart icons on that character journal entry image.

The Choice

The Choice was the first of three incredibly painful trials that young witcher apprentices were subjected to. It consisted mainly of a voluntary decision to follow the special witcher diet which consists of mushrooms, mosses and herbs and grueling physical training. Many did not survive the trial, succumbing to liver or heart failure and sometimes madness, many with being left with excessively aggressive tendencies. The trial was performed in the witchers' laboratory at Kaer Morhen.

<doc id="7036" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7036" title="Witcher Trials">
Witcher Trials

The Trials were processes which transformed the organism using a specific combination of secret herbs, infusions and tests. Those who survived became witchers, gaining superhuman reflexes, speed of reaction, the ability to see in the dark and other attributes making them lethal monster hunters.
Overview.
Composed of grueling tests, the Trials followed after the Choice. During these rites, young adepts were taught sword skill, monster lore, herbalism and rudimentary spells called Signs while also being mutated through mutagens, magic and alchemy. The process was extremely painful and cost plenty of lives. Initiated in the 10th century. it was administered by renegade mages. First by Alzur and his associates, then by their apprentices who kept all vital details a tightly-guarded secret.
However, a tale persisted among the witchers that the Children of Destiny would not require the Trials at all. The knowledge on how to create witchers had ultimately been lost when Alzur's successors died in the attacks on the witcher schools.
Major trials.
Trial of the Grasses.
The first of the Trials to happen was the infamous Trial of the Grasses. An incredibly painful one, it required the absorption of special virus cultures plus alchemical ingredients known as "the Grasses" to modify the physiology of the subject. It took about a week. The grasses in question included corn lily, nightshade, speargrass, wildrye and wolfsbane. Furthermore, mutagenic elixirs were essential as well. Supposedly, albumen of gray scolopendromorphs constituted the basis of witcher mutagens. Before the main portion of the Trial began, one segment of the grasses was served to the children via teas.
The herbs and elixirs were injected directly to immobilized children's veins. Most adepts died by the third day. The survivors, agitated by strikes of sudden madness, would fall into a deep stupor. Their eyes turning glassy, hands reaching for any nearby clothing, and breath loud and hoarse. After being administered the elixirs again, the children's cough would progress into vomiting. They also suffered from seizures, while cold sweat ran down their skin. Thus weakened, the adepts fought with the mutagens, herbs, and viruses penetrating their bodies. When they woke up by the seventh day, their eyes had already turned cat-like. No more than three or, at best, four in ten survived; the rest died in agony. Aside from the eyes, The Trial followed by the Changes granted witcher adepts lightning-quick reflexes, slower aging, physical strength as well as sharpened senses.
Trial of the Dreams.
Consisting of a series of psychedelic visions induced into adepts by supervising druids or mages, the second rite called the Trial of the Dreams further enhanced the witcher trainees' abilities. The Trial, among other benefits, augmented their nightvision. On the other hand, it also sterilized them.
Trial of the Mountains.
The Trial of the Mountains, much better known to Wolf Witchers as the Trial of the Medallion, served as an exam intended to verify what the adepts remembered from the previous stages of training. Would-be Wolves needed to swim across a pond near Kaer Morhen, get through caverns inhabited by an old cyclops called Old Speartip without waking him up, then climb Troll's Head, deal with its mistrustful rock trolls, and get to a Circle of Elements. After activating their medallion at the Circle the Trial was complete. All this was done in groups, as mentors believed that even though witchers were lone hunters they could still benefit from cooperation.
Back in the time of Vesemir's youth, the Trial of the Medallion took place in the Red Swamp instead. It was a dense, cursed bog crawling with evil spirits and beasts. It served not only as a source of cautionary bedtime tale, but also as a trial for young, unmutated, Wolf trainees. The adepts, often unconscious, were transported to the swamp at night with nothing but their medallions and there they had to use their wits to survive the night. No tools or weapons were available to them during this trial, meaning that the trainees would have to use branches as improvised weapons.
Adepts of the School of the Bear, meanwhile, needed to pass a more ruthless version of the Trial. The goal was to reach the summit of formidable Mount Gorgon and retrieve a special runestone as a token of their ascent. Many froze to death before ever finding the summit, their frozen bodies left in the snow to mark the way.
Trial of the Sword.
When one of master witchers doubted at the last moment whether the candidate was worthy of becoming a full-fledged member of the school, the not-yet-graduate had to either defeat a monster of the master's choice or another witcher. If the latter, both sides would wear the traditional armor of the Witcher Order.
Other trials.
School of the Wolf.
At times when the witchers found themselves outside of the Morhen valley, the Trial of the Forest Eyes was used as the final exam instead. During the Trial, adepts were taken out into the woods blindfolded and tied up. They thus had to completely rely on senses other than sight. To pass, they were to return back to their instructors before the next morning. If they were late, if they failed the trial, or if they were caught cheating, an instructor hung them by their feet for one night as punishment.
Due to remarkable resilience to standard trials, Geralt of Rivia and several other adepts were subjected to additional experiments. These experiments were much more complicated and painful. Out of all chosen, only Geralt survived and, completely losing pigmentation in the process, emerged with white hair.
School of the Griffin.
When the adepts of Kaer Seren reached their final Trial, they were presented with a choice. They either completely recited "Liber Tenebrarum" by Silvester Bugiardo or went out to find and fetch an egg from a griffin nest. To Master Keldar's great sorrow, not one trainee has ever chosen the recitation.
School of the Cat.
Placing emphasis on agility and flexibility, the Cats had a final Trial which was reached by gradually walking higher and higher on a tightrope. Meant first and foremost to develop balance in young adepts, the failure wasn't too dangerous at first. Falling off during the final Trial, however, equaled death.

Monster

Monsters are distinguished from other creatures using two primary criteria: dissimilarity to humans and lack of sentience or obvious intelligence. Because of this, some sentient races are considered monsters because they are not humanoid and some decidedly non-humanoid creatures are considered sentient races.
Geralt has his own set of guidelines for judging what constitutes a monster. One of his tests is their reaction to silver. Most magical beasts cannot bear it. Other metrics he uses include intent and circumstance. Overall, the witcher is far more fair in his classification of creatures into monsters and non-monsters.
Even in the game, Geralt must use his judgment to decide what or who is and is not a monster. A list of game monsters can be found .

The Witcher library guide

Welcome to the witcher library guide!
This is a quick guide created specifically for the busy witcher who has little time left for after roaming the countryside chatting up and dealing with their various and sundry troubles. "The Witcher" game is no different really in its portrayal of Geralt's day-to-day routine. He still goes around talking to people and slaying monsters. Special thanks go to for the many, many hours of research it took!
In the course of the game, Geralt gathers journal entries about the various monsters he encounters and the ingredients he can extract from them. He also passes by many potentially useful , so knowing about as many as possible also helps make his life easier.
Most of these journal entries can be obtained by speaking with NPCs, but a few can not be obtained in any other way than by reading the appropriate or scroll. Luckily, many books and scrolls can also be obtained for free, or as rewards for completing quests. That said, there are still a few wiley entries for which no free source exists. To date, that list of entries seems to be:
Below are the books which are necessary to obtain in order to have a complete set of journal entries. After all other means of acquiring the information have been exhausted. Strictly speaking, although some entries can be had for free, their availability earlier in the game is often preferable. Technically, you may want to splash out a bit more to make sure you have all the necessary Bestiary entries "before" starting a new chapter. For that information, see the list of monsters by Chapter.
Necessary books.
The following books are necessary if you want to have every single journal entry available. Otherwise, it could be said that no books are necessary.

Guide for illiterate witchers

Welcome to the Guide for illiterate witchers, also known as practising the fine art of conversation and gift giving. Special thanks go to for the many, many hours of research so tirelessly put in, all in aid of those few witchers who are illiterate either by choice or circumstance.
"What if your poor witcher never learned to read ?" How would he get along? Thankfully, not all information must come from print sources. Here is a little guide which lets you know just what sort of information Geralt can get without reading books or scrolls. All these journal entries are obtained either by speaking with various and sundry NPCs, or by using found items like previously unknown oils, potions and bombs thus revealing their formulae.
Follow the links below and check the "Source" sections to see how any given entry can be acquired without reading.

Mysterious man

The mysterious man is someone who can be found lurking outside Thaler's place in the Temple Quarter at night. Sometimes, he can actually be found "inside" Thaler's house.
Trivia.
The Mysterious man retires to what seems to be his home around midnight, a house which is to the right of the hospital. He enters through a door Geralt can not open.
He also pees sometimes at the side of the abandoned house (with no door) just right next to Thaler's door.

The Witcher bestiary

 
A bestiary is usually a volume containing information on different creatures, either living or mythical, depending on the focus of the treatise. In "The Witcher", bestiary entries are acquired through listening to folktales and reading books. Once acquired, they can be found in the Journal. These entries describe the various monsters that Geralt meets or learns about during the course of his travels, including their appearance, primary characteristics and usable parts. In this wiki, those entries can be found in category.
Note.
There was also a Bestiary included with some editions of "The Witcher".

Additional goods

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Additional goods or valuable ingredients are items Geralt can obtain from the remains of beasts he has killed. They lack alchemical uses but some merchants will pay for them, and some quests require them. They do not usually require journal bestiary entries in order to be "available" to Geralt, unlike other skin-able items which do have alchemical uses. Below is a quick list of all the additional goods in the game and the best prices (remember, not every merchant gives the best price).

Seeing stone

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
"This stone radiates strong magical energy."
The Seeing stone is found in the Salamandra hideout in the restricted part of the Trade Quarter. It is used to activate a telecommunicator, Hartmann's mirror, which is found, along with a power stone, at the hideout when Geralt is investigating on behalf of Leuvaarden. According to Triss Merigold, seeing stones retain faint traces of previous communications which can be detected and analysed with the right knowledge and skills. Naturally, the sorceress possesses exactly such knowledge and skills.
There are two seeing stones to be found in the game. The one described above and a second stone, in the cave with Alvaro's portal in the Salamandra base. This second gem is in a small area opposite the portal and guarded by a Salamandra mage who, like his compatriots, loves nothing better than to summon ifrits.

Sergeant Orel was a mercenary in Vizima in 1270.
Biography.
According to himself, the sewers have been infested with monsters ever since a particularly rotten shipment of cabbages arrived. Therefore, he closed the sewer entrances and posted guards outside them. He gives Geralt the key, only if he manages to outdrink him, as a way to prove that he is indeed a witcher and won't die in the sewers, which would fall back on Orel.
He anticipated the Second Northern War, being sure that the Nilfgaardian loss at the Battle of Sodden Hill wouldn't hold them back for long. He sees it as an opportunity to lead a mercenary host South once again.
 "Commander of the mercenary unit stationed in the Temple Quarter, Orel does not seem much bothered by their mission. Like any good commander, he spends most of his days getting piss drunk at the Hairy Bear Inn."

"The Dice Are Cast" is a quest in the "Side Effects" premium module.
Walkthrough.
While meting out a few blows to one of the fistfighters at The Hairy Bear, Geralt notices a beautiful young lady sitting at one of the inn's tables. After winning the fight, he decides to go talk to that woman and soon learns that her name is Milka. She challenges the witcher to a game of dice and who would our hero be to refuse such a request?
While she is a good player, she ultimately can not help but lose all her money to the witcher, but instead of being furious, she offers to let him in on a little secret, if he fleeces Gunn and Orel first. Of course, Geralt makes short work of them owing to an unusually good steak of luck. Milka then hands him the key to a gambling den in the Temple Quarter as a reward and reveals the secret. This gambling den is where rich Trade Quarter citizens gather to play poker, undisturbed, for high stakes.
So it is off to the den! These players prove to be more of a challenge, but eventually Geralt wins all their money as he has everyone else's. He leaves, pleased to have won enough money to get Dandelion out of jail. Milka is also delighted to hear he won.
Phases.
Milka.
I met a very likeable girl named Milka at the Hairy Bear. She offered to play dice with me. I suppose that's one way of earning more coin, though it's just as likely a way to lose some. But there's no gain without risk. I should play her, maybe I stand to gain more than just orens. "I need to play Milka and win whatever I can."
Another Challenge.
I completely fleeced Milka. Funnily enough, instead of being furious at her bad luck she congratulated me. She also offered to let me in on a secret if I beat Orel and Gunn, two other keen dice players. "I need to beat Orel and Gunn. In exchange, Milka will let me in on a secret."
I managed to beat Orel. I still need to beat Gunn before Milka will reveal that secret of hers. "I have to beat Gunn at dice."or
I managed to beat Gunn. I still need to beat Orel before Milka will reveal that secret of hers. "I have to beat Orel at dice."
Milka's Secret.
I managed to beat Orel and Gunn. I should get back to the Hairy Bear and talk to Milka. Now that I've proven that I'm a good player she should let me in on her secret. "I need to get back to Hairy Bear and talk to Milka."
Playing for Real Money.
So, Milka spit it out. A small group of wealthy townsmen meet at a secret location to play dice. She claims they play for high stakes and someone with my skills and luck could get rich quick. "I should go to the gambling den where the wealthy play dice and join them."
Dice Champion.
Looks like I've beaten anybody worth beating in Vizima. I'm still short on coin though and need another way of earning orens.
Failed quest.
I should fetch Dandelion and get him out of Vizima as soon as possible. I won't have time to finish this quest. "I won't be able to finish this quest."

A Debt is a quest in the "Side Effects" premium module.
Walkthrough.
So Dandelion is not really hiding from a rich and angry merchant, but from the local underground kingpin, Mr. Glover to whom the bard owes the tidy sum of 2000 . The issue is not really springing the troubadour from jail, but rather keeping him from being killed over a debt he can not repay. The merchants threats are not the problem at all, and his release from jail is far from uncertain, In fact, it is inevitable.
Geralt decides to help his friend and talk to Glover on his behalf. The latter turns out to be just as unpleasant as his reputation would suggest but he seems open to the idea of having the debt repaid by any means. The two men agree to let Geralt pay off Dandelion's debt and clear his account with the kingpin once and for all.
Gathering 2000 is not the easiest feat, but with marketable skills such as a witcher possesses, there are ways of securing the elusive gold. One such opportunity presents itself immediately upon Geralt's exit from Glover's place. The witcher is immediately accosted by a dwarf named Gunn Hargis who has a proposal which could net some orens.
Other opportunities arise when meets a wealthy nobleman named Everden who has need of the services of a witcher as he collects rare and mystical artefacts in addition to buying monster parts, books and scrolls. He also meets a young woman named Milka who plays dice and needs a house cleansed of ghostly emanations. The priestess at the Temple of Melitele needs herbs and the huntress who usually supplies them is recovering from a nasty consequence of her trade. That huntress could probably use some help. Rumour has it that the sewers need some cleaning, that is witcher work. Hmmm... chances galore for making some quick cash.
Having gathered the necessary funds, Geralt returns to Glover to clear Dandelion's debt only to be told that an additional 1000 in "interest" must now be paid in addition to the original sum.
Pay:
Geralt leaves to find 1000 more orens, then comes back and pays the money.
Refuse:
Geralt refuses and Glover leaves the witcher to his men. A pitched battle follows, but of course our hero prevails. He then proceeds downstairs where Glover and his two pet wyverns await and a second battle follows. Once again, Geralt is the victor. He then proceeds to the jail to get Dandelion out, now that the bard has nothing more to fear from Glover.
Stall:
Geralt leaves after hearing of the "interest." If The Band of Brethren quest is finished, and/or Geralt chooses to throw the last match to the Rivian in Fists of Gold, Geralt will have a band of followers whom he can use to threaten Glover into accepting the original amount, or simply kill him and his lackeys.
Phases.
Dandelion's Troubles.
Dandelion managed to get in trouble — as usual. This time he seduced a city councilman's wife, for which he was promptly thrown in prison. As if that's not enough, he bribed the captain of the city guards to avoid ending up a hanged man. I just wonder where he got the funds... I have a bad feeling about this. I can't believe Dandelion could be so careless. "I need to learn more about Dandelion's situation."
Mr. Glover.
I met some guy who works for the local underworld kingpin. Mr. Glover. I guess I should follow him, talk to Glover about Dandelion. I'm about as edgy as it gets... "I need to talk to Glover about Dandelion."
Paying the Debt.
This ranks among the stupidest things that Dandelion has ever done — he borrowed a large sum of money from the local underworld boss. I talked to Glover and he seems pretty dangerous. If he doesn't get his money back, Dandelion will be meat. Looks like I need to bail him out, repay the debt myself. I doubt that dumbass even intends to pay Glover back, in fact I'm sure of it. Two thousand orens won't be easy to come by in just a few days. I guess I have to put my back into it... "I need to pay Glover 2000 orens. Otherwise Dandelion will suffer."
Coin Enough.
I've collected enough to pay Dandelion's debt. I need to see Glover to settle this matter. "All that work to collect 2000 orens and now I have to give it all up to Glover."
Closure.
Finally — I paid Dandelion's debt. Time to get the bard out of jail. I'm not looking forward to him moan about prison food. "I need to pick Dandelion up at the city jail."

&lt;/infobox&gt;
A Mysterious Treasure is a quest in the "Side Effects" premium module.
Walkthrough.
While wandering around the Temple Quarter, Geralt meets a drunk by the name of Drevin who seems to be feeling rather worse for wear after a doubtless not unusual night of carousing. Apparently the hangover cure he swears by is buttermilk. There is no accounting for some people's taste, nor for home remedies. The drunk tells him that in exchange for a jug, he will tell him about a magic stone which is also a portal to untold riches. Geralt decides to take pity on him and offers to give him any buttermilk he might find, doubting sincerely that any treasure exists.
As luck would have it, buttermilk is not so hard to come by for a witcher with a few different money-making talents and an interest in chatting up the general populace. Our hero then returns to his new acquaintance and gives him the jug. A grateful Drevin then tells him that he can find this magic stone in an abandoned mages' warehouse in the slums and gives the witcher a key.
The magic stone turns out to be a wayfarer's stone. Again, Geralt's vast experience provides a good idea on how to use said stone: a combination of three signs. A few tries later, he stumbles on the correct combination and voilà! he is teleported to some underground elven ruins which are not surprisingly guarded by a few nasty wraiths. Once the specters are dispatched, Geralt finds a treasure-filled trunk near a throne. He then uses the twin wayfarer's stone and the same combination of signs to return to the warehouse.
Phases.
Hangover.
Looks like Drevin has a mammoth hangover. If I do him a favor by finding some buttermilk for him, he'll let me in on the location of a treasure, or so he says. I don't know if there's much truth to the drunkard's ravings but it might be worth a shot. "I need to find some buttermilk for Drevin."
Buttermilk.
I have the buttermilk I promised Drevin. We'll see if he was telling the truth. "I should give Drevin the buttermilk."
Treasure.
The drunkard wasn't lying after all. He gave me the key to an old warehouse. He claims mages once stored their artefacts there. For some reason they were forced to vacate it in a hurry and left behind a mysterious stone. Supposedly, if I cast the right combination of Signs at the stone, it'll teleport me to the treasure. "I must find the magic stone in the mages's storehouse."
Treasure.
I figured out the right Sign combination: Aard, Aard, Aard. I need to look around for the treasure and then find a way to get back. Maybe the same Sign combination will work on the stone on this side. "The treasure Drevin mentioned should be somewhere around here."
Failed quest.
I should fetch Dandelion and get him out of Vizima as soon as possible. I won't have time to finish this quest. "I won't be able to finish this quest."

Walkthrough.
Sewers Locked.
The sewers have been locked since monsters infested them recently. If I want to get in, I'll need to get the key from Sergeant Orel, commander of the mercenaries stationed at the sewer entrance. Like any good commander, he spends most of his time getting drunk at the Hairy Bear. "I should talk to Sergeant Orel. Apparently, he spends most of his time at the tavern."
Proof.
Sergeant Orel demanded proof that I'm a witcher. The only way to convince him is to beat him in a drinking contest. Looks like I have no choice — if I want to get in the sewers, I have to outdrink the mercenary. "I need to drunk Orel under the table."
Success.
I managed to outdrink Sergeant Orel, though my liver probably hates me for it. Good thing I'm a witcher. In any case, I have the key to the sewers. "I can now open the sewer entrance."

Exhibits is a quest in the "Side Effects" premium module.
Walkthrough.
Everden of Rinde is not only interested in monster anatomy and alchemy, he is very interesting in collecting mystical items and artefacts, real or otherwise as it happens. He has an extensive collection which he had opened to the public as a community service. Despite the apparently lack of interest, the nobleman is determined to enhance his collection for the sake of the historical record. He is quite willing to pay for suitable items.
This seems like a potentially mutually rewarding situation since the various jobs Geralt has undertaken around town have resulted in some interesting trinkets but not much actual gold. Everden is very much interested in adding the newly found objects to his collection and rewards the witcher for each one in his own unusual manner.
Geralt finds five artefacts of interest to Everden:
After these five exchanges, Everden declares his collection complete and gives our hero an additional 400 , adding that he has heard of Geralt's efforts to clear Dandelion's financial woes.
Phases.
Rare Items.
Everden of Rinde collects rare items that relate to world history. If I find any such items, he might be interested in buying them. "I should bring Everden all the strange items I find. Maybe he'll want to buy some of them."
A Pendant.
I found a beautiful cameo representing Lara Dorren. Everden is certain to be interested in this. "I should show the necklace to Everden."
Rewarded for a Pendant.
I brought Everden the pendant. He paid me 50 orens for it and then, strangely enough, he threw in some buttermilk. You just never know what to expect from a nobleman. "I should bring Everden all the strange items I find. Maybe he'll want to buy some of them."
Uroboros Amulet.
Everden should be interested in the Uroboros amulet. A snake swallowing its own tail — interesting symbolism. "I should show the amulet to Everden."
Rewarded for an Amulet.
I gave Everden the amulet and got 50 orens and some pot roast. Go figure. "I should bring Everden all the strange items I find. Maybe he'll want to buy some of them."
A Traveler's Journal.
An old traveler's journal — this should definitely interest Everden. I need to get it to him. "I should take the journal to Everden."
Rewarded for a Journal.
I gave Everden the journal. He paid me 50 orens and game me a book about fleders. Not a bad trade as far as I'm concerned. "I should bring Everden all the strange items I find. Maybe he'll want to buy some of them."
A Cane.
It looks like a simple, old cane but I have a feeling it may once have been used by mages. I need to take it to Everden — he should know something about it. "I should show the cane to Everden."
Rewarded for a Cane.
I gave Everden the mage's cane. In return he game me 50 orens and a turquoise ring. "I should bring Everden all the strange items I find. Maybe he'll want to buy some of them."
Sephirah.
A very peculiar stone — looks exactly like something that should be in Everden's collection. "I should who the Sephirah to Everden."
Rewarded for a Stone.
I gave Everden the Sephirah. In return he game me 50 orens and a book about the bryonia plant. "I should bring Everden all the strange items I find. Maybe he'll want to buy some of them."
Collection Complete.
Everden was very grateful to me for helping him to complete his collection of rare and precious items. "Everden rewarded me 400 for completing his collection of rare and precious items."
Failed quest.
I should fetch Dandelion and get him out of Vizima as soon as possible. I won't have time to finish this quest. "I won't be able to finish this quest."

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Fists of Gold is a quest in the "Side Effects" premium module.
Walkthrough.
This quest begins when Geralt engages in his first of several fistfights at The Hairy Bear. Geralt must first win three fistfights at the Hairy Bear. One side benefit of this quest is that one of those three fights is against Gruzil, one of Gunn's "Band of Brethren". Beating Gruzil wins his trust which satisfies one of the conditions set by Gunn before he will part with a magic stone.
Having won three fights, Geralt asks Griffarin, the Innkeeper where more opponents can be found as no one at the Hairy Bear will take his challenges anymore. The barkeep intimates that some prize-fighting goes on at the city jail and the better fighters are there. These fights are arranged by Ralf Duben. So it is off to the city jail for the witcher, but sadly it is only to be told to come back after dark.
 
Later that evening, Geralt finds quite a few rich merchants betting on what is clearly organized fighting. The witcher again approaches Duben and after a few cagey verbal exchanges, is allowed to join in. The guard explains that three men stand in his way to being the champion. The witcher makes quick work of the first two, Lizard and Wrymouth, and gets ready to fight the reigning champion, the Rivian when the latter asks for a private word.
The Rivian explains that he must win the fight in order to secure his release from jail, and asks Geralt to take a dive saying that he will go easy on him, but still try to make things look convincing.
Phases.
Fist Fighters.
I met a couple of money hungry fist fighters at the Hairy Bear. I can probably beat them and make some coin. "I need to defeat all the fist fighters at the Hairy Bear."
What's Next?
I defeated all the fist fighters at the Hairy Bear. Made a bit of coin but it's still not much. Maybe there's some higher stakes place in Vizima. I best ask at the tavern. "I need to ask the innkeeper where I can fight for higher stakes."
Fist Fighter.
I defeated a fist fighter at the Hairy Bear. I still need to beat the others. "I need to defeat the remaining fist fighters."
Experienced Fistfighter.
I defeated a pretty experienced fist fighter at the Hairy Bear. I still need to beat the others. "I need to defeat the remaining fist fighters at the Hairy Bear."
Gruzil.
Gruzil at the Hairy Bear was a tough opponent, I must admit, but in the end even he fell. I still need to defeat the remaining fist fighters. "I need to defeat the other fist fighters."
Prison Bound.
Apparently, illegal fistfights are organized at the city jail. It's potential income, but I could also lose — and I don't just mean a few teeth. I'm inclined to talk to the captain of the guards in spite of that. I'm more than certain he's involved. "I should talk with the captain of the city guards about the illegal fistfights."
Night Fights.
I talked with Ralf about the fights. As it turns out, the captain runs an illegal fighting scheme, but only at night. If I want to try my luck, I need to come back to the hail [] after sunset. "I can fight at the jail after sunset."
Cage Fighting.
Captain Ralf runs an illegal fistfighting scheme at the jail. I need to defeat Lizard and Wrymouth before I can challenge the current champion who is known as the Rivian. The fights only take place at night. "I have to defeat Lizard. I can only fight him at night."
Lizard.
Lizard is down and out. Now I need to prepare for Wrymouth. "I have to defeat Wrymouth. I can only fight him at night."
Wrymouth.
I knocked out the second fighter — Wrymouth. Time for the final showdown. Apparently the Rivian is one hell of a boxer. I need to prepare. "I need to defeat the Rivian. I can only fight him at night."
I defeated all the fighters at the jail and earned a tidy sum in the process. It's still not enough to pay off Glover and I need to find other ways to earn coin. Or I could just kill Dandelion... "I am the fist fighting champion."or
I helped the Rivian get out of jail but I had to go down in the final fight to do this. I hope it was worth it, I hope the Rivian proves to be one stung [] ally. Unfortunately, there's no one left to fight. "That ends my quest for the championship. The Rivian remains undefeated."
Failed quest.
I need to fetch Dandelion and get him out of Vizima as soon as possible. I won't have time to finish this quest. "I'm done fighting. I won't be able to finish this quest."

Guard Dog is a quest in the "Side Effects" premium module.
Walkthrough.
While strolling about the Temple Quarter stocking up on "conveniently available" items, Geralt comes upon a door which has a guard dog. The only way to get through that door is to make friends with the mutt, but, it seems, no ordinary doggie snack will do to appease the beast and our hero is left to guess what a better treat might be.
As luck would have it, not one but two separate opportunities present themselves whereby the witcher can acquire just the treat for the canine: delicious pot roast. Said repast can be obtained either from Griffarin after winning the drinking contest, or from Everden, for finding a relic to add to his collection.
Phases.
The Guard.
A pretty vicious dog guards one of the houses in Vizima. Whoever left the dog there must have something valuable inside... Normally, I wouldn't resort to methods as drastic as this, but I don't have much choice what with time running out for Dandelion. I need to find some food I can use to lure the dog away from the door. "I need to find some food that will lure the dog away from the house."
Pot Roast.
A juicy piece of pot roast — if that doesn't get the dog to abandon its post by the door I don't know what will. I think this house could contain some valuables. "I must try to lure the dog away from the door using the pot roast."
Success.
The dog took the bait. I can try entering the house now — the mutt better not growl at me anymore. "I can try entering the house guarded by the dog."
Treasure.
I managed to get into the wealthy townsman's house. "I should look around for some valuables."
Failed quest.
I had to kill the dog to get into the house. Not my most justified kill, but I'm in now and I'm hoping this proves to be the home of some wealthy merchant. "I had to find another way to get past the dog and into the wealthy merchant's house."

Superstitious is a quest in the "Side Effects" premium module.
Walkthrough.
When Geralt first meets Milka, she relates that she has won a house at dice poker. While this might seem like a boon, Milka has had disturbing dreams about her new property and would like it cleared of whatever malevolent beings might infest it. She wants Geralt to do this, but before she will give him the key to enter the house, she demands a turquoise ring, for luck. Another superstition? Regardless, our hero obliges and finds her a suitable ring.
He returns and gives her the ring, and she keeps her word and gives him the key. She tells him also that anything he finds inside, he may keep as a reward for the task. He then proceeds to her house to rid it of any unwanted guests, leaving it with a "witcher's guarantee" of safety which would allow our gambling gal the opportunity to sell it.
Phases.
Milka.
Milka the gambler won a haunted house playing dice. If I clear it of monsters, I'll be able to keep whatever I find inside. Before I can do that, I need to bring Milka a turquoise [ring] — she believes it'll bring her luck. Only then will she give me they key to the house. "I need to find a turquoise ring for Milka."
Turquoise Ring.
I have the turquoise ring, which I can exchange for the key to Milka's haunted house. "I sure hope Milka likes this ring."
The Key.
I have the key to the haunted house. Once I clear it of monsters, I can keep anything I find inside. "I can keep anything I find in Milka's house."
Treasure.
I managed to find Milka's house. Seems it really is haunted. "I should rummage around the house if I want to get paid for this job."
Failed quest.
I should fetch Dandelion and get him out of Vizima as soon as possible. I won't have time to finish this quest. "I won't be able to finish this quest."

The Band of Brethren is a quest in the "Side Effects" premium module.
Walkthrough.
When Geralt emerges from his first encounter with Mr. Glover, he meets a dwarf named Gunn Hargis. After a quick introduction and exchange of views, Hargis intimates that he and his "Band of Brethren" are not fond of the kingpin and would like nothing less than to help anyone who might thwart him. Our hero also discovers that the dwarf, a local blacksmith and his three colleagues: Griffarin, Gruzil and Navik are all veterans of the war with Nilfgaard and call themselves "The Band of Brethren". There used to be a fifth among them, Kuna, but he disappeared after entering a mysterious portal to look for treasure and was never seen nor heard from again.
It seems this treasure is still within reach for someone as skilled as a witcher, if not the band of veterans. This treasure is offered if Geralt can prove himself worthy to Gunn's three compatriots and Gunn himself. If this condition is met, the blacksmith will reward Geralt with a magical stone which activates the portal. Set our hero sets about his newest task.
Each of the band members has his own idea of what constitutes a test of worth. Griffarin seems to trust only heavyweight drinkers, so Geralt must prove himself to the innkeeper with a drinking contest. Gruvil believes a good fistfighter would make a good addition and so challenges the witcher to a fight. Navik it seems is a talented dice player, so his test involves a little gambling.
Obviously none of these challenges is beyond our hero and he satisfies all three of Gunn compatriots, but Gunn has a test of his own: swordplay. Despite Geralt's protests that a dwarf against a witcher in a sword fight is hardly fair, the blacksmith insists on the duel saying that he would love to actually see a witcher in action. And so, the fight ensues, but luckily Hargis is an able swordsman and not interested in a duel to the death. He is properly impressed by the witchers agility and swordsmanship and says as much. He also rewards him with a magical stone which permits the use the place of power in the cemetery as a portal.
He then heads off to the cemetery to find the place of power mentioned by Hargis. Several ghouls, alghouls and a trio of wraiths later, Geralt locates the place of power at the center of the ruined chapel. As he activates the power source, he is immediately teleported to what appears to be an underground elven ruin.
Only a fool would expect anything less beyond a magic portal than a few nasty surprises in addition to the fabled treasure. So the witcher is hardly surprised to find a few wraiths lying in wait. Geralt dispatches them with relative ease and finds a trunk full of the storied riches. He uses the corresponding interior place of power as a portal to return to the cemetery, which has conveniently been repopulated with the undead in their various forms.
Phases.
A Challenge.
I met a dwarf named Gunn Hargis. He claims to be the leader of the Band of Brethren. Apparently, they want to help me repay Dandelion's debt, but first they want me to earn their trust. It's all a bit mysterious, but I'll give it a shot. I need to find Gruzil and Griffarin at the Hairy Bear and a man named Navik at the cemetery. Then I can go back and see Gunn at his smithy. "I need to earn the trust of all the members of the Band of Brethren."
Griffarin.
Griffarin challenged me to a drinking duel. If I best him, I'll earn his trust. "I need to outdrink Griffarin."
Heavyweight.
I managed to outdrink Griffarin. He promised to tell Gunn that I'm trustworthy. "I need to beat all the members of the Band of Brethren."
Navik.
Navik considers himself a dice poker champion. If I beat him, I'll earn his trust. "I need to outplay Navik at dice."
Lucky Man.
I managed to outplay Navik at dice poker. I have his backing now. "I need to beat all the members of the Band of Brethren."
Gruzil is champion among the fist fighters at the Hairy Bear. I've got to knock him out if he is to think me trustworthy. "I need to defeat Gruzil in a fistfight."or
I recently beat Gruzil in a fistfight. That should be enough for Gunn. I still need to figure out things with Navik and Griffarin. "I already defeated Gruzil in a fistfight. I have nothing left to prove to him."
Iron Fist.
I beat Gruzil to a pulp way back at the start. If you unlocked the fistfighter options at the start, this was easy. He thinks me a good man now. "I need to beat all the members of the Band of Brethren."
Duels.
I managed to defeat all three members of the Band of Brethren at their games. They all think they can trust me now... Gunn Hargis will me my final challenge. I'll find him at his forge. "Time to go see Gunn."
Swords.
Gunn wants to duel me to see whether i'm trustworthy — swords are his weapon of choice. Now you have to defeat Gunn in a sword duel. If you still have a swallow it is easy. Now the passage to the treasure is open. "I need to best Gunn in a sword fight."
Treasure.
The Band of Brethren think me trustworthy enough to let me in on their secret. They also assured me they'd help me deal with Glover. I have the 'key' to their treasure. The entrance is near the Place of Power in the cemetery. Gunn warned me that the elven monster huntress is also interested in the treasure. "I can try to open the passage to the treasure."
I managed to open the passageway. The treasure is within reach. "I came here for treasure — I need to find it."or
I decided to sell the passageway key to the she-elf. She offered me a good price. I'm not really sure what I'd find in the old elven ruins to which the passage supposedly leads. "Five hundred orens is not a bad take on something that sounded so far-fetched."
Failed quest.
I should fetch Dandelion and get him out of Vizima as soon as possible. I won't have time to finish this quest. "I won't be able to finish this quest."

Drevin is a character in "The Witcher"'s "Side Effects" premium module. He could be found stumbling around, drunk or hungover in the Temple Quarter. He had this story about a magic stone which was also a portal to untold riches. He also seemed to have a very interesting mysterious past. Is it true? Who knows, but it might be worth investigating.
"I am a mage hmm. Strike that... I was a mage and now am no more than a drunkard. And I could have been rich, powerful, a renegade..."
"...years ago I was a very promising student of magic, tremendous potential, truly tremendous... Yet fate played tricks and, uh, a certain propensity of mine prevented me from completing my internship and duly mastering the art."
After a particularly hard drinking episode started by a 30 bet with the innkeeper, a jug of buttermilk is all he needs to tell Geralt all about the treasure and where to find this magic stone. It turns out, it is just in a nearby warehouse.
"...the stone inside might interest you. It responds to spells, elemental ones to be sure. I wager if you cast a trick or two it'll take you to treasures beyond."
He then gives Geralt the key to said warehouse and wanders off.

Prince Joachim de Wett was a Nilfgaardian noble who commanded the Verden Operations Group during the Second Nilfgaard War. His youngest daughter, out of many other women, was rejected by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, so the emperor could marry the false Ciri. Because of that, he and Stefan Skellen formed with other nobles a conspiracy to overthrow Emhyr and put Morvran Voorhis on the Nilfgaardian throne. Emhyr however later found out about this conspiracy from the traitor, Berengar Leuvaarden, and sentenced him to death.
de Wett led his army in the decrepitude way, and his troops treated the Nordling civilians in very cruel way. He caused an uprising in Verden, resulting in King Ervyll, who was collaborating with Nilfgaard, being dethroned. He was slowing down the offensive in the third phase of the invasion and blocked by the Middle Army. In the long term that was the main cause of the defeat of the Nilfgaardian armies in the Battle of Brenna.
Biography.
Second Northern War.
In July 1267, Joachim attended the ceremony in Loc Grim Palace between Emhyr and false Ciri, despite his objections to their marriage as he believed like many others, Emhyr was disrespecting his ancient house by cancelling his engagement with de Wett's youngest daughter.
Following de Wett's execution, his skull was purchased and displayed by Caesar Bilzen at his house in Novigrad, along with several other significant historical artefacts.

Ard'aenye is a sword which" used to be" found during Chapter IV of "The Witcher", the first time Geralt entered the fields. It is no longer available in the game, but does appear to be the same model as the sword used by the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose. It closely resembles the description of a gnomish gwyhyr in the novels.
In the , Ard'aenye was once obtainable and used to be found during Chapter V of "The Witcher", inside Raven's crypt, in the swamp cemetery. It was found inside one of the graves of graf Corbus de Ruyter with the Remains of Raven's Armor. After the last patch update, Ard'aenye was replaced by a meteorite sword, regardless of the description in the 's official Game Guide book on page 105.
There are actually two steel weapons called Ard'aenye that Geralt can use on the first game, one is the copy of the sword used by the Grand Master, and the other is the heavy mace used by the class of mutant known as Greater brother, however the Ard'aenye heavy mace can only be equipped using a Save Editing Tool and unfortunately is not possible to tranfer the weapon to the second game using the save import system.

Plants in the novels

The plants and herbs Geralt can gather and use in "The Witcher" games are not unique to the game. Even in the first book translated to English, "The Last Wish", there are mentions of numerous plants.
In the short story "The Witcher", a couple are mentioned as ingredients of potions, but most of the mentions occur in the sixth part of the framing story, "The Voice of Reason" where Nenneke discusses the plants found in the grotto and the climate change in the world with the witcher.
Some of them can easily be matched with the plants found in the game, but not nearly all of them. A good number of them are also plants found in the real world.

Day and night cycle

One of the more interesting features of CD PROJEKT RED's "The Witcher" franchise is the day and night cycle. All the characters adjust their behavior according to this cycle.
"The Witcher".
In the mornings and throughout the day, there is a lively bustle in the streets of the towns and villages. The people go about their daily jobs until their workday is done.
At the town hall in Vizima for example, employees work until the late afternoon. After 17:00, all pens are put down. merchants tend to work longer hours selling their goods. Most end their day around 18:30. Markets are empty and shops are closed by 19:00 at the latest. By then, the majority of the citizenry is safely at home and appearing outside only at the dawn of the following day. Merchants typically open their shops and stalls for business around 08:30.
Only the inns and taverns offer their services all night. These services, however, change according to time of day and the type of clientele. During the day "bona fide" citizens can be found in the drinking establishments, but after sunset, the rather more daylight-averse guests, perhaps those who have something to hide, are more commonly found.
At night, it is not uncommon for Geralt to encounter bandits in the streets on his nightly rounds in town.
The lively hustle and bustle of city life, and also the distractions of battle may distract Geralt (and the player!) from appreciating the great attention to detail shown in the day and night cycle. The images in the gallery below show an entire day in the Witcher world from early dawn to the deepest of night.
Weather conditions also affect the quality of the light. The sky becomes densely overcast due to the rain clouds when it pours, so not all daytime hours are wrapped in beautiful sunshine.
If you acquire the Rising Moon talent, it is only active during the period when the moon is rising (between 21:00 and midnight).
Time Sensitive Quests.
A few quests in "The Witcher" require Geralt to show up at a specified time of the day.

Hagge

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Hagge is a castle in the northern kingdom of Aedirn, located near the north-eastern borders with Temeria and Kaedwen, at the mouth of the Pontar Valley.
History.
Virfuril's reign.
Around 1228, King Virfuril defended Aedirn at Hagge, against King Medell of Temeria's invading army, properly establishing the borders between the two kingdoms.
Northern Wars.
In 1267, the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms, Meve, Foltest, Vizimir II, Henselt and Demavend III met at Hagge, to discuss strategic decisions on the Nilfgaard offensive. They decided to wipe out the Scoia'tael and hunt down and kill Ciri, sending their spies on a continent wide search.
By July, after the beginning of the second northern war and the occupation of Aedirn by Imperial troops, in which Hagge was the last major stronghold to fall, the Temerian army was sent to hold the castle due to Foltest's peace treaty with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis.
At some point during the Northern Wars, a battle commenced at Hagge.

Gwendeith (meaning "White Flame" in Elder Speech) is a fortress in the Blue Mountains inhabited by the Free Elves. It is where elves who did not want to take part in the senseless killing retreated. They called themselves the "Elves of the Blue Mountains". The fortress itself was located at the top of the mountain, overlooking three valleys rising from successive terraces in the Blue Mountains.
The suns rays reflecting off the white peaks give the impression that the whole mountain on which the fortress was built is aflame. Free Elves reside in the valley below.

Located in the west of the country, Rivia is the winter residence of the monarch, and when he or she is in Rivia Castle, honorary white and blue flags can be seen.
History.
Northern Wars.
In early July 1267, during the beginnings of the Second Northern War, the castle, as the whole Rivia, was marched upon by the Nilfgaardian Army led by Field Marshall Menno Coehoorn. Prepared for a siege lasting months, Rivia capitulated after two days under the pressure of the guilds and the merchants who were promised that, should the town open its gates and pay a ransom, it wouldn't be sacked. Coehoorn kept his promise, and swiftly moved the army northward, leaving numbers to occupy the city. 
Duke Ardal aep Dahy, one of Emhyr's advisors, was given control of the city, and used it as a temporary base of operations in the war. Queen Meve however, managed to retake the castle and the city in the Battle of Rivia Castle.
In 1268, the financial situation became the cause of enriched speculations and spread of racism towards non-humans in the city, blamed for most of the disease in Rivia. This, and a lot of other factors, led to a violent pogrom that later took place.

History.
During the Second Nilfgaardian War, the Nilfgaardian Empire conquered the land in order to use its timber for building ships.
Throughtout the war, Meve, Queen of Lyria and Rivia led her guerillas to fight against Nilfgaard in Angren as it had ideal conditions for partisan warfare. She handed them several defeats, including the one at the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga, contributing heavily to the Empire's ultimate defeat.
After much deliberations, it was agreed that Angren would be given to King Foltest.

Vengerberg is the capital city of Aedirn and was once one of the richest and most populous metropolises (numbering six thousand inhabitants even after the evacuation) in the Northern Kingdoms.
A long-distance trade center crossed by many routes and trails, it has a well-developed industry and education institutions.
History.
Foundation.
According to some (not very reliable) sources, Vengerberg had been founded by Prince Venger in the 8th or 9th century, and became the seat of power of Aedirnian monarchs, like the famous Baldwin of Aedirn.
First Pogrom.
Sometime in the 13th century, a pogrom erupted in the city against nonhumans. Yennefer of Vengerberg was involved, and saved the lives of Molnar Giancardi and his family, for which they repaid her for many years with donations.
Second Northern War.
After the Nilfgaardian occupation of Aldersberg during the Second Northern War in mid-July 1267, Vengerberg had been besieged over a week's span and almost all of its inhabitants and garrison, roughly 6,000 citizens, were slaughtered by Nilfgaardians and Scoia'tael. Defeated regiments and civilians began to flee to Temeria and Redania, others heading along the Pontar Valley and the passes of Mahakam, though Nilfgaardian troops pursued, capturing many Aedirnians as slaves. Under Imperial occupation, on the orders of Chief Chamberlain Peter Evertsen, troops dismantled and removed the malt mills, distilleries, weaving mills, and dyeworks in the city.

Aldersberg

Aldersberg is a city in Aedirn, located south of Vengerberg and northwest of Lyria.
History.
Around the 1260s, virgin banes around Aldesberg caused cows to squirt blood from their udders while being milked, a bad omen for the Aedirnians.
Second Northern War.
In mid-July 1267, after the conquer of Lyria and Rivia at the beginning of the Second Northern War, the Nilfgaardian Army led by Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn marched on Aldersberg. King Demavend III and Queen Meve united their forces, around 5-6,000 strong, and charged at the army directly outside the city walls. The 13,000 Nilfgaardians were successful in quelling the Northerners, and Aldersberg came under Imperial occupation.
Several days later, Chief Chamberlain Peter Evertsen was instructed by the Emperor to dismantle and remove the foundries and wool manufactories in the city, so as to return them to Nilfgaard.

Gors Velen

Gors Velen is a port city on the northern coast of the North Sea in Temeria. It is just east of Cidaris, south of Oxenfurt, and northwest of Dorian.
Originally an elven settlement, Gors Velen under the Temerian Dynasty was transformed into one of the most influential trade cities in the west.
History.
Foundation.
Satisfied with the surroundings, the Aen Seidhe founded a settlement in this location. Centuries later, in the 760s, the Nordlings landed. Faced with an expansive new foe, the elves decided to retreat further inland and left the settlement for humans to claim.
Much later, the Nordling settlers, having united the flag of Temeria, constructed thirty-five foot high hewn stone and unfired brick walls, to defend the city against battering rams.
Erland's Deeds.
In 1154, the sorceress Rayli unleashed a fire elemental in the Gors Velen marketplace, killing several people. The monsters rampage was ended by Erland of Larvik and his friends, Nylah and Vaz. While the latter two took care of Rayli, the witcher killed the elemental.
In 1171, Erland returned to the city and took out a contract on a pesta that was causing the city problems, which he soon dealt with.
Foltest's Reign.
Around 1266, between the First and Second Northern War, King Foltest of Temeria introduced "ius stapulae" to Gors Velen, blocking all merchandise routes with inspection sites around the city, and seizing any Redanian or Nilfgaardian goods to be sold within the city.
Locations.
Kardo Street runs through the city connecting the main gate to the sea gate. The town is also well known for its fish market on Winding Street, whose strong aromas attract the local cat population. In the center of the market stands the "Thief's Bastion".

"Blood and Wine" expansion.
In the final expansion for "The Witcher 3", Beauclair is presented as a sizable city on the shores of a nearby lake called Seidhe Llygad. The city is very vibrant, colorful, and, because of its centralized position, can be clearly seen from almost every place in the duchy. Although the city is not as large as Novigrad, it's divided into three districts, only one being walled. The Ducal Palace, renowned for its grandiose majesty, stands at the western edge of the city and is framed by the imposing Mount Gorgon. The city is protected by Knights-Errant and Toussaint Guard.

Lan Exeter is the winter capital and a major port city in Kovir. The summer capital is Pont Vanis. The city is located on a bay in the Gulf of Praxeda in the North Sea at the mouth of the Targo, where it dumps out into the gulf. The city has no streets, and as such, local navigation is accomplished via the Great Canal.
The Grand Canal leads directly from the port to the royal residence, Ensenada Palace. Along the way, the canal is flanked by the palatial estates of the admiralty and local business magnates, not to mention many grand, though narrow homes. The narrowness of these estates and mansions being due to the onerous tax placed on canal frontage.
Regiments protecting the city are called City Watch.

&lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Kerack was one of the minor Northern Kingdoms. Stretched along the Adalatte between the Great Sea and Brokilon, it profited from trade and wood industry.
History.
The area was originally inhabited by the elves, who built a lightower at the mouth of the Adalatte. After they abandoned this region, humans started to settle. They founded the port city of Kerack near the abandoned lighthouse and soon it became a den of pirates, free traders and similar free-minded people.
At the beginning of the 13th century, the city and its vicinities became a base of operations for the merchant and pirate Osmyk. After monopolizing the sea trade in the area, finishing off the competition and winning a few petty wars with Verden and Cidaris, he crowned himself as the first King of Kerack. The coronation was seen as just formalizing the status quo since Osmyk basically controlled the whole region before the ceremony.
Osmyk was followed by one of his five sons, Belohun, who ruled over for 20 years, increasing the country's income with the help of his court mage Lytta Neyd. He was however unable to decide which of his sons should became his successor, which resulted in a plot to replace him with his exiled eldest son, Viraxas. Backed by Rissberg and the Chapter, the coup d'etat succeeded and Viraxas was crowned.
In return for obtaining the throne, Viraxas had to pay off his debts for the Chapter. Apart from raising taxes, he expanded his realm eastwards, thus coming into conflict with the dryads of Brokilon. His hatred towards "eerie wives" grew high and in order to subjugate them, he plotted with Ervyll of Verden and the Order of the White Rose to "blitzkrieg" the forest. The hatred led him however not to victory but to death – a young dryad, the daughter of Duke Jurkast of Maribor, was present when Viraxas' emissaries talked with Foltest about the alliance against the forest, and murdered the King few weeks later when he attended a wedding in Tretogor.
Viraxas had a successor, Tarrand. Not interested in storming the forest, he focused on different affairs, but the conflict with dryads did not cease. By the time the Second Northern War started, four joint Verden-Keracki voluntary expeditions were led to Brokilon by Maria Barring. All of them ended tragically for the dryad-scalpers, because their "guide" was in fact the dryad agent Milva, purposedly luring them into ambushes.
During the Third Northern War, Kerack sent most of its garrison to aid Nordling forces on the front lines. However, this left their defenses weakened and prone to raids by clans of Skellige. Around this time the kingdom was also decimated by the Catriona plague, which sowed the seeds of its ultimate downfall.
By the 16th century, the kingdom had been long gone. Dwindled due to a combination of its inept rulers and the ruling line dying out, its lands were annexed by its neighbors. The capital city, Kerack, became a part of Cidaris.
National Emblems.
The emblem of Kerack is a blue swimming dolphin with red details, placed on gold.
Geography and Climate.
The kingdom of Kerack was stretched along the Adalatte river, from the Great Sea in the west to the Tukajan Foothills in the east. It was bordered by Cidaris in the north, Temeria in the northeast, Brokilon in the east and Verden in the south.

Hengfors was, throughout its history, an independent city-state, the seat of the powerful Thyssen family when they held East March, and the historical capital of at least two kingdoms. Currently, it is the capital of Hengfors League, a federation of various duchies and petty kingdoms of the north. Along with the area adjacent to it, also called Hengfors, the city is a cultural and economical center of the region.
History.
Early settlement.
According to the legends, Hengfors was originally a Skelliger trading factory established near a former Dauk burgwall.
Long ago Hengfors was one of the several petty states of the divided north. It was eventually annexed by Caingorn and, later, by Kovir and Poviss. The House of Troyden established the city as the capital of East March, which was later given to Guido Thyssen by Gerard, the last male heir in the Troyden family.
In the 1220s, Audoen separated Hengfors from Kovir during the Secession of Poviss and formed his miniature kingdom here, which included Arcsea. After it too collapsed, Hengfors was, for some time, independent from Caingorn but was eventually joined to it again after King Niedamir formed his League.
Geography.
Hengfors is situated in Hengfors region at the lower Braa, encircling a waterfall that used to be an obstacle in river transport before the city's construction.
Architecture and urban design.
Hengfors is roughly divided between 4 main quarters—The Royal Quarter, The Merchants' Quarter, The Port Quarter, and Little Aedirn—and a number of smaller outskirts. It's surrounded by canals that allow sailing up and down the Braa without crossing the waterfall in the city's core. Strong walls surround the canals, as the city was fortified to protect the March and Kovir from a possible southern invasion, and the garrison fills a sizable space east to the Royal Quarter.
Since the city became the capital of East March, most of the buildings inside the representative quarters has been built out of brick and stone, as numerous fires used to ravage the city's centre before.

Talgar, formerly a kingdom and now a margraviate of Kovir and Poviss, lies at the foot of the Dragon Mountains in the Far North. It has been the homeland to several members of the House of Thyssen since Godamba Thaess'en was knighted by its contemporaneous king.
Due to the strong local position of the house's branches, Talgar became a shelter to the young former Prince Esterad Thyssen and a large number of exiles still loyal to him after the events of the Secession of Poviss, and the following events which led to the collapse of the East March. During this time the country was ruled by Lady Bernika who took power after escaping from a mage tower in which she was imprisoned due to the suspicions of being afflicted with the Curse of the Black Sun. Her reign was rather strict - rumor had it that the most seen part of the Talgarian landscape during that period were the gallows.
In the far future, the weather changed enough that northern regions, like Talgar, Caingorn, and Kaedwen, were no longer able to grow certain types of produce due to the colder climate.
History.
Settlement.
Talgar was first settled by the Dauk and Wozgor people before the First Landing in the 760s, according to a classification by the historian Arnelius Grock.
Incorporation with Kovir and Poviss.
Previously being a kingdom of its own, Talgar was likely to have been incorporated to the kingdom of Kovir and Poviss around the 12th or 13th century, especially in comparison with other the Kovirian vassals.

Cutscenes

There are two major cut scenes in "The Witcher": the "intro" and the so-called "outro". These two scenes are given the full cinematic treatment and together they frame the story told in the game. There are also a number of less elaborate cut scenes throughout the game. Each Chapter is also framed by opening and closing scenes. Pivotal plot points are elucidated in the same manner.
Intro.
The introductory cut scene, or "intro", depicts most of the short story "The Witcher" by Andrzej Sapkowski. This is the story of the first time Geralt is asked to remove a curse from a Princess. In fact, it is the same curse and the same princess that he must save in the game.
Outro.
The ending cut scene, or "outro", is very dramatic and leaves many unanswered questions. Questions which will hopefully be answered in an upcoming sequel.
Static cut scenes.
Each Chapter of the game opens with a static cut scene. These scenes are made up of large format images which are panned over with a narrative voice-over. Pivotal plot points and some of Geralt's thoughts and memories are also presented in this manner. There are sixty of these though many are path-dependent, so in any single play through of the game a player would only see about half of them.

Intro

The intro is the introductory cut scene of "The Witcher". It tells the story of the first time Geralt is asked to remove a curse from a princess, based on the short story "The Witcher" by Andrzej Sapkowski. Both the intro and outro were directed by Tomasz Bagiński.
The part of the story which is depicted begins with Geralt's preparations prior to taking on the striga but after having discovered Ostrit's presence. It is very faithful to the original tale.

<doc id="7540" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7540" title="Outro">
Outro

The outro is the final cutscene of "The Witcher" and was directed by Tomasz Bagiński, along with the intro cutscene.
Summary.
In the cinematic end sequence, King Foltest is attacked by a masked assassin, and is defended by Geralt. This assassin is very skilled and fights using two swords. The battle is pitched and the outcome does not seem at all certain, but at the last moment, Geralt throws his recently acquired coin purse at the villain. This ploy startles the assailant sufficiently to allow the witcher an unparried blow, which he lands with aplomb, severing one of the attacker's arms.
In the aftermath, both Geralt and King Foltest take a closer look at the villain's face which has now been unmasked. Inexplicably, the man appears to have the same eye mutation as Geralt, as well as potion straps on his armor... to be continued...

Michelet brothers

The Michelet brothers were professional murderers for hire in the Redania area.
Toublanc was the "brains" of the operation, being the only one to attend temple school, and therefore the "de facto" leader, while the other three brothers were the "brawn".
History.
Contract on Geralt.
In early 1267, while in hiding from their contract issued by the mayor, the three were introduced by Vilgefortz to the mage Rience, who hired them to attack an "ordinary man" for 100 crowns. Realizing something was off, Toublanc demanded 200, which Rience readily agreed to. The brothers and Rience went off to Oxenfurt after the man, Geralt, and during the fight quickly realized he was a witcher.
After Geralt incapacitated the four brothers, Philippa painlessly finished off Toublanc with a stiletto, ending the line of Michelet.
Legacy.
Due to their violent nature, the brother's deaths breathed a sigh of relief for many Redanians. For their autopsy, an Oxenfurt Academy physician was summoned to the port, and after examining their wounds believed that the murderer had used a scythe blade mounted upright.

Toussaint is a small autonomous duchy under the banner of the Empire of Nilfgaard, famous for its wines, enabled by the region's volcanic soil and ideal combination of sunny and rainy days. Toussaint does not maintain a large standing army of its own, instead relying on a few regiments of knights-errant, watching the borders and roads in conjunction with Ducal Guard. Toussaint is also one of the few countries in the Continent which doesn't have a Secret Service.
Despite being a vassal state of Nilfgaard, Toussaint maintains high level of autonomy and the Nilfgaardian Empire does not tend to impose imperial authority on its internal affair or violate its borders for the most part.
While the duchy's surface may be fairy and serene, beneath the wine cellars it hides a gargantuan underground system of interconnecting ancient adits, mines and dungeons, as well as natural caverns and tunnels hollowed by lava, allegedly connected with the center of the earth.
History.
Prehistory and ancient times.
For ages the undergrounds of modern-day Toussaint were inhabited by intelligent creatures like korreds, kilmulises, pryskirniks and many others, some of them unknown in witcher tomes even till the 13th century. In the 8th century BR a group of Aen Seidhe elves founded their kingdom here with modern-day Beauclair as its capital. They built beautiful cities made of white marble and ivory.
When the Conjunction of the Spheres occured, it was here where the gate from the vampiric universe opened, trapping vampires in this world. They split into three distint tribes: Gharasham, who stayed in the western part of the Continent, Tdet, who ventured east, and Ammurun, who crossed the Great Sea heading to the west.
Human conquest and fragmented land.
A couple of decades after the First Landing, elven king Divethaf's realm faced a invasion led by Nordling chieftain Ludovic. In 781 the elves from the land around today's Beauclair abandoned their ivory cities and left for the Amell mountains, taking with them all that they could and destroying everything else. Whatever they could not take and did not manage to demolish or burn, they cursed. Ludovic marched into the foothills with his army, demanding Divethaf to surrender and proclaim him as king. A battle ensued after the elf refused and Aen Seidhe army was slain. Weeping over the loss, Divethaf agreed to pay the homage. Next year humans decided to celebrate the anniversary of the victory with a pogrom, genociding all the remnants at the Mount Gorgon slopes. The last untouched by humans elven trace was the hidden necropoly of Tir ná Béa Arainne which continued to be used over the course of subsequent ages, protected by Aen Saevherne.
In the following centuries the main occupation of early Toussantois was apparently mining, as they hollowed many adits and mines. Several dungeons were also constructed then, probably to imprison political enemies – the land was parcellated among several petty lords and dukes. One of such lordships was Epicéa on Gorgon Foothils, near the very place of Divethaf's defeat. Another lordship, centered around Toricella, was the primary military force in fight against the remaining elves, who were finally defeated in 1050s leaving all of future's Toussaint under human control.
One of the most important and landscape-changing events of this period was Nazairi Duke Adam's attempt to regulate the flow of the Sansretour River to his likeness – and unwilling creation of the Sansretour Marsh in the process.
Reforms.
In the 12th century the region witnessed its first reforms, initiated by Duke Henri III. Admiring distant lands at Lower Alba he tried to civilize the realm, e.g. by changes in the punitive law.
At the middle point of the century the power in the country was consolidated by Duchess Adela Marta. She ordered the renovation of the elven capital palace and moved her seat there, establishing the city of Beauclair. She planted the seeds of chivalric traditions in the Duchy by organising a tourney for her suitors, rewarding the qualities she valued most in men – Strength, Valor and Cunning. On her journey south she met the youngest son of Nilfgaardian Emperor Torres and wed him, creating a bond between Toussaint and the Nilfgaardian Empire.
Carolina Roberta, Ademarta's daughter, continued the reforms. She forbade the use of pointed knives during the feasts, as she found the custom of using them to pick one's teeth barbarous. She was also the one who recognized the cult of Lebioda, brought here by Saint Plegmund.
13th century.
The duchy was ruled by Caroberta's granddaughter Anna Henrietta at least since the 1258 when she married duke Raymund. Despite having a husband it was she who held the greater estime of her subjects. However, since Raymund's death in 1265 Anarietta had been kept unaware of the world's events by her councelors due to her supposed emotional instability and learnt that the Northern War II had broken up only in late 1267 when informed of it by Geralt's hanza. For this treason she imprisoned minister Tremblay in the tower.
In 1275 the Duchy fell under the attack of vampires led by Dettlaff van der Eretein. Depending on certain circumstances the Duchess might have died leading to giving the power in hands of the Regency Council, but it is not certain.
National emblems.
The ducal family coat of arms was the golden grapevine on green field. Two other emblems were used as well, one depicting lions and the other a mounted knight.
&lt;tabber&gt;
Vector renditions="The following illustration has been created by Wiki editors basing on official description and/or depictions."
&lt;/tabber&gt;
Geography and climate.
Toussaint is located between three mountain ranges: Amell, Tir Tochair and Fiery Mountains. The volcanic soil left here by the region's "warm" past allowed the cultivation of grapevine. Another relicts of the yore are now-dry lava tubes which, joint with caves and humanoid-made dungeons, form the duchy's underground system.
Society.
The above-ground part of the region is inhabited predominantly by humans of Nordling origin. Underground parts remained unsearched to at least 13th century and are inhabited by gremlins, kilmulises, korreds, pryskirniks, vampires and a number of species yet unknown to science.
Culture.
"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
Tradition is a holy thing in Toussaint. Holidays, the most important of them being Wine Vat, are keenly observed.
Economy.
In the ancient times the region had a mining industry. Since the middle point of the 12th century however, the major area of the duchy's economy has been wine industry and the closed adits and shafts are being slowly colonized by monsters.

Witchers know hundreds of ways of fighting monsters. When tackling the queen of a kikimore swarm, only one method is effective — run like the wind. This tactic makes it hard to kill the beast, but it does ensure survival, which is a kind of victory.
The Queen cannot be fought properly, as it will inevitably kill Geralt in a single hit since the player is meant to escape, so don't waste time drinking potions for a boss fight. The player must instead run away from the Queen and use the Aard sign to first collapse the passage to slow down the queen and then use it to destroy the supports of the Salamandra Cave, which will bring down the section on top of the Kikimore and cause its death. However, experienced witchers fight the Kikimore Queen using the Brown Oil, Quen, and Aard signs. Bombs like the Devil's Puffball and the Dragon's Dream are also effective as well. Arguably the most easy method is by using Yeden with Cripling Sign unlocked, see The Unforgiven article for details. You can then retrieve the Professor's remains and acquire the Kikimore Queen's nerve that can be used to make the Kikimore's Ire potion.
Be careful when breaking the tunnel supports, standing too close will cause the rocks to collapse on top of you and kill you.
 "Some scientists claim that kikimores behave like ants. They are divided into industrious workers and protective warriors. Life in a kikimore colony is centered around a great, unceasingly procreating female. The landscape around the queen's nest looks like a desert, littered with the remains of unfortunate creatures which unwisely lingered in the area. Not even birdsong can be heard."

File format

There are a number of file formats associated with "The Witcher":
Starting with the .BIF / .KEY file formats you can extract the individual data files from any source in the game. With the .GFF file format you can then read and modify most of those data files, repackaging them when you are done. The creature, conversation, door, encounter, item, merchant (store), place-able, trigger, sound and waypoint documents provide additional details about those specific object types and how to interact with the corresponding .2DA files.
An article dealing with the locations of these files can be found on the Game layout page.
2DA format.
Files with &lt;samp&gt;.2DA&lt;/samp&gt; extensions are two-dimensional arrays, or "tables", or "spreadsheets".
"The Witcher" did not introduce any change here; they are in exactly the same format as they were in NWN or KotOR. This means that you can use any one of the tools already available.
The &lt;samp&gt;2DA&lt;/samp&gt; files are plain text, and the columns are delimited by whitespace characters (e.g. Space and Tab) with small &lt;samp&gt;2DA&lt;/samp&gt; tables a simple text editor will do. For larger tables however, I recommend some more serious tool, like Excel.
The Excel method.
A piece of advice to Excel users: pay attention for the delimiter characters when you import the &lt;samp&gt;2DA&lt;/samp&gt; file into Excel the first time. Excel will detect either Space or Tab as a delimiter, but never both, so you will need to add the other as a delimiter to the import settings; while there, be sure to check the "treat consecutive delimiters as one" option, too. When you have saved your &lt;samp&gt;2DA&lt;/samp&gt; file the first time, remember that the character in the header ("2DA v2.0") must be a Space! If it is a Tab, use Notepad or something to change that back to a space! After you have done this import/save hassle once, you do not need to do this ever again (well, not for the file you have updated, anyway).
A simpler Excel method.
Simply do not save any Excel-specific formatting, use "Save as..." and leave things as Excel "sees" them, i.e. if it thinks it was a text file, then fine... whatever. When the pop-up asking you if you are sure you want to discard any Excel formatting is presented, just do not keep any. You will be asked again when closing the file, just do not and it works just fine.
BIF format.
"For information, see :KEY BIF V1.1 format."
BIK format.
Files with &lt;samp&gt;.BIK&lt;/samp&gt; extensions are BINK movies.
BINK movies are not specific to "The Witcher"; they are found in many modern games. Undoubtedly however, the best quality BINK videos I have seen to date are those in "The Witcher". The movies were created by Tomasz Bagiński, known for his Academy-Award nominated short animation "The Cathedral".
BINK videos can be created and played back using the "Rad Game Tools" — meaning that if you download and install the RAD Game Tools (which are free), you can watch any BINK video simply by double-clicking on it.
DDS format.
Most of the textures in "The Witcher" are in &lt;samp&gt;DDS&lt;/samp&gt; format (or "Direct Draw Surface"). To view them in the Windows Explorer you will need the DDS Thumbnail Viewer from Nvidia. But be aware, this application uses a lot of resources. If you just want to view them in a separate window, download the Windows Texture Viewer.
To edit them, you need some plugins for the following applications:
DLG format.
"For information, see :DLG format."
GFF V3.3 format.
The "Generic File Format" (&lt;samp&gt;GFF&lt;/samp&gt;) is an all-purpose generic format used to store data in BioWare games. It is designed to make it easy to add or remove fields and data structures while still maintaining backward and forward compatibility in reading old or new versions of a file format. It is used in "The Witcher" as well.
Changes from v3.2.
Language IDs: The Language IDs for LocStrings have been changed. The following replaces Table 2.2b in the Bioware GFF Documentation.
"Note:" this table was taken from &lt;samp&gt;languages.2da&lt;/samp&gt; file. LangIDs 17-19, 23-28 are marked as "Reserved".
KEY BIF V1.1 format.
"For information, see :KEY BIF V1.1 format."
LUA format.
Files with &lt;samp&gt;.LUA&lt;/samp&gt; extension are LUA scripts.
&lt;samp&gt;LUA&lt;/samp&gt; scripts are not specific to "The Witcher"; you can find it in several modern games (e.g. in "Far Cry").
&lt;samp&gt;LUA&lt;/samp&gt; files can be created using any text editor. &lt;samp&gt;LUA&lt;/samp&gt; files can be compiled to binary format (see LUC format) using a &lt;samp&gt;LUA&lt;/samp&gt;compiler.
"The Witcher" uses &lt;samp&gt;LUA&lt;/samp&gt; v5.0.3.
LUC format.
Files with &lt;samp&gt;.LUC&lt;/samp&gt; extension are compiled LUA scripts. See &lt;samp&gt;LUA&lt;/samp&gt; script in LUA format.
When LUA files are compiled using a &lt;samp&gt;LUA&lt;/samp&gt; compiler, they become binary files — these binary files are the &lt;samp&gt;LUC&lt;/samp&gt; files you see in "The Witcher".
&lt;samp&gt;LUC&lt;/samp&gt; files can be decompiled. I have used &lt;samp&gt;LUADEC 0.6&lt;/samp&gt; to do the job and I managed to decompile the majority of the &lt;samp&gt;LUC&lt;/samp&gt; files. However, it seems that &lt;samp&gt;LUADEC 0.6&lt;/samp&gt; can not handle some of the &lt;samp&gt;LUC&lt;/samp&gt; files in The Witcher: sometimes it gives an error, sometimes it totally crashes. Looks like an unfinished project — there is a bug report in their tracker about this.
To quickly decompile all &lt;samp&gt;LUC&lt;/samp&gt; files, I have created a batch file containing the following commands — feel free to re-use it(note, how do you use it?):
MAT format.
Files with &lt;samp&gt;.MAT&lt;/samp&gt; extension are materials.
They are written in plaintext, so can opened in any text editor.
NCS format.
Files with &lt;samp&gt;.NCS&lt;/samp&gt; extension are compiled NSS scripts.
When &lt;samp&gt;NSS&lt;/samp&gt; files are compiled using a D'jinni, they become binary files — these binary files are the &lt;samp&gt;NCS&lt;/samp&gt; files you see in "The Witcher".
NSS format.
Files with &lt;samp&gt;.NSS&lt;/samp&gt; extension are NSS (Neverwinter Nights) scripts.
&lt;samp&gt;NSS&lt;/samp&gt; scripts are not specific to "The Witcher"; you can find it in several modern games.
&lt;samp&gt;NSS&lt;/samp&gt; files can be created using any text editor, and can be compiled to binary format (see NCS format) using D'jinni.
QDB format.
QDB files are based on BioWare's Generic File Format (&lt;samp&gt;GFF&lt;/samp&gt;), and it is assumed that the reader of this article is familiar with &lt;samp&gt;GFF&lt;/samp&gt;.
The main structure contains an (unused) "&lt;samp&gt;StoryPhase&lt;/samp&gt;" field of type &lt;samp&gt;CExoString&lt;/samp&gt;, and a "Quest" list of structures, each containing a &lt;samp&gt;CExoString&lt;/samp&gt; which corresponds to a &lt;samp&gt;QST&lt;/samp&gt; file name.
QST format.

Quarter-elf, or the rarely used term quadroon, are terms used on the Continent to refer to one who has a quarter elven blood, being born of one human and one half-elf or two quarter-elves. Only those pickiest about race consider them nonhuman.
In spite of wars, humans and elves formed mixed relations together for centuries, only for humans to condemn them in the 1230s. This resulted in wider persecution and made quarter-elves targets of the same racial slurs as others of Aen Seidhe origin.

Hakland or Haakland is a land located east of the Tir Tochair and Fiery Mountains, beyond Elskerdeg Pass, lying further than Zerrikania, which it borders in the northeast.
History.
Horse warriors from Hakland attacked the Northern Kingdoms sometime before the 13th century.
In 1350, a large-scale Haak Invasion occurred when they raided the North again. Coming through like a storm, they burned, slaughtered, and feasted on the ruins, drinking from the skulls of their fallen enemies for an entire year.
Society and Culture.
Haak people are said to be the finest horsemen in the world, learning the art as babies before they even learn to walk. They are also remarkable archers and combining this with excellence in horsemanship, they become formidable warriors.
Economy.
Exports include smooth silk, sold for large sums in Redania, and aragonite, a rare carbonate mineral only found in Hakland.

Oxenfurt Academy is a renowned higher education facility located in the Redanian city of Oxenfurt. Founded by Nicodemus de Boot, its main academic rival is the Imperial Academy in Nilfgaard.
Among its more famous alumni are Shani and Dandelion. The former went on to become the dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Herbology, while the latter studied the seven liberal arts, graduating with "summa cum laude" honors. Dandelion went on to lecture at the institution many years after his graduation. The witcher Geralt also attended some lectures at the university, such as astronomy.
One of the academy's more notable achievements was the renovated elven aqueduct, which served as an experimental sewage treatment plant, of dubious reputation. The Philosophers' Gate guards the entrance, requiring one to sign into a guest book before entry.

Even though it's one of most dominating sights of the city, the University does not happen to be a place visited in a secondary or main quest. This however changes with the "Hearts of Stone" expansion. Also a number of professors from different faculties make their appearance.
During the course of the Third Northern War the University was closed, and most of its faculty and students conscripted into the ranks of the Redanian Army. Those students and professors involved with the Faculty of Medicine and Herbology were instead 'invited' by King Radovid V to join the medics accompanying the army. The building is protected by witch hunters and soldiers.

Tellico Lunngrevink Letorte, alias "Penstock", but to his friends, Dudu, is a doppler who first appears in the short story "Eternal Flame" in "Sword of Destiny".
In "Eternal Flame", Dudu ultimately faces Geralt by taking on the witcher's own shape. This gives Geralt a very good idea of what fighting himself would be like and it is not at all certain at the outset if the "true witcher" will prevail. It all comes down to a question of conscience.
Dudu appears in final installment of the game trilogy and is sought after by Geralt during his hunt for Cirilla. With a trick and a little help of his friend Priscilla, it's possible to find Dudu during a theatre play in Novigrad.
 "Geralt and I had known the doppler Dudu for years - from before the moment we had actually met him, in fact."
 "You see, we first unwittingly talked to him when he was in Novigrad impersonating another friend of mine, a halfling merchant named Dainty Biberveldt. Dudu had assumed Dainty's form to use the merchant's network of contacts for some business endeavors of his own."
 "Dainty was infuriated at first at his inability to locate the impostor who had inserted himself into his dealings, but when Dudu's investments began generating sizable returns, the halfling changed his tune. He took the doppler on as a partner, introducing him to everyone as his cousin, Dudu Biberveldt."
 "Geralt learned that Dudu had crossed Whoreson Junior, one of Novigrad's most ruthless crime bosses. That Dudu extracted himself from this predicament while only losing one eye should be considered a fortunate turn."
 "Ciri, Dudu and I had all embroiled ourselves in quite the fiasco, but unlike me, the doppler was not caught by the temple guard."
 "Dudu was a theater aficionado and frequent attendee of Irena's [] mummers' performances. Apparently he had even stepped in to replace indisposed mummers on several occasions - and, given his special abilities, proved himself a uniquely convincing understudy."
 "Finally, after a great deal of trouble and thanks to a clever ruse, Geralt was reunited with his old friend - and a certain imprisoned poet's only hope."
 If Geralt chose to kill Whoreson Junior:
 "To end Dudu's story, let me just say that, as usual, he found a way to land on his feet. Dudu disguised himself as his one-time adversary, Whoreson Junior, and took over his business, announcing it was going clean and investing all of its ill-gotten wealth in a legal (and very profitable) overseas trading company."
 "In a way, you could say he was living the "Novigrad dream.""

Kestrel Mountains

The Kestrel Mountains are a range which separates Kaedwen from Redania, Kovir and Poviss; they lie to the west of Kaedwen, also westward, but more north is another mountain range: the Dragon Mountains.
Several rivers run through the range as well, including the Buina, the Braa (which rises between the Kestrel and Dragon mountain ranges) and the Nimnar.
There are three major peaks in the northern part of the range:
The Lutonski road probably runs through the mountains connecting Redania and Kaedwen, at least when weather conditions permit.
In the winter of 1271, Redania's forces crossed the Kestrel Mountains to unite Kaedwen under Redania.

<doc id="7582" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7582" title="Cidaris (city)">
Cidaris (city)

Cidaris is an old seaside city and the capital of the Northern Kingdom of the same name. Built on elven ruins in the 8th century, Cidaris is a cultural center and home to the Cidarian Dynasty.
The city boasts a bustling hub of maritime trade with famous bazaars where, as the adage goes, one can buy anything. Such wealth attracts attention, so a powerful navy stands vigilant.
History.
Foundation.
Satisfied with the surroundings, the Aen Seidhe founded a settlement in this location. Centuries later, in the 760s, the Nordlings landed. Faced with an expansive new foe, the elves decided to retreat further inland and abandoned the settlement.
A human warlord with a small retinue swept in almost immediately, raising his standards atop abandoned towers. That day, on the ruins of ancient buildings, the northern city of Cidaris was born. 
Defending interests.
Given their proximity to Skellige, Cidarian mariners often have to ward off raids. One heroic tale tells of Caroline, a fierce woman whose husband, Geoff of Bremervoord, got killed by Skelligers on a way back from Novigrad. Full of desire for vengeance, Caroline drowned her sword in Skelligan blood and proceeded to claim their ship. Having rallied a crew of sailors and mercenaries, she patrolled the Cidarian waters and hunted daring Islanders.
The end of the 12th century brought the Great Tariff War - meant to tear down the mercantile hegemony of Kovir and Poviss - on Cidaris' doorstep. Its monarch refused to join the blockade, prompting Coram II of Cintra to send warships to bar Kovirian goods from entering the city's port. The effort was doomed from the start, as even Temerian agents helped create gaps in that barricade through bribes. Esteril Thyssen, the Kovirian ruler, ultimately had enough and his fearsome armada annihilated the Cintrans in a series of naval battles.
Heart of a sea power.
Summers herald profit for port cities, but King Mathen's final year suffered a bad one. A colossal kraken appeared in Cidaris, smashing numerous vessels. Not long after, the waves washed up an odd girl named Sha. Superstitious to the core, the king believed she must have been sent by the kraken who would cease with assaults if Prince Ethain married her. A wedding was staged, but the attacks went on. Enraged, Mathen wanted to sacrifice Sha to the kraken but was halted by his son in full armor. As the two argued, the kraken struck again. In the ensuing chaos, Sha threw herself willingly into the water and the kraken vanished in an instant. Alas, the injured king perished in Ethain's arms.
Resurgence of the Cidarian trade happened quite briskly under the new king. The navy wasn't left behind either. Reborn as one of the mightiest on the Continent, it was capable of shielding the Four Kingdoms from the Nilfgaardian Empire. With enlightened Ethain on the throne, many artists flocked to the city.
Geography.
Like many cities in the lush valley of Dol Adalatte, Cidaris lies on the shores of the Great Sea. A road south links it with Kerack. Another important highway leads from Novigrad and Gors Velen, continuing from Cidaris to Verden, Brugge, Cintra and further south.
Economy.
Much like the rest of the kingdom, Cidarians live predominantly from fishing, with another part of revenue coming from its markets, exporting wines, and shipyards. Never the ones to remain pure consumers, Cidarian craftsmen forge kords, their trademark type of sword which enjoys widespread use among sailors.
Locations.
The city is seen as pretty, with its charming streets and white houses adorned with sloping roofs, satin canopies, overhangs, bay windows, galleries and other ornaments. From above, Cidaris resembles an abandoned carcass of a huge whale. Its air smells overwhelmingly of fish and the ornate streets are full of people from the world over. The capital of a kingdom known for good wine, Cidaris has considerable underground to store it.
No place lures as many people to Cidaris as the spacious Seaside Bazaar, celebrated for its rich supply of various goods brought in from across the globe. There's also the Hraki Bazaar for artifacts. The Royal Palace sits right next to the Seaside Bazaar.
In order to carry out exploration plans, defend the markets and make profit in shipbuilding, Cidaris has extensive docks with shipyards launching and overhauling several hundred ships per year. One of the local taverns called "Sonatina" is said to offer unequaled seafood.

Upper Sodden was the southern part of Sodden and was the area south of the Yaruga river between Cintra, Brugge, and Riverdell.
History.
In 1263, the southern part of Sodden was invaded by the Nilfgaardian Army, led by Menno Coehoorn, and its defence was annihilated in a battle resulting in a Nilfgaardian victory.
In the aftermath of the First Northern War, Sodden was split between Nilfgaard and the Northern Kingdoms into Upper Sodden and Lower Sodden, with the Yaruga forming a natural boundary.
After the split, Upper Sodden became a province of Cintra under Nilfgaardian rule, but not everyone was happy and an anti-Nilfgaard group was born in the Slopes. After the Peace of Cintra, it was reunited with Lower Sodden under Temeria.

Sigismund Dijkstra (b. 1219) was the head of Redanian Intelligence. He was a physically imposing man; nearly seven feet tall and bald, with a rather noticeable stomach that was said to give the impression of a scrubbed pig.
Preferring flamboyant clothes with bright colors, he didn't dress the least bit like a spy. However, he was an exceptionally clever man, having studied at Oxenfurt Academy, and was said to be very influential in Redania. While he was referred to as a count in public, this was merely a cover that King Vizimir II ordered him to use so nobody would know that Dijkstra was a mere commoner.
Biography.
Letter to Vizimir.
As a minor spy in the Secret Service's Novigrad cell, Sigismund somehow managed to obtain documents proving Michael de Noailles' incompetence, pertaining to his ignorance of the state being infiltrated by foreign intelligence. In 1248, he wrote a letter to King Vizimir II, addressed "For Your Royal Eyes Only". The king, enraged, ordered to imprison Count de Noailles and elevated Dijkstra to the position of the Royal Security Assignee. In a few years, Dijkstra managed to overhaul the service's structures, replacing moles with faithful men and expanding the area of operations from Kovir to the Nilfgaardian Empire. He then moved his quarters to Oxenfurt, to the rented academy's rooms he called the "Faculty of Most Contemporary History". Around this period, he romanced Philippa Eilhart for three years, who frequently cooperated with the spymaster from then on.
Northern War I.
The biggest challenge Dijkstra faced was the Nilfgaardian Military Intelligence. The web collaborated among state officials and aristocracy, disposing of enormous, hard-to-infiltrate sums of money, barely touched by his agents prior to the First Northern War in 1263. Then, just after reports from Cintra ceased to reach the Oxenfurt quarters, Nilfgaardian agents began unleashing hell throughout Redania. Military warehouses were burned, cavalry horses were poisoned, and many commanders were found dead with knives in their throats. Sigismund Dijkstra, the spymaster, had learnt a hard lesson in humility from his opponent, Vattier de Rideaux.
This startle did not last long as shortly after the initial shock, the service's agents throughout the kingdoms started to take out persons long suspected of collaboration with the Empire. The traitors' blood flowed like rivers, though mistakes were made and certain innocents, especially nonhumans, were killed as well. The few Nilfgaardian informants who managed to avoid Drakenborg fled to Kovir and Hengfors, but even there the knife and the garrote awaited them.
Before Dijkstra could trace the traitors among nobles, however, the war ended, and terms of the truce were required to end the bloodshed. Unable to eliminate the core of the imperial spy web in Redania, he was back near his starting point.
Interwar period.
In 1266, he recruited Dandelion as his informant and asked Yennefer to protect the bard when he was captured by Rience in a town near Bleobheris. The sorceress saved Dandelion and ordered him to hide under Dijkstra's wing. Later, Sigismund managed to calm the tension when Geralt and Olsen killed Temerian agents who, while they were legit agents, had at the time been acting on their own in pursuit of Geralt and Ciri to try and claim Rience's reward for the pair. Together with Philippa, the spymaster asked Dandelion about Geralt's current whereabouts; Dijkstra was surprised when Philippa mentioned Ciri as well, perceiving it as a hasty move.
In late June 1267, he was informed that Emperor Emhyr var Emreis had learnt of the planned Aedirnian and Lyrian staged attack on Glevitzingen, and the Imperial Army now had moved into Dol Angra. After receiving a message from King Demavend III about the attack, he sent word via a royal messenger, Aplegatt, to inform Demavend to not go through with the staged attack as now Nilfgaard knew about their plans. However, he learned too late this message was never delivered as the messenger had been killed in an isolated incident.
Thanedd coup.
On the 30th, he joined Philippa on Thanedd Isle as part of their plan to take out the Nilfgaardian supporters before they could put their own coup in action. At the banquet he talked for some time with Geralt before heading off. The next day, in the early hours just before dawn, he began to help Keira Metz round up the Nilfgaardian supporters with the assistance of his soldiers. As they were arresting Artaud Terranova, Geralt stumbled upon them and Dijkstra had the witcher detained before discussing with the mages on what to do before taking Geralt to Philippa to decide. As he felt Geralt wouldn't cause them too much trouble, Dijkstra didn't bind the witcher, which he would regret later.
On the way, Dijkstra, in his ever sarcastic demeanor, informed Geralt what was going on and asked where Yennefer was. Geralt, not truly understanding the gravity of the situation, told him last he checked she was sound asleep in bed, pissing the spymaster off as the plan had been only for Nilfgaardian supporters to go to bed while the rest made their move (not realizing Yennefer, like many others, had actually remained neutral). After talking with Philippa, she gave Dijkstra part of their deal: a list that'd been on Vilgefortz that had names of Redanians who'd sold out to Nilfgaard. Satisfied with the list, Dijkstra then had Geralt follow him through the towers, intending to head to Loxia as the spymaster knew, despite rumors, Ciri, the sole heir and princess of Cintra, was alive and in the school, but the rectoress would not hand Ciri over to anyone except Geralt.
When it became clear to Geralt that the spymaster planned to use Ciri as a political tool, intending to send her to Redania's capital, Tretogor, the witcher punched the spymaster and Dijkstra, along with the few soldiers he had with him, tried to fight the witcher but were all knocked out. Dijkstra then threatened to get his soldiers from the ship but Geralt, intent on finding Yennefer and Ciri without distractions, summarily broke one of the spymaster's ankles, causing the man to howl and faint from the pain.
First phases of Northern War II.
It was later revealed that the previous night, King Vizimir had been assassinated and, with the start of the Second Northern War, the country was ruled by a Regency Council headed by Dijkstra and Philippa (even though technically Queen Hedwig was supposed to be the ruler). Incensed by the failed coup on Thanedd and how quickly Nilfgaard was taking over other kingdoms, Dijkstra began to hang people left and right in Redania, though he wasn't able to walk for two weeks, and even then required help from Philippa to do so.
A few weeks later, he was informed by Jan Lennep that Geralt was recovering in Brokilon. However, Dijkstra ordered him to leave the witcher alone, though that wasn't to say he forgave the witcher for breaking his ankle, he just didn't have the time and was professional enough to not use his own men to settle a private matter. He then sent out correspondence to Philippa, still intent on finding information that Yennefer had sided with Nilfgaard. He was later visited by the Nilfgaardian ambassador, Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, and the two conversed about politics before turning to what they both really wanted: Dijkstra believed Nilfgaard was hiding Vilgefortz and Yennefer and wanted them, while Shilard believed Redania had Cahir, a Nilfgaardian knight that was wanted for treason. However, neither actually had the people in question and Shilard left, now considered "persona non grata" within the kingdom, his life safe only via diplomatic immunity. Dijkstra then sent another letter to Philippa, piecing together that the earlier news they heard about Nilfgaard having Ciri was false, or rather, a fake Ciri, meaning the real one was still out there somewhere. To confirm these suspicions, he later received important information from a prisoner who was about to be hanged, confirming that it was a fake Ciri.
Still intending to find Vilgefortz, as now Dijkstra and Philippa believed it was likely Ciri was with the rogue sorcerer, the spymaster put Redania's Secret Service to use and found two of Vilgefortz's hangouts, but no sorcerer or Ciri. However, they did find evidence that Vilgefortz had been experimenting on pregnant women, killing them in the process.
Late autumn armistice.
Later, in late October, he made his way to Lan Exeter, the winter capital of Kovir and Poviss, to try and ask for a loan of a million bizants to raise an army in time for spring, when Nilfgaard would start up its assault on the North once more. However, Kovir's king, Esterad Thyssen, refused on the grounds of the kingdom's neutrality and an old agreement that meant he couldn't back Nilfgaard's enemies. Despite this, the king's wife, Zuleyka, gave him advice that showed him a loophole and was thus able to supply the spymaster indirectly. Dijkstra, having struck up an unlikely friendship with Esterad, ended up staying a little bit longer and the two had philosophical debates. On their last conversation before Dijkstra left, Esterad warned the spymaster to stop all the bloodshed in Redania, as it'd bring nothing but assassins after him sooner or later.
It's good to have fanatics and sorceress-scarers on one's side ... if we need to unleash them against the sorceresses or Nilfgaard, we'll just whistle. They will not be far — just beyond the border.- Dijkstra to Ori Reuven,  as reported in "Shadow People, or the story of His Majesty's Secret Service"
Following the meeting with Esterad, Sigismund had growing suspicion towards Eilhart and her close circle of sorceresses at Montecalvo During the autumn and winter, apart from preparations to raise troops and in secret from Philippa, Dijkstra and his personal assistant Ori Reuven aided Jacques de Aldersberg in his mission to reform Order of the White Rose into Order of the Flaming Rose with aim to balance the rising position of sorceresses and aid the forces fighting Nilfgaard with a strong knightly order. Dijkstra was aware of the dangers that hosting the Order in Redania might bring, thus ensuring that its headquarters would lie south to the Pontar, in Temeria. It was also apparently during this period when he, under the alias of Sigi Reuven, co-founded the Syndicate, an underground alliance of criminal bosses and church officials that was to end the period of instability in Novigrad streets. Taking information out of drunken Walter Veritas, he was able to capture and eliminate the Nilfgaardian agent Doadrick Leumaerts and later recruited Walter to the Syndicate.
In January 1268, Dijkstra received a letter from Geralt, informing him that Vilgefortz's hideout was located in Stygga Castle, Ebbing. Unable to operate that far south of the Yaruga, he traded this information to Vattier de Rideaux in exchange for details on Vizimir's assassination learned by Nilfgaardian Intelligence.
Peace of Cintra.
As the de factor ruler of Redania, Queen Hedwig, was still indisposed, Dijkstra joined the other kingdoms' rulers in Cintra to discuss the peace terms in April 1268. However, due to being a non-royal, many of the rulers scoffed at him being there and the Hierarch, Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart, even noted to himself that they must do away with the spy. After peace was officially declared, a celebration was held in Novigrad and the spy informed Philippa that he'd learned the half-elf that assassinated Vizimir hadn't been acting alone. Sometime later, he walked through Tretogor Castle one last time, saying goodbye to his personal assistant, Ori Reuven, noting that he'd said one word too many to one person too many but, having been tipped off by Vattier de Rideaux and Emhyr var Emreis, knew assassins sent by Philippa were coming for him, and fled the country.
He later appeared in Elskerdeg Pass and met Isengrim Faoiltiarna and Boreas Mun, two fugitives on the run for their own reasons. An unlikely party, the three agreed to travel east together, to Zerrikania or Hakland, with Dijkstra taking on the name Sigi Reuven once again.
Return in the North.
Sometime later Dijkstra, still using the alias Sigi Reuven, returned to the Northern Kingdoms accompanied by Isengrim and Bart. He went to Oxenfurt in order to help his daughter Iriana. To accomplish this task he enlisted the help of Dandelion who was a professor there at the time. While Dandelion, with the help of Bart and Isengrim, helped out Iriana, Dijkstra hid in an old safehouse of his. The former home of Count van Troffke, who Dijkstra had arrested for high treason but later offered a deal: exile instead of execution. When Iriana and Dandelion came to him for help he provided them with old documents of the Redanian intelligence. Later he gave his daughter the key to her old house and to help her look for Count van Troffke as a way to make amends. He then went to Novigrad where he bought a bathhouse and completed the Syndicate's code of conduct. In 1272 he and three other most influential gang leaders were known as the Big Four.
After the outbreak of the Third Northern War, Dijkstra, not approving of how Radovid was "destroying" everything his father, Vizimir II, had built up, began to work with the Temerian loyalists Vernon Roche, Ves, and Thaler, in their plan to assassinate King Radovid V and make Temeria a vassal state to Nilfgaard while allowing the rest of the North to be swallowed up by the empire.
"If Geralt doesn't complete Reason of State quest (default):" The assassination however was never carried out, thus allowing King Radovid to win the war against Nilfgaard and gather again the Northern Kingdoms under the silver eagle blazon. Dijkstra's fate remained unknown.
"If Geralt completes Reason of State quest:" The assassination was successful but, having despised surrendering Redania in favor of Temeria's semi-independence, the former head spy turned on the Temerians and planned to kill them, as he knew they wouldn't go along with his plans.
"If Geralt defends the Temerians:" Dijkstra underestimated Geralt's resolve to remain neutral though, and in turn Dijkstra was summarily killed.
"If Geralt doesn't defend the Temerians:" After Roche and the others were all killed, Dijkstra took over Redania, becoming the Chancellor of the country and brought in a new era of manufacturing to the region.
"Something Ends, Something Begins".
Around late 1270s, King Sigismund refused to attend the wedding of Geralt and Yennefer but sent Sir Matholm as his royal envoy.
Note that the story is non-canon and written before the Saga. Characters here who would later debut in the novels should be viewed as initial prototypes rather than Sapkowski's intentions of how their future would look like.
E3 Demo (2014).
In an E3 demo of "The Witcher 3", he was shown to be back in the Northern Kingdoms, having contracted Geralt to hunt down a griffin in Novigrad. In exchange, he would find the whereabouts of an ashen-haired lass. After Geralt returned successfully with the griffin's head, Dijkstra reveals that Ciri was spotted in Velen in the company of a childlike creature named Johnny. He then asked Geralt if the girl is who he thought she was, but the witcher simply doesn't answer and thanks him for the information as he departs his company.
The E3 quest is absent in the full-release version of "The Witcher 3".
In "The Witcher 3", Geralt meets the spymaster once more. After his return in the Northern Kingdoms, Dijkstra moved to Novigrad where he apparently approached the criminal underworld of the city, becoming one of the most noted four criminal lords.
"The individual masquerading as Sigi Reuven was in fact none other than Sigismund Dijkstra, the former head of Redanian intelligence and a man Geralt and I had had many dealings with in the past."
"He had fallen out of King Radovid's favor and nothing had been heard of him for many years. Now it seemed he had finally decided to emerge from the shadows, but instead of returning to high political wrangling he dove deep into the criminal underground – and quickly surfaced as one of its leading figures."
"Though he did not show it, in his own way Dijkstra respected Geralt – even though the very thought of their last meeting brought a pained grimace to his face. The two had found themselves standing in each other's way during the coup on Thanedd Island. The stalemate was quickly broken when Geralt summarily broke Dijkstra's leg."
"This spy's life story would make for a postively enthralling adventure tale. A victim of Philippa Eilhart's intrigues, he had been forced to flee Redania at breakneck speed – or have his own neck broken by assassins. For a certain time he sought refuge in far-off lands, but in the end he decided to return to the Free City of Novigrad."
"Well aware of Geralt's extraordinary talents, Dijkstra asked him to help find his stolen treasure. Though Geralt knew the identity of the criminal mastermind responsible, he decided not to divulge this information and set about investigating as if the case were a complete mystery."
"Though the witcher's lips remained tightly sealed regarding my role in the treasure heist, Dijkstra still sniffed out his dishonesty – and made it clear how much he disliked being played for a fool."
"Though Dijkstra did not aid the persecuted mages out of the goodness of his heart, Triss appreciated his support all the same, for it proved vital to the endeavor's success."
"Dijkstra opposed the mage hunts sweeping the city, but for Philippa Eilhart he was willing to make an exception. He had never forgiven his one-time friend for betraying and then trying to kill him. Unfortunately, Geralt needed Philippa alive - and knew how to free her."
"Though Dijkstra craved vengeance, he was willing to resign from his plans in return for valuable information."
"Anyone who thought Dijkstra had broken all ties with the world of political schemers and plotters was sorely mistaken. His great comeback was to be a patriotic act that would free Redania from the rule of a madman – the assassination of King Radovid."
If Reason of State is completed:
...and Geralt intervenes:
"As an experience dragonslayer once commented, more than once heads have only rolled after the dragon's been slain, the mead broken out and the campfire lit, for when it comes time to share the treasure, hunters of beasts often become slayers of men instead. Such was the case after the assassination of Radovid, when Dijkstra tried to renege on the terms of their arrangement and do away with Thaler and Vernon."
"Dijkstra counted on Geralt maintaining witcher neutrality in this matter - a miscalculation which cost him his life."
...and Geralt does not intervene:
"As an experience dragonslayer once commented, more than once heads have only rolled after the dragon's been slain, the mead broken out and the campfire lit, for when it comes time to share the treasure, hunters of beasts often become slayers of men instead. Such was the case after the assassination of Radovid, when Dijkstra tried to renege on the terms of their arrangement and do away with his allies, who wanted to negotiate with Nilfgaard."
"With this move the former spy achieved his goal, fortifying himself in a position that allowed him to continue the war against Nilfgaard."
"Sigismund Dijkstra, better known simply as Dijkstra, is a master spy and head of special forces for the kingdom of Redania, a wealthy country located in the North. Extremely tall, balding, and big boned, the man could be easily mistaken for one of those wealthy royal entourage types who do nothing but roam around courts with a glass of wine, oblivious to the brutal political dynamics playing out in the background. Like any spy, Sigismund won't hesitate to use any manner of dirty trick to achieve his goals or forward his agendas. Dijkstra is known to dislike Geralt of Rivia: the men crossed paths in the past and, as a result of that encounter, the former ended up temporarily crippled, which—combined with the witcher besting the spy—added injury to insult. However, Geralt and Dijkstra, cold professionals both, also harbor respect for each other's achievements in their respective fields of work."
"Chest 1: Sigismund Dijkstra was man of razor-sharp intellect and great ambition who arose from common origins to become the head of Redanian Intelligence. Alas, betrayal later forced his retreat from the Regency Council and the kingdom. This setback, however, merely served to open another door for one as shrewd and enterprising as he. Seeing the great potential in Novigrad's criminal underworld, he entrenched himself under the alias Sigi Reuven and quickly garnered tremendous influence. And it was he who introduced to the Free City's underbelly a code of conduct – an arrangement to be used to his benefit whenever the opportunity presented itself."

Demavend III, also spelled Demawend or in Elder Speech Demaewn, was the son of Virfuril who succeeded his father as the 16th King of Aedirn. He had one legitimate son and heir, Stennis.
Much of his reign was marked by a centuries-old dispute with Kaedwen, ruled at the time by King Henselt, over the fertile land of Upper Aedirn. Apart from that, Demavend fought in both the First and Second Northern Wars against the invading Nilfgaardian Empire. After the second war, he was one of the negotiators of the peace treaty.
Demavend wasn't very trustful of mages, calling them "devious old windbags", and preferred royal messengers for communication. He nonetheless had Radcliffe of Oxenfurt as an advisor and informant, and also called Yennefer for help from time to time.
Biography.
Childhood.
At some point in 1226, agents of the Temerian Secret Service who infiltrated Aedirnian Special Forces stationed in Aldersberg, made an attempt on the life of underage Prince Demavend, an act meant to be Medell's revenge for the shameful defeat Virfuril handed him near Hagge. Although it was unsuccessful, Virfuril flew into a rage and executed an entire third of the special forces including the Commissar Vilmerik Moebius.
First Northern War and after.
In 1263, upon learning about the atrocities perpetrated by the Black Forces in Cintra, Demavend joined the rest of the Four Kingdoms with his army to avenge Calanthe and drive the invaders back. Led by Vizimir II of Redania, the united forces of the North managed to defeat Nilfgaard in the battle of Sodden Hill. A truce was negotiated shortly after the battle, which Demavend signed.
This concord among the North's great powers disappeared just as soon as Nilfgaard retreated. Demavend and Henselt renewed their quarrel over the Upper Aedirn which, however, they stopped in spring 1267 when Demavend summoned Henselt along with Vizimir II, Foltest of Temeria and his staunchest ally Meve of Lyria and Rivia to Hagge.
Meeting at Hagge.
In the beginning, Demavend corrected Henselt it wouldn't be sergeants but young officers who were going to lead Nilfgaard's armies in wars to come, following Emhyr var Emreis' military purges. Later, when they discussed the spreading of a pro-Nilfgaard prophecy in the North, Demavend revealed he once had a cleric tortured to find out how much Emhyr paid him but the cleric expired before revealing a thing. This prompted Vizimir II to warn him against such methods to avoid making martyrs. He also eagerly agreed with a major campaign to root out Scoia'tael and momentarily considered a punitive expedition to Dol Blathanna.
As the monarchs agreed Cintra should be conquered back, Demavend proposed for it to be a joint protectorate but was persuaded it should be a free country once more. He quickly guessed that the mysterious force searching for the lost heir of Cintra, Ciri, was Emhyr who wanted her to legalize his conquest. Another proposition he came up with afterward was a morganatic marriage of Ciri to Vissegerd as a puppet king, but this was turned down by others present. In order to get ahead of Emhyr, the kings eventually silently agreed that the Cintran heir had to die.
Second Northern War.
Right after the summit, Demavend began the war preparations. He launched a large-scale persecution of nonhumans and an offensive against the Scoia'tael simultaneously with Henselt, in order to clear the rear before striking Nilfgaard. Teaming up with Meve, Demavend redistributed around third of his men into forts along the southern frontier, as close to the enemy as possible. The plan was to provoke Nilfgaardian rangers stationed in Dol Angra to attack Lyrians or Aedirnians who could then call it a "casus belli", cross Yaruga in full force and call others for help.
By June 1267, Demavend began to send messengers to Foltest and Vizimir II, informing them soldiers disguised as Nilfgaardians were ready for July 2nd night. Foltest replied first, asking Demavend to withhold until the mages' assembly was over. Vizimir then wanted the same, adding what the Redanian Secret Service found out – that there had been a betrayal, Emhyr knew about the plan and moved a massive army under Menno Coehoorn to Dol Angra. Alas, the reply never reached Demavend as the messenger was shot by Yaevinn in the woods of the Pontar Valley.
Defeat and elopement abroad.
On a night from 1 to 2 July, Nilfgaardian force disguised as Lyrians and Aedirnians seized Glevitzingen, an Imperial border post. Mere moments after, a group of Demavend's heralds escorted by Lyrian soldiers – all of whom were quite possibly still disguised Black Ones – informed the folk of the surrounding villages that Aedirn was taking control now. Claiming this an act of aggression, the Imperials crossed the Yaruga immediately, conquering the Lyrian border fortresses Scala and Spalla in just three days. Rivia was prepared for months of siege but capitulated under the promise of no harm. As Nilfgaard captured her realm, Meve retreated to Aedirn, seeking aid.
When she found him, they united forces, amounting to around 5-6,000 men, including no more than 1,200 knights. Coehoorn then marched his remaining 13,000 men to the foot of the city gates, and a large scale battle took place, resulting in a Northern defeat and the loss of the city.
Unbeknownst to most, he was carrying out an affair with a local prostitute Demaretta which resulted in an illegitimate son named Baldwin. Demavend and his forces fell back to the Old City where the prostitute was going into labor. With Meve and the remnant of her army, they held out until Demavend's child was born, retreating from the city right after. When the battle ended, Demavend gave Meve a few of his men to help her in a guerilla war and then bid her farewell.
Seeing his army annihilated, the kingdom in ashes and betrayal from Henselt who struck a deal with Nilfgaard and robbed him of Upper Aedirn, Demavend sought asylum in Tretogor, where the Regency Council hosted him. When Nilfgaard reached the defenseless Vengerberg they had no mercy, burning it entirely to the ground.
Restoring Aedirn.
Demavend did not waste time in Redania but worked hard to gather as many soldiers as possible to reclaim his dominion. When in March 1268 the decisive battle of Brenna commenced, Demavend sent some of his units in support. As the battle turned victorious for the north, Demavend and Henselt met on Aedirnian soil, shook hands and agreed to advance against Ardal aep Dahy, the commander of Nilfgaardian East Army Group, together. Strengthened by Redanian reinforcements and Meve's guerillas, who had cruelly sacked Nilfgaard's rear, the allied kings not only stopped Ardal's advance but drove him all the way to Aldersberg. Without any delay, Demavend and Henselt routed his army in a final battle and won, despite Nilfgaard having a significant numerical advantage.
Since Foltest had similar success with driving Nilfgaard south past Angren, Nilfgaard started to sue for peace. Meeting at the end of the March in Cintra, the Northern kings negotiated with Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen who represented the Emperor. To avoid unwanted complications with Nilfgaard and unnecessary bloodshed, Demavend agreed to accept Dol Blathanna as an autonomous elven duchy. Aedirnian control of Hagge, occupied by Foltest for safety reasons since late July last year, was also restored. Only Henselt refused to return Upper Aedirn as he claimed it was an ethnic territory of Kaedwen. In the end, his court sorcerer Sabrina Glevissig pressed him into withdrawing from conquered castles in less than a week. The treaty's final version was signed on 2 April.
To celebrate the end of the war, a great celebration was held in Novigrad which Demavend attended.
Continuing conflict over Upper Aedirn.
It took but one year before the Kaedwenian Army attempted to retake the Upper Aedirn. They crossed Pontar on a third day after the Velen equinox without any formal declaration of war to have an element of surprise. Demavend, however, had good spies, so he was ready for them. He lined up his troops consisting of banners from Vengerberg, Aldersberg, Gulet and a dwarven regiment from Vergen along the hills near and gave their command to his champion Seltkirk who was a great inspiration to fighting Aedirnians. They numbered more than 5,000.
As the battle started, Aedirnians quickly decimated the Dun Banner and wreaked havoc among the Kaedwenians but the battle later turned into a veritable hell after Sabrina Glevissig conjured Melgar's Fire, killing Aedirnians and Kaedwenians alike. Henselt then ordered Sabrina to be burned alive at the stake and retreated back to his kingdom.
Death.
In 1271, while out on one of his ships celebrating with various entertainment, the witcher Letho secretly boarded and, using a Northern Wind-based special capsule, froze the majority of the ship and its people in place, though a mage on board managed to protect the king and a few other guards. However, none of them could best the witcher, who proceeded to cut them all down before grabbing Demavend and killing him, then cut off his head as proof.
Physical appearance.
Despite apparently having a belly large enough to hold a tankard full of beer while he was sprawled in his armchair, Demavend was still considered a handsome man by 1268.
He was especially attractive in his younger years and it was said that Foltest himself would've envied his eagle-like profile with piercing emerald-green eyes. Demavend also had a rather lustrous mane that, to his great sorrow, receded quickly with age. To hide this he often wore a white cap embroidered with golden thread.
Appearance and personality.
Demavend was intelligent, well-educated and knowledgeable about tactics. This is best evidenced by how he was able to predict Emhyr's moves during the Northern Wars. A shrewd, farseeing politician, he knew precisely what to do to ensure the integrity of his realm. One of his other characteristic traits was self-control. Demavend was able to maintain calm façade even when arguing with impulsive people like Henselt. Only his face betrayed how much effort he put into not losing composure.
He was cruel at times, ordering priests whose preachings interfered with his politics to be tortured to death. His hatred for elves was legendary and he went as far as launching a large persecution of nonhumans that resulted in many a pogrom. What's more, Demavend offered 50 ducats for every Scoia'tael head, even in a time when the royal treasury was nearly drained by the war with Nilfgaard. It must be said, though, that he didn't hate the nonhumans blindly. He had good relations with dwarves of Mahakam and eventually allowed Dol Blathanna to be an autonomous elven duchy.
"Demavend, son of Virfuril, ruled the Kingdom of Aedirn, which was mightily aggrieved during the last war with Nilfgaard. A proponent of authoritarian rule, he was seen as having no love for nonhumans. He often moved radically against the Scoia'tael, though he drooled in spite of himself when the guerrillas perpetrated massacres on his own people, as these justified the punitive expeditions he delighted in sending into the foothills of Dol Blathanna. He also showed no shyness towards imprisoning and torturing rabble-rousers and street prophets who would interfere in his politics. Thus it is no wonder that many could not wait to see him dead. In spite of this, his subjects could not help but be surprised by his death, for it is not every day that a crowned head paints the palace floor with its blood."
Journal entry.
Demavend is a leader in the Homecoming version.
"Scroll 1: Demavend possessed many traits that predisposed the king for greatness. Well-educated, shrewd, cunning, a master of political intrigue. Unfortunately, he was also very, very impatient."
"Scroll 2: King Demavend was never satisfied with the present. He always looked to tomorrow, to the great feats of his future, shrugging off the mundane tasks of the court. Whilst his advisers bored him with the nuances of prudent fiscal policy, he quietly planned his next conquest..."
"Scroll 3: Aedirn's neighbors learned quickly that Demavend could never be appeased with compromise. His kingdom expanded like dough baked in too small a bread pan, pushing and stretching in all directions. Not unlike the Nilfgaardian Empire..."
"Scroll 4: When Nilfgaardian forces eventually crossed the Yaruga, a panicked fear struck deeply in all the rulers of the North. All except for King Demavend, that is. He rejoiced, for at last he would face an enemy worthy of Aedirn's might! Of course... His jubilation would not last long."
"Chest 1: Although all now are too young to recall, Demavend was once a strapping young man. Foltest himself would have envied the man's eagle-like profile. Maidens swooned when caught under the gaze of his piercing emerald eyes. But years of plenty have taken their toll. A plump belly and rosy cheeks show clearly that the king was never want for sumptuous food and drink. His saggy neck and hunched shoulders proved further that he preferred to command his armies from a silk-lined throne in place of a saddle..."
"Chest 2: Demavend's hatred for elves was legendary. While Vizimir and Foltest fought the Squirrels out of necessity, the King of Aedirn hunted the rebels down with astonishing enthusiasm. Despite the fact that the war with Nilfgaard had nearly drained Aedirn's royal treasury, Demavend offered 50 ducats for every Scoia'tael head. Taking advantage of the lucrative bounty, Aedirnians often falsely accused and captured innocent elves and dwarves. Demavend was perfectly aware his subjects were exploiting the offer. And yet, he didn't seem bothered in the least..."
"Chest 3: Under his crown, Demavend always wore a white cap embroidered with gold thread – undeterred even by the sweltering summer months. Why? It seems the vain king was ashamed of his retreating hairline. Many alchemists and barbers passed through his court, offering promises to restore the Aedirnian ruler's lustrous mane. Each of them, to the last, spent their remaining days in the Aldersberg dungeons for their failure – deprived of freedom... and their own scalps."

A Grigg, or Imp, is a tiny humanoid known on both sides of the Yaruga as a mischievous but harmless being found in the countryside, forests, and, at times, in underground crypts.
Culture.
The griggs of Murky Waters appear to be divided into two tribes: the so-called "good" tribe and a "bad" tribe. The good tribe inhabits the area between a local bridge to the fields and the riverbank, while the "bad" tribe has taken up residence in one of the deeper chambers of the crypt in the fields.
They seem to worship or revere santons, which they treat as chapels and hide their precious cat harnesses in. Another important symbol, standing for joy and friendship, is four-leaf clover – a man who carries it is uninterrupted by griggs during his or her work. Once upon a time, priests from the Old Erem tried to convert some forest imps, reportedly with little success. A term "pagan imp" is nowadays used by the clergy.
Characteristics.
Appearance.
Griggs are quite possibly the smallest of the recognized races. When standing next to a human they reach to his knee at best and due to this, an unruly child is sometimes called a "foolish imp". Since the height would never allow them to sit on a horse, they mount cats.
A grigg is usually fat, has a broad nose and pointed ears and very much likes to wear some sort of hat.
Personality.
Griggs are vivid and joyful and despite being rather mischievous at all time, pissing in milk, tangling horse manes and exhibiting a marked appreciation for alcohol, they hardly injure someone permanently and tend to not be vicious.

Pat was the son of the village mason, Harn.
Biography.
Geralt met the boy one day near the village of Murky Waters and learned he was an avid archer. He was trying to help his father repair the ruined bridge, but he would much rather have been adventuring.
Geralt could choose to have the boy accompany him while he is in the area as one possible reward for completing the quest Small Problems. As an archer, Pat was quite competent. His vitality, on the other hand, was considerably low.

The blacksmith in Murky Waters does not live alone, nor is he the only merchant. He and his wife have a son who also trades in weapons, armor and related products as part of the family business. The boy does not seem really into doing it, but he has to obey his father's wishes, apparently "or else!". The lad can be found next to the his father's shop, looking forlorn. Like most teenagers, he seems to get up relatively late as well.
His attitude toward being a merchant is quite ironic as his inventory is easily the most lucrative in the entire game. Not only is he the first merchant who sells the mighty Perun runestone, which is the most powerful temporary weapon augmentation in the game, but he is also the only one who sells Gwalhir, which is the 2nd best steel sword in the game.

The blacksmith's wife is the only member of the Murky Waters family who is not a merchant. Running the household and dealing with a moody teenager is plenty to keep her busy, or so it would seem. She does, however, have the time to muse about her husband's activities when he is not at home or working.
She is very friendly and apparently a very good cook. She gives Geralt the Temptation quest. Her husband is carrying on with a succubus and she would like an end to it. She offers a book of herbal lore as the reward, but as Geralt leaves her hut, he is immediately intercepted by her husband, who knows what she is up to. He makes Geralt a counter-offer. Decisions, decisions...

The elven craftsman was part of Toruviel's band of starving elves who camped in the cave by the Lakeside in Murky Waters. He was looking for four pieces of centipede armor for his work and was willing to pay. He was also a master craftsman, though the term slightly offended his artistic nature, and was capable of doing many things: mirror reassembly being one such skill.
He was well versed in the history of Raven's armor.

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The Field hospital is in the center of Old Vizima. It is where Shani has chosen to set up her emergency medical post to tend to the casualties, be they human or non-human, of the fighting between the Order and the Scoia'tael. As a result, it is also the scene of at least one unexpected, armed intrusion.
It is also the location of the only notice board in Old Vizima and the place where the sexual encounter with the two nurses takes place, depending on previous path choices. Also dependent on those choices is which door Geralt gets to use to enter the hospital. If he chooses the Order or the Scoia'tael, he gets to use the front door, but on the neutral path he must use the back door. An interesting side-effect of this slight difference is that it makes the notice board somewhat difficult to get to if you choose the neutral path.
