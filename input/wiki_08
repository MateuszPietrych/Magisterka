Nycklar was the son of the coffinmaker in Jealousy and witnessed the fight between Leo Bonhart and the Rats, where all of them save for Falka were killed and beheaded by Bonhart. Later, he and Goulue gave the Rats a decent burial.
Biography.
Nycklar was standing around when Bonhart went back into the inn before asking if anyone fancied a horse and some money and Nycklar eagerly stepped forward. Bonhart then gave him orders to ride to Claremont to deliver a letter to the bounty hunter's cousin, Houvenaghel, and then to deliver a letter to Esterhazy in Fano. Nycklar, who'd been eyeing Falka's horse, Kelpie, was quickly told he couldn't choose that one so the boy chose another Rats' horse instead. However, before he took off, he stayed around and saw Falka naked, having been forced to strip down so Bonhart could make sure she wasn't hiding any magical charms before re-dressing. Bonhart, on seeing Nycklar still there, threatened to cut him up if he failed his task and so Nycklar took off to deliver the letters.
After he delivered the letters though, instead of heading straight home he headed to Malhoun, showing off his mount and spending his money on drinks while telling everyone what happened in Jealousy, exaggerating it more and more as the drinks continued. Stefan Skellen, the Imperial Coroner of the Nilfgaardian Empire, who was looking for Bonhart and Ciri, sent some members of his unit to capture Nycklar and bringing him to Rocayne in order to interrogate him, who told him the truth and about the letters, though he didn't quite know their contents. After the interrogation, Stefan Skellen released him and sent some of his men to Claremont and to Fano to investigate on the letters of the bounty hunter.
Afterwards, he made it back home to Jealousy but was plagued by nightmares until he gave the Rats a decent burial in the town's graveyard. He later joined the army but never returned, making many back home believe that he'd fallen in battle.

Joanna Selborne

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Joanna Selborne, known as "Kenna" was a psionic, which is to say that she was capable of telepathy and tele-empathy, and under hypnosis was also capable of precognition. While she could also give orders via thoughts, she could only communicate via telepathy with mages, elves, and other psionics.
Reportedly, she had a hand in the disappearance of a ship, "The Southern Star", but nothing could be proven to pin it on her.
Biography.
Sometime in August 1267, she'd been in Etolia when Dacre Silifant approached her to join a hanza under Stefan Skellen and she accepted and the following month, on September 14, she met Skellen for the first time at Fort Rocayne.
Two days later, after Skellen learned that Leo Bonhart had sent letters to two locations, he sent Kenna with one group to talk to the recipient in Fano, a swordsmith named Esterhazy. Having prepared plans that the man would be stubborn and refuse to tell them why Bonhart contacted him, Kenna probed his mind and commanded him to tell them everything. He informed them Bonhart had dropped by on the 12th with Falka and Esterhazy had given the latter a gnomish gwyhyr. However, no sooner had they left the group was approached by another member of the hanza, Ola Harsheim, demanding they make haste for the other location, Claremont, as a massacre had happened there yesterday.
They arrived too late in Claremont, as Bonhart had already left with Falka. As none of the gang was having any luck getting useful information from anyone in town, they left. However, Kenna sensed they'd picked up an invisible spy here after noting a few peculiarities, though she couldn't always sense the person. After confirming it, she brought this to Skellen's attention and asked him to stop in a village the next day and she'd use the "pancake method" to reveal the invisible spy. The next day, on September 23, the gang gathered in Unicorn under the guise of news directly from the emperor and Kenna gave the signal and several of them threw milk and flour at the target area, revealing the mage Rience. They quickly bound him but before Skellen could so much as touch him with a hot iron, Rience revealed he was merely trying to get ahead of the group to get Ciri, as his master, Vilgefortz, needed to extract the girl's womb. Before more could be said though, the group was interrupted by Bonhart, who'd just showed up with Falka, who he now knew to be Ciri, the lost princess of Cintra.
With this turn of events, all the gang was sent out while Skellen, Bonhart, and Rience talked. However, Kenna, having caught a terrible thought from Rience while she'd been prying his mind, realized the conundrum she was in and offered to stand guard over Ciri outside along with Neratin Ceka, who she now knew to be a traitor, spying on Skellen for Vattier de Rideaux. While she told Ceka she wouldn't say anything, she also refused to help him and approached Ciri to try and understand why there was so much fuss over this one teenager. Kenna probed Ciri's mind but Ciri's power easily pushed the psionic's out, knocking Kenna off her feet and causing a massive nosebleed in the process. In the confusion, the other guards were killed, Ceka helped free Ciri, and the young girl rode off and escaped the gang and their leaders, all the while Kenna couldn't even get herself to stand up from the dizziness.
She eventually recovered and stayed in the now slightly smaller gang, trying to locate Ciri in the forests and lands around Unicorn. Eventually, thanks to Vilgefortz communicating with Rience, they found Ciri's trail at the beginning of November and began to pursue her all the way to Mil Trachta. Realizing the girl hoped to escape them using a portal within the mythical Tor Zireael, Skellen pushed the gang to follow. Kenna, however, had become fed up with the deception and, along with several others, left the gang just as they reached Tarn Mira, despite knowing she might be killed anyways by Nilfgaard for her role in the gang.
Giving testimony.
A year later, in September 1268, she was held at the Citadel in Nilfgaard to give testimony and be sentenced for everything that occurred last year. Initially, her sole cellmate, Kohut, (thanks to a past emperor taking equality of the sexes literally to mean making all military prisons have unisex cells) tried to rape her but he quickly realized he'd tried it against the wrong person, as the psionic not only caused him great pain but made him also headbutt a guard, resulting in being further disciplined. The two were joined the next day by the Scarra sisters, who were friendly enough to Kenna. Kenna eventually gave testimony during a tribunal against Stefan Skellen and his gang leaders, recounting everything that'd transpired. Just as the judge was getting ready to have her sent back to her jail cell to await sentencing, she used her abilities to make the judge release her instead.

The Black Book of Ellander

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
The Black Book of Ellander is a literary tract of unknown authorship that focused on telling the story of Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer. However, it's not a very popular book regarding the legend as it was "brutally authentic", likely to mean it told the truth: that nearly everyone in Geralt's company perished in battle and the witcher several months later during the Rivian Pogrom. It's also the only surviving story that accurately named the location of the final battle between Geralt and Vilgefortz as Stygga Castle, rather than Rhys-Rhun Castle.

Silver holds a special place among metals in the witcher universe. In particular, weapons and other items made of silver repel almost all magical beasts as they have a sensitivity to the metal. It is mined in Kovir and Poviss and is the basis for many currencies.

Kolda

Kolda was a human havekar (hawker) who dealt in equipment with the Scoia'tael during the Second Northern War.
Biography.
On the 6th or 7th of August 1267, while his group was transporting the self-surrendered Cahir aep Ceallach to Nilfgaardian agents at Seventh Mile in Brokilon, he came across Geralt of Rivia and Dandelion. Initially believing they were elves come to trade due to the Brokilonian garments still worn by the witcher and bard, the hawkers quickly realised the two weren't going to buy anything and went to end the deal. As the pair went to leave, the imperials arrived and quickly betrayed and murdered the hawkers - first the boss was killed by the Nilfgaardian commander, then Kolda was garrotted and stabbed by the other agents.

A sea witch or marine sorceress (Polish: "morszczynka") are term used to refer members of an intelligent sea race forming an underwater society together with nereids and merpeople.
Characteristics.
"Fucusyas" seem to fill a role analogous to Nordling and Nilfgaardian magic users. These marine sorceresses are highly esteemed by other inhabitants of the sea and are reportedly more skilled than human mages in terms of mutating or transforming living creatures: they can change a human into mereperson or otherwise without a pain which would occur when a human mage does a similar attempt.

Biography.
Thanedd Coup.
At the end of June 1267, Voymir and his unit travelled to Thanedd Island with Dijkstra, in order to help arrest those mages suspected of allying with Nilfgaard. This so called Thanedd coup was successful, and Voymir was able to then sneak his unit out of Aretuza and down to the docks, where they boarded the "Spada" and left Temeria to go back to Tretogor.

Verden Insurrection

The Verden Insurrection, as the name suggests, began in Verden in 1267 after the Nilfgaardian invasion and subjugation of the kingdom under Ervyll. At first, the insurrection counted only about five hundred people in its ranks; those outraged by the brutality of the Verden Operations Group as they invaded. They were not only cruel in battle, but inflicted the same wanton cruelty on the general population as well.
Initially Ervyll put up some token resistance (but this only prompted further bloodshed), and he was seen as a Nilfgaardian sympathizer and ultimately assassinated. His son, prince Kistrin took over as leader of the resistance. The corsairs from Skellige and the troops from Cidaris helped them to expel Joachim de Wett's group from Verden, but only due to de Wett's gross incompetence.
The rebellion was partially suppressed in 1268 by the Center Army Group led by Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn. The rebellion however slowed Nilfgaardian troops from reaching Temeria, thus giving the Nordlings extra time for preparations for the Battle of Brenna.
The final nail in the coffin for the Verden Operations Group was exactly the disaster at Brenna when Joachim and his troops were decimated by the north under Foltest and John Natalis.
After their defeat, Nilfgaard was forced to withdraw their armies to south of the Jaruga, leaving the only the fortresses of Rozrog, Nastrog and Bodrog occupied. After the peace treaty, the rest of the Nilfgaardians left and Verden was finally liberated, with Kistrin as the new ruler.

The grotto is a unique part of the Temple of Melitele in Ellander. It is hewn from the rock face behind the temple and has a roof made of translucent crystal. In it grow all sorts of plants and creatures useful in medicines and magic which are found nowhere else. Nenneke and the other priestesses tended the greenhouse, and taught lessons about the herbs growing there.
Climate changes changed the nature of sunlight in the world and that is why only the unique climate conditions in the grotto allow some of the to grow at all any more.

Gabriel was a craftsman from Verden who had the distinction of being the inventor of miniature crossbows, possibly wrist-mounted. Gabriels were named after the inventor and marketed as ideal for personal defense from bandits. They became very popular. Naturally they were also popular with the bandits.

Gabriel (weapon)

After its invention, an aggressive marketing campaign was initiated to sell them with slogans like "Protect yourself!" advertising its use to defend oneself from bandits and brigands. It became so popular that ironically most bandits could be counted on to have one as well, which fueled further sales. One can only assume that Gabriel died quite wealthy (or given Sapkowski's sense of humour, a victim of his own invention!).
"The Witcher".
In the game, the Professor uses a miniature wrist-mounted crossbow, which is more than likely one of these weapons.
The armorer in Midcopse advertises the Gabriel (spelled Gabrielle in subtitles) when spoken to, although he doesn't actually sell any crossbows whatsoever; being an armorer, he doesn't sell any weapons.
During The Final Trial, shooting down a few harpies with the crossbow will cause Lambert to comment that it takes down harpies so well he should think about getting a Gabriel for himself. This would imply that either all hand crossbows are manufactured under the Gabriel line of weapons, or that the original Gabriel has become so widely-known (likely through the marketing campaign) that "Gabriel" is now a colloquial term for many small crossbow weapons.

Boratek was a Redanian customs officer whose job consisted of inspecting goods ferried on the Pontar and imposing levies.
While lacking in social skills and etiquette, he was very enthusiastic about his work.
Biography.
In 1266, after a barge owned by Malatius and Grock Company went passed their inspection site, Boratek, his leader Olsen, and the other officers, took a boat out to board the barge. While Olsen already knew Geralt of Rivia, the guard of the barge, Boratek asked another passenger Linus Pitt whether he had Temerian or Nilfgaardian goods to declare. Olsen calmed the situation, and they all continued on the barge towards Oxenfurt.

The warder was a particularly brutal prison guard in Rinde who decided to beat Geralt senseless as his two colleagues held the witcher. He was described as taking particular pleasure in this.
Geralt, simply hoping to goad the guard, told the warder that he wished the man would simply burst. The plan being that this would enrage the man sufficiently that he would punch the witcher in the head rendering the latter unconscious and limiting the beating. Instead, Geralt's wish was fulfilled, much to everyone's astonishment and the man was reduced to red pulp in a flash.

The trio was forced to pull the rope-operated ferry across the river themselves as the ferryman was near paralytic and was clinging to one of the posts on the dock. He was clearly in no shape whatsoever to do the job himself. When they tried to speak with him, all the man could manage were a few unintelligible syllables.

Viraxas was the third King of Kerack. Returning from exile where he spent his time as a mercenary, he claimed Kerack's throne after his father Belohun's "unfortunate" death.
Viraxas' efforts to save his kingdom's economy would eventually drive him into cruel conflict and mutual hatred with the dryads of Brokilon.
Biography.
Youth and exile.
Viraxas was born as a legitimate son of King Belohun and he spent much of his youth outdoors, practicing with a wooden sword. The young prince was vigorous and strong – traits that his aging father viewed with envy. Growing quarrels between the two eventually led Belohun to furiously banish Viraxas without a judicial sentence and, as Viraxas left the palace, the prince stole a number of belongings, including his brother Egmund's Viroledan sword. Belohun went as far as forbidding the mention of Viraxas' name at court, though this didn't stop the gossip that spread, believing the reason for the banishment was the king's jealousy towards the vital son.
Adventure, love, and triumph.
The energetic prince did not wither during his exile. Through hardships abroad his skin became weathered and through adventures as a mercenary he learned unconventional fighting techniques and ways to inspire people under his command.
At one point, Viraxas met Ildiko Breckl, a young woman expelled from Aretuza for petty thievery. The two become partners and developed a deep love towards each other.
Despite all this, he did not forget his father's injustice. He eventually came in contact with the Chapter of Mages' agents, who promised to return him to the throne of Kerack in exchange for significant privileges in the kingdom's trade network. The deal was sealed, and the mages, through their facility in Rissberg, produced a magical necklace that was to choke Belohun when gifted to him by yet another of his brides-to-be; it was arranged for the bride to be Ildiko.
With the Chapter's money, Viraxas hired "Acherontia", a famed pirate frigate. Ildiko, believed by Belohun to be a simple 17 year old wench rather than a bright 25 year old Aretuza ex-student, convinced the king to "hire" the frigate in order to help him with the other two traitorous sons, Egmund and Xander. The climax occurred on Lammas, just before the planned wedding ceremony: the brothers were successfully arrested, the king unfortunately died from "apoplexy" while trying the necklace on, and Viraxas was appointed his successor "nemine contradicente" by the still shocked court.
King of Kerack.
Immediately following the court meeting, Viraxas ordered to cancel the planned wedding ceremony to mourn the death of the groom, and declared to share the already prepared wedding food with the poor of Palmyra, the capital city's slums. He also decided to restore the supposed ages-old tradition of Kerackese kings, that is in case of the groom's death his closest male relative was to marry the bride; while the "tradition" was obviously invented out of the blue as the Kingdom of Kerack was not even a century old, the courtiers did not object and promptly agreed with their liege's decision. The marriage between Viraxas and Ildiko was combined with the coronation ceremony.
The first days of rule were harsh for the young king. The capital city was ravaged by a tsunami just hours after his father's assassination; many ships in the port, including "Acherontia", drowned, and the slums area was swept from the ground. In order to finance the reconstruction and repay the debt he owed to the Chapter, Viraxas raised the custom duties and port fees and ordered the confiscation of nonhuman possessions. He also declared that mages in Kerack were not allowed to possess land or estates; this in particular was targeted towards Lytta Neyd, the only mage to own property in the kingdom, as Viraxas' wife and counselors were jealous of Lytta and outraged by her open abortion practices. To compensate the severe edicts, the king proclaimed his coronation date as public holiday and announced amnesty for criminals.
The need to repay the loan eventually led Viraxas to expand his realm eastwards, coming into inevitable conflict with Brokilonese dryads. Conflict, while at the beginning a strictly economic-driven pursuit for timber, would eventually develop into an ethnic war, driven by mutual hatred. Deep grievances arose, and Viraxas grew so hateful he never even sent an envoy to Queen Eithné. Severe stress resulting from the ongoing conflict worsened his health and made his hair turn grey prematurely.
Viraxas was involved in a number of incursions into the forest in cooperation with Verden or the Order of the White Rose, including the one during which Eithné's daughter Morénn was killed. In 1262, after a number of indecisive conflicts, Viraxas prepared a "blitzkrieg" into the forest: simultaneous attacks from multiple sides carried out by the armies of Kerack, Verden, and Maribor with Temeria's silent agreement, in order to achieve the "final solution to the dryad question". His plans however would ultimately prove to be his own undoing.
Death.
In 1262, Viraxas and his firstborn son Tarrand attended the wedding of Prince Fulko of Redania to Princess Frisanna of the Mariborian branch of Temeria. What Viraxas wasn't aware of was the fact that the princess was in fact a dryad herself, being the result of a summer romance of Maribor's Duke Jurkast, and had accidentally overheard the negotiations about the planned attack on Brokilon between Viraxas' ambassadors and King Foltest of Temeria.
During the lavish ceremony held in Tretorian Kreve cathedral, after the marriage vows, Viraxas was murdered by Frisanna who recognized him among the quests and went rampage, drawing her husband's ceremonial sword and piercing the Kerackese king's heart. Viraxas died in suffering and terror, next to his son yelling "treason".
Legacy.
Although Tarrand was outraged by the murder, he lacked his father's will. The king's bright commanders were replaced with Tarrand's flatterers who were unable to continue the crusade and the successor's sentiments prevented him from fulfilling Viraxas' genocidal plans. Until the Northern War II, Kerack and Brokilon were in uneasy armistice.

Wozgor

The Wozgor, or Vozgor, were an ancient ethnic group that settled on the Continent before Nordlings. According to the historian Arnelius Grock's accepted classification, they were human.
Characteristics.
Although much of their nature remains a mystery, it's said the Wozgor resembled Nordlings. However, they were easily distinguished by beards, skin clothing, and an overall dirty appearance. Like other contemporary human tribes, they were nomadic.
Culture.
Language.
The Wozgor had their own language and runes. Few writings survive on the tombstones in their necropolises that continue to be studied. Notably, Eltibald examined a decent amount in his investigations into the curse of the Black Sun.
Religion.
The Wozgor prayed to deities similar to Coram Agh Tera, Veyopatis, and Melitele, a goddess of harvest and fertility, a guardian of farmers and gardeners, and a patroness of love and marriage. However, the primary figure in the Wozgor beliefs was the goddess of war Lilit. According to tales, they used to offer her blood sacrifices, believing themselves to be her chosen followers who would survive her return and the massacre of the unfaithful.
History.
Alongside the Dauk, the Wozgor are seen among the earliest humans on the Continent. Founding settlements right after the Conjunction of the Spheres in the 230s BR, the Wozgor settled the area between the Dragon Mountains and the Gulf of Praxeda where now lie Narok, Talgar, the Hengfors League, Gelibol, the Nimnar valley, and even Velhad in the snowy Far North. More south, they colonized Mag Turga and Geso.
They rarely ever engaged the nonhumans. Scholars speculate there could have been wars between the Wozgor and werebbubbs, as it would explain why werebbubbs regard Lilit as the devil. When Nordling kings began forging their realms, most of the Wozgor were killed. A fraction escaped to the East, bringing the cult of Lilit along and merging with locals. The rest was likely assimilated, though some historians dispute it.

<doc id="10240" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10240" title="Dauk">
Dauk

The Dauk were people who populated the northern reaches of the Continent before the First Landing in the 760s. While the Dauk culture is gone, its heritage survives in mythological figures incorporated into the Nordling tradition.
Characteristics.
The appearance and behavior of the Dauk are shrouded in mystery. According to a recognized classification by the historian Arnelius Grock, they were humans.
Culture.
Language.
The Dauk had their own language and writing system. Their writings survive on menhirs and are still studied and deciphered. Notable yet controversial studies of several inscriptions were done by Eltibald, who delved into the curse of the Black Sun.
Society.
Similarly to how other human groups lived before the Nordlings introduced feudalism to the North, the Dauk were nomadic. As they discovered agriculture—evidenced by their worship of a goddess of harvest and fertility and a guardian of farmers and gardeners—the Dauk had begun to settle down and raise menhirs.
Apart from the aforementioned goddess similar to Melitele, they prayed to two deities regarded as precursors to Coram Agh Tera and Veyopatis by scholars. The menacing Lilit had her place in their myths too.
History.
Alongside the Wozgor, the Dauk are counted among most ancient humans on the Continent. Arriving immediately after the Conjunction of the Spheres, they settled between the Dragon Mountains and the Gulf of Praxeda in nowadays Narok, Talgar, the Hengfors League, Gelibol, the Nimnar valley, and went up to Velhad, which lies in the cold Far North. Their contact with elves and dwarves must have been limited as most nonhumans associate the dawn of the human age with the First Landing.
What led to their extinction is unknown and greatly disputed by historians. One theory holds they were gradually assimilated by Nordlings.

Hector Laabs was the elder and judge of the village of Breza which was raized and a leader in the subsequent refugee camp. He proved to be a reasonable man, unlike the village priest.

Breza

Breza is a village (or remains thereof) which was raised probably somewhere in Lower Sodden, but possibly Brugge. The elder was Hector Laabs, a reasonable man compared to the village priest.
Geralt and his companions stumble upon the makeshift camp only to have the residents try to extort money from them. When they demand to speak with the leader of the village, they come upon a scene which became the basis for the "lynching" of Abigail in "The Witcher". However, in the novel, the young woman about to be lynched was not a healer, but rather an unfortunately mentally deficient young woman who could not defend herself in any way. She was saved from her fate by Geralt, Regis and Zoltan Chivay.
Geralt stepped up and volunteered to be her champion, challenging the priest to a duel. The priest, in turn suggested that only divine judgement could save her and that proof could only shown if a champion was able to extract glowing hot irons from a fire with his bare hands, at which point, Regis stepped in. However, the village was set upon at that very moment by armed troops and that chariot to which the girl was tied was dragged away by the spooked horses. Later, it was learned that Zoltan and his "boys" had found her and liberated her.

Wise woman

A wise woman is usually the oldest woman in the village who was taken as a young girl to be the apprentice of the last wise woman. She will in turn take an apprentice when her time draws near. Wise women are knowledgeable in the old ways. While rural villages still depend on them, larger cities no longer do. In some places, they are hunted down and killed as witches.Always the oldest woman knows what stands written in the booke, said Dhun gloomily. And what she knows, she teaches some young one, when 'tis time for her to turn to earth. Heed ye, yerselves, how 'tis time for our old woman. So our old woman has taken Lille in and be teaching her. But for now, 'tis the old woman knows best. pg.179, "The Last Wish" (UK edition)The strange women and girls, called prophetesses or Wise Ones, who could be found in villages, didn't enjoy the favour of those noblemen who collected levies and profited from farming. Farmers always consulted the prophetesses on everything and believed them, blindly and boundlessly. pg.184, "The Last Wish" (UK edition)

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Brisingamen is the 150 Karat brilliant diamond which is part of the necklace adorning the statue of the goddess Freyja in her temple on Hindarsfjall. According to the slightly exaggerated opinion of Jarl Crach an Craite, the diamond is worth almost the all shipyards in Cidaris, including the employees and annual production for a year.
Yennefer needed to use Brisingamen to construct a megascope in order to communicate with some people necessary to find Vilgefortz's hideout. High priestess Sigrdrifa refused at the beginning but than she allowed it for the good of Ciri.

Mirror Effect

Mirror Effect is a magic spell which Visenna uses to kill the koshchey in the short story "Droga, z której się nie wraca". It is not a reflection spell in the traditional sense, but more of a parabolic mirror effect, a concentration of the sun's rays onto a specific target. The beast is said to explode quite spectacularly from the effect of the spell.

Necromancy

Necromancy is a subclass of magic which is aimed at casting spells on the dead, whether to reanimate a corpse temporarily for information or to re-live a dead man's last moments, and so forth.
Due to its invasive nature on the dead, as well as potential side effects, the practice is banned by the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.
History.
In 1271, Hanmarvyn's Blue Dream, a powerful necromantic ritual, was used on Auckes' corpse by the mage Dethmold and by Geralt to see his last moments of his life.
In 1272, necromancy was used in Freya's Garden by Yennefer on the corpse of Skjall to talk and ask him about Ciri.

<doc id="10344" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=10344" title="Polymorphism">
Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a rare magical ability that few mages possess, with Philippa Eilhart being one of the few known who was capable of it. She could transform herself into a large grey owl at will, and did so in early 1267, in Oxenfurt, when she, Geralt, Shani, and Dandelion had a run in with some of the less friendly residents.
Characteristics.
For mages, generally the only way to learn this ability is through years of serious magical study. However, humanoids aren't the only ones capable of polymorphy: it's been observed that golden dragons, like Villentretenmerth, have the innate ability to do so, taking on any form. The offspring of a golden dragon also inherit this ability, but generally they're far more limited, such as Villentretenmerth's daughter, Saesenthessis, only being able to take on a human form due to her mother being a non-golden dragon.
While it's also been observed that higher grades of vampires, like bruxae and alps, can also take on a humanoid form, it's unclear if this is polymorphism or a different ability due to the lack of research on vampires.

Teleportation

Teleportation is the magical displacement of beings or objects from one place to another. Sometimes this is achieved with a magic spell, but other times facilitating objects are used. Portals are an example of teleportation devices or passages. An example is the portal connecting the two towers of Tor Lara and Tor Zireael.
Many individuals, such as Geralt, perceive teleportation as dangerous. Not without a reason – not counting potentially missing body parts, the travel itself is risky as it is done through a strange realm where the time, heat, light and matter do not exist. Creatures from material plane trapped here are scarred and if they remain here too long they can become insane. If one is lost it is extremely hard to bring them back and only certain practitioners like Krepp claim they can try.
"The Witcher".
Triss uses teleportation a few times in the course of the game.
Teleportation is a spell which can be used by the player to travel up to 5 km, but it does come at a dangerous cost.

Telepathy

Telepathy is a psionic ability which most mages and psionics seem to possess. It includes the ability to transmit and receive information without recourse to speech — a very useful skill for private communication in public places.
Certain active stones, metals and crystals while worn can block incoming and outgoing telepathic "messages", should the mage wish to remain uncontactable.
In the 13th century, monarchs around the Northern Kingdoms relied on court mages sending telepathic messages between cities, as a thirty minute delivery via psionics far outlasted a four day ride for a message by horse.

Zurbarràn is a castle in Toussaint, located on the hill near Pomerol castle.

Funds from Gors Velen.
In June 1267, Molnar Giancardi transferred 1,500 orens from his bank at Yennefer of Vengerberg's request to the Cianfanelli Bank in Ellander, to fund Ciri's tuition at the Temple of Melitele.

A branch of the Cianfanelli Bank is located at the Gran'place, a famous square in Beauclair. It offers a standard selection of bank services, such as the ability to exchange orens and florens to crowns, and the provision of loans. This branch is headed by Giacomo Cianfanelli.
The bank is protected against several magical forms, including hypnosis, telepathy, witcher signs, and spells.

Language

A language is both a method and a system of communication used by sentient races throughout the world. Some became extinct as time passed, and its native speakers replaced it with a different one.
From the 8th into the 14th century, Common Speech was considered the most widespread language in the Continent, from Kovir and Poviss in the north, all the way down to Ebbing. After the 16th century however, Nilfgaardian encyclopedists Effenberg and Talbot consider it to be merely "ancient language" of the Empire's northern regions.

Dwarvish is the native tongue of dwarves considered one of the older languages, although it has become more of a second language for them. It's characterized by a large proportion of curses and swears, which have transitioned into use by humans as well.
Through the centuries, dwarves came to be so assimilated into human civilization and convinced about the harmfulness of chauvinism and the manifestation of otherness displayed so proudly by elves, that they use Common Speech not only when talking to humans, but even among themselves. Their youth barely knows Dwarvish and uses it very reluctantly.

During the formative centuries, Skelligers had their own runes but apparently adopted the modern alphabet or First Runes at some point later on.

It is characterized by long, drawn-out syllables and hard pronunciation.

Apart from dragons, cats are the only creatures known to absorb magical energy, but no one knows what they do with it. They are also instantly able to recognize witchers and exhibit an obvious disdain for them, like hissing at them. Cats can also see through invisibility.
In the Japanese-inspired land, some cats when growing old transform into yōkai - powerful and mysterious entities and spirits - such as nekomata, whose tails split into two and they gain powers, and maneki neko, which become extremely lucky to be around. These spirits are worshipped by the population, with shrines built in places like Mount Kaijinzan.

"".
Grindstones (or sharpening stones) is no longer an inventory item but instead an enhancement gained by interacting with a grindstone in the game and increases the power of your weapon by 20% for 15 minute.
They can typically be found in an area where there are blacksmiths or armorers, but the presence of these craftsmen is not strictly necessary. In the "Hearts of Stone" expansion, players can apply the "Preservation" runewords from the Runewright near Upper Mill, far northeast of Novigrad. This will enable both the grindstone and armorer's table's bonuses to be made permanent.
In the "Blood and Wine" expansion, you can purchase a grindstone for Corvo Bianco at the cost of 1,000 .
"Workbenches and sharpening stones can be found next to some smiths. You can use these to provide temporary boosts to their effectiveness. Workbenches and sharpening stones are indicated on your maps once you pass near them. This is where to go to get a boost before a tough fight."

Glamour

Glamour (Elder Speech: "Glamarye") is an ointment-like magical cosmetic which smells of lilac and gooseberries and makes a "dazzling impression". It is applied around the eyes and essentially bedazzles anyone who gazes upon the wearer. Yennefer used it when she and Ciri first entered Gors Velen after leaving Ellander.
In the short story "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna", Triss Merigold makes a batch of it for all the female guests at Geralt and Yennefer's wedding. Unfortunately for the halfling women, it seems glamour does not work for them at all.

He leads Ciri to Camelot at the court of King Arthur.
"Something Ends, Something Begins".
Galahad once became lost in the mists searching for Avalon, and is an unexpected guest at Geralt and Yennefer's wedding. The young knight is searching for the Holy Grail and mistakes the ruined castle of Rozrog for Montsalvat. He also mistakes King Herwig for the Fisher King.
He helps Ciri defeat an ilyocoris which has capsized the boat in which Herwig and Loki were fishing. He then pledges himself to Ciri, who strangely does not seem at all unhappy with the arrangement.

A hirikka is an endangered beast found in the Northern Kingdoms.
Characteristics.
An increasingly rare creature, even more so than a dragon, hirikkas live in the mountains. Their bodies are covered in thick skin, colored light yellow or brown, and long fur which hangs by sides and abdomen. While young hirikkas tend to be about human height, adult indivduals grow 4-5 cubits high and 7-8 cubits long. Their diet comprises mostly of grass and venison. They hunt mice first, moving to larger game with age. Hirikkas also gain significant amount of weight for a time, although they still can develop a the speed of a horse while chasing prey. If any cows or sheep share a field with hirikka, they will slowly die off due to poisonous grass in hirikka's saliva and excrements.
Although generally harmless when not hungry, hirikkas are responsible for much more death than the dreaded dragons just like wolves are. Commoners would hardly be able to pierce its skin, as it can't be penetrated by mere pitchforks. To kill a hirikka, a silver sword swung by a skilled witcher is needed.
In culture.
A potato and parsnip stew made out of properly-grilled hirikka meat and poached egg used to be immensely popular. In fact, the demand for the creature's meat grew so high that the chef who came up with the recipe was blamed for hirikka being almost extinct.

Knockers, also known by several different names including knacker, coblynau, bucca, polterduk, karkorios, rübezahl, or pustecki, are a larger and stronger breed of kobolds, even though they are rarer. They inhabit various adits, grooves, precipices, chasms, dark cavities, burrows, delves, grottos, caverns and rocky heaths. Their existence in the area is always evidence for the presence of wealth hidden in the ground, such as ores, minerals, salt or petroleum. Considered as the malicious rogues and pests, and the real scourge for miners who they tantalize and haunt by knocking the rocks, steal or destroy sidewalks, mining equipment and all possessions, sometimes even attack them but stop at a few bruises. However, miners can get at them by utilizing food and alcohol.
Geralt met one knocker, a friend of Avallac'h's, in the caves beneath Mount Gorgon. The knocker helped the witcher to get to Caed Myrkvid by letting him ride on him, albeit not very smoothly.
For some reason, a young bucca is often confused with a godling.
Physiologus entry.
The Knocker, likewise called a knacker, coblynau, bucca, polterduk, karkorios, rübezahl, or pustecki, is a form of kobold, which, nonetheless, the K. considerably surpasses in magnitude and strength. The K. as a rule also wears a great beard, which kobolds habitually do not. The K. dwells in adits, vertical shafts, spoil heaps, precipices, tenebrous hollows, inside rocks, in diverse grottos, caves and stone wildernesses. Wherever it dwells, natural riches such as metal, ore, carbon, salt or petroleum are surely buried in the earth. Thus, one may often encounter a K. in mines, particularly abandoned ones, although it is also likely to appear in active ones. It is a vicious scourge and pest, a curse and veritable divine retribution for miners and quarrymen, whom the vexatious K. leads astray. By knocking on the rock it beguiles and frightens, obstructs galleries, steals and spoils mining equipment and all kinds of belongings, and is also inclined to strike one on the head [from] a place of concealment. But it may be bribed, to curb its mischief-making, by placing in a dark gallery or shaft some bread and butter, a smoked cheese, or a flitch of smoked gammon; but best of all is a demijohn of alcohol, since the K. is extremely greedy for such. pg. 227, "The Tower of the Swallow" (US edition)

Bow

The bow is one of the oldest known projectile launchers, the only older weapon being possibly the sling. The act of using a bow is known as archery. Typically a basic bow is comprised of a pair of curved elastic limbs, typically of wood, connected by a string. A notched projectile, an arrow, is put in place and the string is then drawn back to maximum tension. Releasing the string causes the arrow to fly through the air to its intended target.
Master archers are capable of hitting very small objects from long distances as well as hitting moving targets. Dryads and inhabits of the Far North are among the best known archers. This fact can be disputed, as Geralt of Rivia stated that "Elves are the best archers to walk the Earth." As he gets the chance to witness their archery firsthand during the battle of Vergen.

Crossbow

A crossbow is a mechanically assisted bow which is used when more power is required, either to launch heavier projectiles or to launch a more conventional one a longer distance. The bows are usually cocked with the assistance of a or crank, but some use levers.
Gameplay.
In "", the crossbow has its own slot in the inventory and combat wheel but it only allows one type of ammunition to be equipped at a time; switching ammunition can be done on the inventory screen or the weapon wheel. The normal crossbow bolt is the weapon's default ammo when none is equipped, and while it lacks special properties it has an unlimited amount. Crossbows can be used during regular combat, underwater, on a horse, or at the helm of a boat. Note that while underwater, only the default bolt is available. However, crossbows are particularly effective underwater so this shouldn't be much of a hindrance.
While a crossbow item can be found before that point, Geralt will receive a basic one from Vesemir during the prologue in White Orchard, and will always have some default ammunition for it.
Crossbow's damage is dependent on three major factors: Geralt's ability build, the crossbow's damage attribute, and the equipped munition. The crossbow's base damage is the most detrimental factor since the other two variable would multiply on its value. Unlike other equipment, crossbows do not have slots for runestones.
Also unlike other equipment, crossbows are not scaled normally in New Game +. Any crossbow and bolts found or crafted in the bonus playthrough will have similar attributes found in normal ones, their effectiveness remains as if played in a normal playthrough however. This "shadow scaling" also applies to crossbows brought from a normal playthrough to a New Game +.
One can fire crossbow in two ways.
Geralt will have to complete a reload animation after each one shot (two, with the Trick Shot ability) before being able to fire again. Using crossbows cost no Stamina.
Crossbows are mostly useful for hitting flying beasts, like ekhidnae or griffins, to bring them down to earth; and it's the only usable weapon underwater. However, their potential as combat tools can be expanded and applied into different strategies.
"Blood and Wine" expansion introduces the Cat Eyes mutation that increases crossbows's damage by a considerable amount, boosting their capacity to function as secondary or even primary weapons.
List of Crossbows.
In addition to a number of homonymously named "Crossbow" items in the game, there are a many other crossbows in "" and its expansions.
"Main article: Bolts"
Ammunition.
A crossbow would be a useless weapon without ammunition or bolts in "". There are several types of bolts available to use with the crossbow.

Hjalmar an Craite, also known as Wrymouth (Polish: "Krzywogęby" meaning "slackjaw"), born 1248, is the son of Crach an Craite and is Cerys' older brother, who he has a constant, but good-natured, rivalry with. He was in love with Ciri.
Biography.
Early life.
He met Ciri during her stay in Skellige - where she spent a lot of her childhood. In Skellige, jumping competitions were held on ice and the boys would skate to see who could jump the farthest. However, Ciri was lightning fast and agile on the ice and the boys scoffed at the thought of being beaten by a young girl. Hjalmar attempted to beat Ciri but instead fell and injured himself. Despite this, he held no grudge against Ciri and, when she attended his bedside during his recovery, they fell in love.
When Ciri was 10 years old and Hjalmar was 15, they got "engaged." Unfortunately their happiness was not to be and Ciri was dragged teary-eyed back to Cintra and a young Hjalmar was left sulking in Skellige.
Northern Wars.
When the Slaughter of Cintra reached the ears of Hjalmar he sought to save his beloved. Alas, when he arrived at Cintra the place was already destroyed and its citizens massacred and Ciri had been taken by Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach.
Her escape from Cahir then opens up the chapter of her life with Geralt. When Yennefer returned to Skellige to reach Ciri, Hjalmar vowed to go on a ship with her to find his beloved to make up for missing Ciri in Cintra. However, despite volunteering to continue on the longship, "Alkyone", which Yennefer planned to use to sail into the infamous Sedna Abyss, she ordered the number to be parsed down to 8, the minimum amount of people needed to keep the ship going for a short time. While she let the captain pick which 8 to transfer, she ordered Hjalmar to stay behind on the second ship, "Tamara". When he protested she threatened to tie him to its mast to stay, likely saving his life as it was believed all the crew aboard the "Alkyone" later drowned or died when it was teleported away.
Hjalmar an Craite appears in the final installment of Geralt's trilogy. During the events of the game on Skellige, it is possible for Geralt to help either Cerys or Hjalmar to become the new ruler of the isles.
 "The saying "like father, like son" fits Crach and his first born son to a tittle. Young Hjalmar took after his father in both posture and character, and many predicted that in time he would ovetake his elder in the honor and fame he would gain."
 "An extremely able, broad-shouldered swordsman, he had the makings of a superb warrior, and his charisma and tendency towards almost mad bravura meant he could stir the hearts of loot- and glory-craving youth from all Skellige's clans."
 "All these traits made Hjalmar an obvious choice for the next king of Skellige. He thus did not hesitate to stake his claim when the time for this arrived and immediately set off for Undvik to prove his heroism by battling the legendary Ice Giant."
 "Hjalmar accomplished what he set out to do. Fighting side by side with the witcher he defeated the fierce colossus of Undvik."
 If Geralt sides with Cerys in King's Gambit:
 "Though his sister was chosen to be ruler instead of him, Hjalmar did not bear a grudge and decided to lend her reign all his strength, an act that showed surprising political maturity."
 "When discussing Hjalmar's heroic deeds it surely must be mentioned that he did not hesitate to support Geralt by answering his call and defending Ciri at Kaer Morhen."
 If Geralt doesn't side with either Hjalmar or Cerys in King's Gambit:
 "Hjalmar's hot temper turned out to be his doom in the end. Young an Craite died alongside his sister while leading one of the first attacks on the Nilfgaardian fleet."

Mercenary

Mercenary, or Condottiero, is a person who comes into an armed conflict for their own economic benefit: for money or other tangible benefits.
In some cases, condottieri are not just mercenaries, but the leaders of professional military Free Companies. For example, King Esterad Thyssen of Kovir and Poviss released some political prisoners formerly known as the Sly cats on the condition that they support the efforts to push back the Nilfgaardian invasion at the battles of Mayena and Brenna.

The Wicker Hag or Wicker Woman is a sort of human-shaped wooden cage in which druids were said to burn intruders. In fact, they tended to fill the wicker constructions with hay for grazing animals. Tales of flaming wicker cages was of course just folklore, but when the druids at Caed Myrkvid caught Schirrú and Homer Straggen, the flaminika decided to make the lore into reality, as a cautionary tale against future intruders.

Detchka was the daughter of the innkeeper at The Spearhead in Novigrad. She was described as having a lovely mouth, as long as it remained closed. When it was first discovered that Dudu was masquerading as Dainty Biberveldt, there was a scuffle and the girl fainted. Dandelion took the opportunity to save the damsel before she hit the ground, strategically choosing how he positioned his hands.

Merigold's Hailstorm

Merigold's Hailstorm is a very powerful magic spell which produces a hail storm.
It was created by accident and nobody has been able to replicate it as Triss, along with Yennefer, were injured during the Rivian Pogrom and subsequently the original spell they were trying to cast caused a hailstorm accompanied with lightning clouds instead. According to Nimue, the reason no one was able to replicate the spell is because Triss's mouth was cut and she was speaking indistinctly, and some people further claim that Triss' tongue was faltering from fear despite her reputation as courageous. One of the legend's versions states that Yennefer was with Triss on the Rivian Hil and that Triss was not alone, but this did not prove popular in the artist's vision.

Landsknechts are troops of colorful and dogged men, professional soldiers of fortune, whom cavalry can not frighten. Equipped with halberds, pikes, crossbows and double-handed swords that are roughly two yards long with hilt measuring two feet and large, curved cross guards they wake respect in many simpletons. Though predominantly of Temerian origins, they hail from and serve in armies of many Northern Kingdoms. According to Lambert, one of the Witcher fighting styles known as the strong style was devised by them.
Young Jarre and Melfi from Ellander met two Temerian Landsknechts on their way to the city of Vizima during the Second Northern War. 
Warfare.
In the Temerian Army, they form elite infantry units, famous across the Continent. In contrast to other countries, where mostly commoners serve as foot soldiers, a number of noblemen can be found in the ranks of these regiments. They are organized in regiments under the command of captains appointed by the King. They rarely use armors, and if so, then only soldiers at the front with breastplates and helmets.
Landsknechts fight in the serried squares. Maintaining the rigid discipline is required. Each soldier is obliged to kill his comrade-in-arms if he sees him breaking out of formation. The Temerians move as one body striking by hundreds, or sometimes even by thousands, at once. The first ranks attack with 16-foot-long pikes. They are followed by the halberdiers, while the center of a square (where the commander and the banner are) is secured by warriors equipped with two-handed swords. The crossbowmen protect the sides of the formation.

Knitbone

Knitbone (Polish: "Purpurowy żywokost") is a symbiotic plant that only grows in Brokilon and is used by the dryads in conjunction with conynhaela, a healing herb. Together, they enable the rapid regeneration of damaged or broken bones. Despite only growing in Brokilon, it appears that either the dryads or visiting elves trade it with outsiders, as some human herbalists have access to it and know how to apply it.
In July 1267, after the Thanedd coup, Geralt spent 36 days in Col Serrai being treated by Aglaïs for a broken leg and forearm using knitbone and conynhaela, to which he made a full recovery.

A pike, or pickerel, is species of fish which can grow to be incredibly large. Common folk may often classify marauding pikes as monsters.
The pike is an ambush predator; if its attack succeed, the target receive heavy wounds. When the pike itself is heavily wounded it tends to retreat, unlike the barracuda.
More gigantic breed of pike is called king pickerel. While considered extinct, few specimen can be found in the Pontar Delta.

Wind sprites are one type of sprite; creatures which are described in the ancient "Booke" which has been memorized by the village eldress in Lower Posada. They are usually considered to be friendly air spirits, but possibly they also have a mischievous streak. In Polish there are several equivalent terms: ""płanetnik", "chmurnik" or "obłocznik"".
 Cloud sprites and wind sprites be varied. Some rain pour, some wind roar, others hurl their thunder. Harvests to protect from them, takest thou a knife of iron, new, of a mouse's droppings a half ounce, of a grey heron's fat— pg. 179, "The Last Wish" (U.K. edition)
...The easiest access they find at cottages of honest, simple, and unwitting peasants who readily ascribe all misfortune and ill events to spells, unnatural creatures and monsters, the doings of windsprites or evil spirits. Instead of praying to the gods, instead of bearing rich offerings to the temple, such a simpleton is ready to give his last penny to the base witcher, believing the witcher, the godless changeling, will turn around his fate and save him from misfortune. pg. 165, "Blood of Elves" (U.K. edition)

Belohun was the second king of Kerack, son of Osmyk, and father of 6 sons and 8 daughters, though only 4 of the sons had any legal claim to the throne. By the year of his death, he'd ruled for over 20 years and it was believed he was in good enough form that he'd rule for another 20.
Biography.
Belohun came into power after at least 4 other brothers all renounced the right to Kerack's throne, one of whom did so willingly, and thus it fell onto Belohun as the new successor. Following in his father's steps, he derived profits from the small kingdom through their maritime trade, including piracy. However, this was a clear double-standard: while piracy was fine, he hated those who embezzled funds from the royal purse. The sorceress Lytta Neyd, who visited in 1245, used this to prompt Belohun to throw Geralt into jail under false embezzlement charges for 4 days as part of her plan to get the witcher to do her bidding.
Belohun had gone through at least 4 wives, each one having mysteriously died when he got bored and found a new one to marry, and thus had 4 legitimate sons but all with a different mother. Despite this, he'd banished the eldest, the second was a deranged drunk kept out of sight, and the last two, Egmund and Xander, didn't seem fit to take over, and thus the king decided to take on another wife to try for another son and heir, not hiding this fact from his last two legitimate sons. He became engaged to Ildiko Breckl and planned to wed soon after.
Outraged by this, Egmund and Xander organized a coup d'état, ordering a poisoner to put some contact poison on Belohun's poker.
The plan however failed, since the poisoner betrayed the two princes and told the truth to Belohun, who then imprisoned Egmund and Xander.
Later, while Belohun was wearing his ceremony dress, a magic necklace gifted to him from Ildiko Breckl, wrapped around his throat and suffocated him. The medic, who arrived soon after, wrongly ascertained that Belohun died from an epileptic fit.
When the courtiers, pained by their loss, entered in the throne room, they found the exiled Prince Viraxas seated next to Ildiko Breckl.

New Forge

New Forge ("Nowa Kuźnica", in Polish) is a village in Geso, located roughly about two days' ride from Glyswen, near the Velda river.
History.
In July 1267, after Baron Lutz of Tyffi had posted a bounty for the Rats, the Nissir were sent word by New Forge's headman that Kayleigh, one of the Rats' members, was in the village seeing his girlfriend. The bounty hunters captured the boy to be taken to Tyffi.
Later, the gang returned with a new member Ciri, and set fire to the village for the headman's betrayal.

Devil's Ford

The port at Devil's Ford is the location of a well-known horse market a few days' journey from Novigrad. According to Dudu, while it may be a very well-known market, it is not in fact the place to get the best price for the beasts as the merchants there tend to collude rather than compete. There are also the costs associated with organizing the market which are then factored into the prices of the horses, so a wise vendor would seek to sell his animals where horses were more scarce and fewer overhead costs... say, in Novigrad itself.
For example, a horse could fetch 90, or even 100 crowns at the Devil's Ford market but Dudu was able to get 130 crowns per animal by selling them at the port of Novigrad where only (rather slow moving) oxen were left to transport goods. In particular, an overseas shipment of pelts, while light, required rapid transportation to other markets. With all the other horses in town sent to the market at Devil's Ford, Dudu found himself able to name his own (decidedly better) price and realize a much tidier profit.
It was just one day's journey from the market that Dainty Biberveldt and his retinue stopped to rest for the night on their way to sell the halfling's horses. After an evening of drinking and merriment, everyone retired for the night but Dainty needed to relieve himself. It was then that he first came face to face with his mirror image and began his real financial education.
This tale is related in the short story "Eternal Flame" in "Sword of Destiny".

Fish refer to a variety of aquatic animals that have gills allowing them to breathe water instead of air. Varied in size, preferred habitat or feeding behavior, they form a diverse group of creatures.
Fish in culture.
Fish are one of the main sources of food in human countries such as Skellige or Arcsea. The importance of these creatures in local economies has led to introducing them as heraldic animals, with the coat of arms of the kingdom of Cidaris being the prime example. Some people tend to use names of fish species as nicknames or names for their pets; a notable one is Roach, name used by Geralt of Rivia to name his mares.
According to Oxenfurt scholars, many of the fish species are endangered or even extinct. The druids are afraid that overfishing may mark end to all fish over the course of subsequent millenia.
Notable fish species.
Barracuda.
The barracuda is a large predatory fish. It is much tougher and skilled in attack than the pike and does not retreat even when heavily wounded.
Great mouthbrooder.
The great mouthbrooder is a giant fish with enormous jaw. While tougher than the barracuda or pike, it is much slower and less agile, which makes spotting it and escaping relatively easy.
Its large teeth are utilized by water nymphs who use them to make knives.
Pike and king pickerel.

Sea creatures are distinct from mere fish for two reasons: they tend to be larger creatures and they tend to inhabit larger bodies of water. Sea creatures are found in the oceans and seas, whereas fish are found in rivers, deltas and lakes.

Water creatures form a rather large group. They are broken down by habitat and relative threat. The habitats include swamps and marshy areas, inland bodies of water (rivers, deltas and lakes), and larger bodies of water (seas, and oceans).

Unist was a sergeant in the Kaedwenian Army, stationed at the fortress/bridge south of the Buina.
History.
In February 1266, he fought in a battle against Scoia'tael, who attacked the fort. The next day, Geralt, Ciri, and Triss stopped at the fort on their way to Ellander from Kaer Morhen.
As Triss was quite sick, Unist gave her a bed, hoping if she started to feel better, she could help his injured soldiers. While discussing the Scoia'tael with Geralt, he realized he could not help the three, especially since he was falsely worried she may have been contagious, and so asked them to leave and head towards a southern convoy that had passed through recently.

Vera Loewenhaupt

Vera Loewenhaupt (d. August 1267) was a merchant who, along with her sons, ran a wickerware business, "Vera Loewenhaupt and Sons".
Biography.
In 1267, she attended Dandelion's concert beneath Bleobheris, where she recalled to him that she first met Geralt of Rivia in Vizima when he lifted the princess' curse, and then again later on the Merchants' Trail when the witcher slew a griffin which had been preying on caravans.
Later that year, at the start of August, on the road north from Dillingen through Brugge, she was stopped and assaulted by Scoia'tael looking to rob her. They then broke her neck, stole her jewellery, and dumped her body upon her wagon which was pushed into a ditch. Geralt, Milva, Dandelion, and Zoltan Chivay's company later came across her body on the 7th, and seeing as she had no further need for her wagon, the group used it to haul themselves through the war-torn land.

Time of Contempt (UK) or The Time of Contempt (U.S.) (Polish: "Czas pogardy") was written by Andrzej Sapkowski, first published in Poland in 1995 by SUPERNOWA, and is the fourth book in "The Witcher" series and the second novel in the saga. It directly continues on from "Blood of Elves", which begins the saga of Ciri and Geralt.
The English translation of the novel was originally going to be translated by Danusia Stok but that was eventually changed to David French. It "was "expected to be published in the fall of 2010. This release date was missed however and saw numerous edits. Gollancz, at the time, was criticized for missing the numerous release dates. This turn of events pushed "Baptism of Fire" further back.
"Time of Contempt" was first released in the UK on 27 June 2013 (published by Gollancz). A Kindle edition was released simultaneously. A second edition was released on 23 January 2014. A U.S. edition, "The Time Of Contempt", was released by Orbit Books on 27 August 2013.
Summary.
The story begins where "Blood of Elves" left off, essentially with Ciri and Yennefer having just left the Temple in Ellander, on their way to Gors Velen, and ultimately Thanedd Island. It is Yennefer's intention that Ciri be enrolled at Aretuza and that she continue her instruction in the use and mastery of magic.
Once they arrive in Gors Velen, Yennefer goes to see her old friend Giancardi Molnar, a dwarven banker. The latter informs the sorceress that her financial movements are being tracked, something Yennefer already suspected, but he arranges an essentially unlimited line of credit for her and makes several financial transfers to cover expenses for Ciri's education. He and Yennefer also agree to allow Ciri to see the sights, escorted by one of Molnar's faithful employees, Fabio Sachs.
While on their excursion, things get quickly out of hand after a Wyvern being held as a sideshow breaks free of its cage, and Ciri uses a magical amulet given to her by Yennefer in case of emergency. Because those who understand magic can sense when magic is being used, Ciri is noticed by two sorceresses. She is mistaken for one of about a dozen students who have recently "escaped" from Aretuza in the kerfuffle leading up to the mages' conference being held there. She is apprehended by no less than the former and current headmistresses of the academy, Tissaia de Vries and Margarita (Rita) Laux-Antille.
At first, the sorceresses do not believe Ciri's story, but ultimately, the girl and Fabio manage to convince the headmistresses to check out their story at the bank and things are quickly confirmed by Yennefer and Giancardi. The three sorceresses then decide to discuss events over at the Silver Heron, taking Ciri with them and leaving poor Fabio to deal with his employer.
At the inn, Tissaia and Rita have rented the entire cellar which is actually a bath house and the four "ladies" retire there to relax and chat. It seems that both Rita and Tissaia, but especially Rita have every intention of getting good and drunk and Ciri is dispatched to refill their caraff of wine not very long after it arrives.
While getting the refreshments, Ciri notices a mercenary (Rayla) who orders the innkeeper to open a back door for her — a door which leads directly to the outer walls of the city, bypassing the usual gates and guards. On her second trip to refill the caraff, Ciri uses her new found knowledge and runs away to see Geralt whom she has been told is at Hirundum, not far from Gors Velen. Yennefer, luckily is not far behind. Ciri's flight does, however, provide Geralt and Yennefer with an opportunity to meet up again and to patch things in their relationship before the three set off for Thanedd Island together.
On the island, things are in a tizzy. The girls have been temporarily moved from their usual accommodation within Aretuza to Loxia, the lowest level of the complex as the school itself is being used to accommodate the visiting sorcerers and sorceresses. That evening, Yennefer takes Geralt as her date to the reception, leaving Ciri in her room and ensuring that there is no second flight with magic.
At the reception, Geralt meets quite a few interesting individuals, but in particular he meets Vilgefortz for the first time. The mage is considered very young (which of course is anything less than 100 years to mages, but he looks more like 35), he is also considered to be particularly talented, but as Geralt finds out, his road to becoming a mage was not exactly the usual route. The wizard was abandoned as a baby and taken in and raised by druids. It was only as an adult that he became a mage. A point he underlines with some emphasis to the witcher. He even goes so far as to try to encourage Geralt to become a mage himself, but the witcher refuses.
Dijkstra also tries to recruit the witcher to no avail.
After the reception, Yennefer and Geralt retire to their room and re-connect on a more intimate level. After a very fruitful reunion and a bit of sleep, the witcher is awakened by an urge to urinate, but in deference to his hosts, decides against relieving himself in the flower pots outside the window and decides to find the courtyard. This is when he stumbles upon the coup, already taking place. Philippa Eilhart and Dijkstra, a sorceress and spy working for the King of Redania, organizes the coup and plans to reveal the mages working for Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard.
In the ensuing confusion we find out that Yennefer had brought Ciri before the Chapter on the request of Tissaia and the girl begins to prophesize. Ciri reveals the asssasination of the King of Redania the night before and that Demavend, king of Aedirn has preemptively started an attack on Nilfgaard. The Northern Kings' interest in waging war against the scoia'tael combined with Ciri's revelations infuriates Tissaia, who is against such violence. She inactivates the barrier of casting spells in the school and sides with Vilgefortz in the matter, leading to a deadly battle among mages.
In the meantime Geralt escapes from Dijkstra and rushes in to save Yennefer and Ciri at the school. In the ensuring chaos Yennefer and Geralt fight the invading scoi'tael supporting Vilgefortz, while Ciri flees from the scene. The Black Rider plaguing Ciri's dreams turns out to be a Nilfgaardian soldier that tried to escort Ciri out of Cintra to safety. Geralt finally faces Vilgefortz, who makes him an offer to join him to his side under Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. Geralt refuses and a fight ensues in which Geralt is soundly defeated. Tissaia finally realizes her mistake and along with Triss Merigold's help, takes Geralt to safety.
Emperor Emhyr var Emreis wanted the Chapter of Mages to be broken apart since the sorcerers and mages were the reason for his loss at the battle of Sodden Hill. The break up of the Chapter and the incoming war breaks Tissaia and she commits suicide. Soon after the events at Thanedd Island, a full blown war erupts with Nilfgaard advancing to the north. King Demavend escapes to Redania while Aedirn, Rivia, and Vengerberg soundly falls to Emhyr's grasps. King Foltest of Temeria forms a deal with Emhyr and avoids war on Temeria at the moment. In the meantime Emhyr manages to find a fake Ciri, which he presents to his court and publically announces his plans to protect her by sending her to a far away castle in his kingdom.
Ciri escapes via a portal in Tor Lara, also known as the Gulls' Tower, during Geralt's fight with Vilgefortz. She awakens in Korath desert known to many as the 'frying pan' and barely manages to stay alive, thanks to the help of a unicorn, whom she names "Little Horse". When pushed for survival, she relies on her magical abilities involving fire, which invokes more nightmares and hallucinations that forcefully entices her to take revenge on those who abandoned her, which leaves her scarred and promising herself to avoid fire as a source of power.
After escaping the desert, she is captured by bounty hunters of Nilfgaard and manages to escape from them with the help of bandits known as the Rats. She feels safe and gains a sense of belonging among the group as the members faced a similar harsh reality of being abandoned during the times of contempt. Through her skills she learned in Kaer Morhen she impresses the group, which gains her the name Falka.

Transportation

The primary method of transportation in the novels is horseback; if people cannot walk to their destination, they ride horses or use horse-drawn carts and wagons.
There are also magical methods of transportation. The physical manifestations are in the form of portals and these are quite rare. Some of the more powerful mages are also able to conjure portals at will.

The Cultists' Crypt is "not an official" , but because it has similar characteristics to other small quests in the game, it will be treated in the same manner as an official but optional quest. It may take place either in Chapters II or III when Geralt finds the Letter for Knight Eric and the Lionhead Spider crypt key on a dead knight in the Sewers under the Temple Quarter.
Walkthrough.
In the Sewers under the Temple Quarter you will find a dead body of an Order knight. On his body there is a letter addressed to "Knight Eric", describing the location of a secret base of operations for the Lionhead Spider, and a key which will unlock the gate to the Lionhead Spider Cultists' lair.
The cultists' crypt is fairly well populated by fanatical Lionhead Spider cultists, jealously guarding their stashes of alchemical ingredients, jewellery and money. The crypt is also moderately rich in sewant mushrooms.
There are several Aard-able stone walls in the crypt that you must break through in order to assault the cultists and claim their valuables as your own, as well as two Circle of Elements: the Circle of Lifeless Air and the Circle of Inner Fire.

&lt;/infobox&gt;Creature labelled simply as Mutant is one of the mutants created by Salamandra.
They possess no skin, Appearing to have only red muscles. Most of their bones have begun to stick out of their muscles and flesh, a thing they often utilize in battle. They have odd monstrous feet that sort of reassemble that of a monkey's, With deformed faces and sharp teeth, topped off with erie yellow eyes making them quite formidable in appearance. The only clothes they seem to wear are loin cloths, They have no preference of weapon and will strike with anything that can fit within their hands.
 "It seems that the proposed method of mutation leads nowhere. Fast, agile and aggressive creatures are born as a result of the transformation; however, they lack intelligence. They are closer to animals than men. Of course, that does not mean we will not find any practical use for them. On the contrary, simplified mutating procedures guarantee that we can create many Mutants, which are perfect tools for spreading chaos and terror."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the mutant taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
A fast, agile, and cunning opponent — such is the mutant, a result of the first series of experiments conducted on humans by the Order of the Flaming Rose. It is not yet a perfect weapon, but the mutant provides excellent support to the Order's heavily armoured forces.
For the Order, this creature is a sort of test, a prelude to the proper experiment that leads to the creation of the perfect warrior. This monster had to look like an abortive prototype. The exposed bones of the chest, missing skin, and strongly deformed face suggest that the experimenters did not have full control of the deformations. Bony crests on the beast's back, head and forearms indicate that the genes of a monster were used in the mutation. The detailed sketch depicts the mutant's head, its muscle layers in disarray after shrinking, tearing, and shifting during the mutation.
The creature's feet are an intriguing anatomical detail. They are, in fact, another pair of hands that render the mutant similar to a monkey. With four hands, the mutant easily climbs trees and jumps from limb to limb in a bid to escape or to await its foes in ambush.

Patch 1.5 (The Witcher)

◄ Previous | 
Patch 1.5 for "The Witcher" focuses mainly on removing the troublesome DRM (Digital Rights Management), allowing you to play the game without the disc, while providing many additional hours of fun thanks to five new adventures created by the fan community.
"Note:" Unlike previous patches, this patch is "not cumulative" and assumes that you are patching a of the game.
The Witcher Patch is the next stage of "The Witcher"'s life, and is also a means of expressing our thanks to the modding community for their hard work on creating the adventures. The update also works with the which was released on July 31, 2009.

Additionally, there are five new adventures made by the Witcher community:
The new community adventures are available in English only (for the time being)! In order to install patch 1.5 correctly, you should have original Witcher game upgraded to 1.4 (enhanced edition). It can be found here
File integrity.
To check the integrity of downloaded files, one can use an MD5 hash to calculate the MD5sum of the downloaded file and compare it with a known good sum. Below is a table of known good MD5sums (the list will be fleshed out shortly):
There are many tools that can calculate an MD5sum, for reference one can use the freely available MD5-Checksum by Nero because it lets you specify a known good MD5sum and it automatically compares it with the MD5sum calculated from your chosen file.
Step 0. Copy a MD5sum into the clipboard by selecting a MD5sum from above for the wanted file, and pressing CTRL-C.
Step 1. Start the MD5-Checksum program and press PASTE, the sum will be written in the program.
Step 2. Press BROWSE and choose the wanted file.
Step 3. After you choose the file the program will calculate the MD5sum, be patient, this can take a bit depending on the speed of your hard drive and processor.
MD5sum correct
Step 4. If the MD5sum is the same you will get a message saying "MD5 Verification succeed!."
Step 5. After pressing OK the MD5sum will be shown in a green color, now you can paste another MD5sum and check another file.
MD5sum Incorrect
Step 6. If the MD5sum is not the same as the correct one, or if you accidentally modified the written MD5sum an error message will appear stating "MD5 Verification Failed!" and some directions are given, if this happens to you then it means that the file needs to be downloaded again.
Step 7. After pressing OK the MD5sum will be shown in a red color.

Succubus

A succubus (female) or incubus (male) is a creature, sometimes considered "a demon", looking like a highly attractive human being seducing real humans, first appearing in dreams from time to time, then physically, and is interested only in men that have already come of age. Neither succubi nor incubi are particularly violent, though they draw energy from the men and women to sustain themselves, often until the point of exhaustion or death of the victim.

A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading Journey to the End of the World.
"Again?! Good grief, woman, I'm spent...– Lester of Smallton to a succubus, a few days before taking a vow of celibacy"
"Unlike other monsters, succubi and menads feel no desire to kill, do not crave human blood and usually do not, in fact, mean any harm at all. They are motivated by one thing and one thing only: an insatiable lust. They try in vain to slake this by engaging in sexual acts with any other humanoid species they encounter. While it must be admitted that their "victims" rarely put up much resistance, this does not mean succubi and menads do not present any danger: their never-ending advances, though pleasurable at first, have pushed more than one man to madness or even death."
"Succubi and menads usually can be found near human settlement, including small villages and populous cities. They prowl at night, though when stricken by serious need they will leave their lairs during the day as well. They shower their affections on men as well as women, the young as well as the old, the ugly as well as the beautiful. Some of them are particularly fond of pastors and other holy men, whose seduction they treat as a sort of game."
"Though succubi are peaceful by nature, when forced to fight they will defend themselves fiercely. One should thus not be fooled by their fair appearance – under the velvety skin of their arms lie muscles of iron, and a blow delivered with their rear, goat-like legs or the thick horns on their head can easily crush bone."
Combat tactics.
Clever witchers may be able to talk down a succubus, with stories of witchers seducing a succubus and allowing them to flee a region whispered among commoners. Should a witcher choose to slay a succubus, they must act quickly. Succubi are known for their surprising brute strength.
They can also be accomplished spell-slingers in their own right, commanding fire with natural aptitude. The simple flashes of fire that a succubus can call upon can disrupt any sword technique a witcher is capable of, and there is no defense save for quen, or frantic rolls away from the flames.
Relentlessness is key. A succubus cannot be allowed to control a battle. Exploding bolts or aard can disrupt their spell-weaving, Northern Wind can freeze them in place. A witcher will succeed in slaying a succubus if they can pin them down and unleash a flurry of strikes.
"Note:" Prior to Patch 4.0, succubi were vulnerable to steel swords instead of silver. This caused a unique problem as one could not actually use hybrid oil against them, which also meant that perks requiring use of an appropriate oil, like Protective Coating, would not work.

Excellent leather jacket looks similar to the starter armor, except with spiked gauntlets. This is the armor Geralt is seen using in the beginning and end cinematics.
It is available from any armorer or weapons dealer in Chapters II and III (Note: Not available from the blacksmith's son in Chapter IV).

Night of Knives and Torches

The Night of Knives and Torches was a culminating event in a bloody power struggle which began with the Secession of Poviss, when King Rhyd declared himself autonomous. Through this, he gained independence for the East March (which later split into several duchies and kingdoms, only to finally unite as the so-called "Hengfors League"). But the worst was yet to come - there was a revolt in Kovir as well and Baldwin Thyssen lost control of the kingdom to Idi, and for the first time in the history of the house, the Thyssens were forced to flee. During the escape, King Baldwin died suddenly leaving his son Esterad to lead the family.
But Esterad did not bide his time in exile unproductively. He considered various plans, gathered his strength, gained adherents, including forging secret pacts and alliances. Finally, he struck back and decisively. That night has been known ever since as the "Night of Knives and Torches", Idi, Rhyd and their entire families were killed. The Thyssen dynasty was restored.
One consequence of these events was that Kovir forever lost the East March, having failed to take it into account when restoring the dynasty.

Reputation system

In the early stages of the development of "The Witcher" there was a Reputation System planned as part of character development. Geralt could earn a good or bad reputation depending on his choice of action in the game. For the final version of the game this feature was dropped completely. Unfortunately there is not much known (yet) about how Geralt earned a good or bad reputation. One would assume that he earned it in the way how he responded to other s. It is unlikely that quests alone were the source of good or bad "reputation points" because one of the prominent features of the game is that there is no differentiation between "good" or "bad" quests.
It stands to reason that CD PROJEKT RED refrained from using this feature precisely for this reason as it would suddenly be at odds with their statement that "there are no good or bad decisions, only choices".
Companions.
At any rate Geralt's reputation had an impact on his environment and, in particular, on the NPCs with whom he interacts. A good example is the diversity of bandits. If Geralt had a bad reputation it was easier for him to get information and even support from bandits. He could engage them to help him in several ways to complete any given mission when he was in need of a bit of extra backup. The game trailer about the decision system in the game offers one option to solve the quest: Geralt with a bad reputation makes a deal with thugs to help him. Of course Geralt with a bad reputation building a rapport with "the criminal element" should take care to avoid the City Guard who already have a poor view of witchers and probably would not hesitate to arrest him.
If the witcher had a good reputation, then he would be likely not to tangle with bandits. They would not help him, they would likely be even more hostile. But on the other hand Geralt probably would get support from the "good guys", the City Guard. Possibly this could have avoided bribes. Likely he would get more support and information from townsfolk and peasants as well.

The Hexer (Polish: "Wiedźmin") is the international title of both a movie (2001) and a television series (2002) based on the witcher short stories by Andrzej Sapkowski, although it is more commonly referred to as The Witcher by fans since the release of "The Witcher". Both the movie and the television series were directed by Marek Brodzki, written by Michał Szczerbic, and produced by Lew Rywin. The role of Geralt was played by Michał Żebrowski, and the music was composed by Grzegorz Ciechowski.
Consisting of 13 episodes, the TV series came out one year after the movie. It was much more coherent than the confusing movie, but was still considered a failure mostly due to the film's already bad reputation and due to vast changes to the source material.

Attack of opportunity

An attack of opportunity (often abbreviated to AoO) in "The Witcher" is a chance for Geralt's opponents to attack him while he is otherwise occupied during combat. In the case of ranged attacks, this is most likely during the "power up" portion of the attack. In the case of potions, it is quite likely during the time it takes for Geralt to use a potion if he does so during the actual battle.
Specifically, on the "Hard" difficulty level, Geralt's enemies take full advantage of these opportunities to attack him, making the combat in the game more difficult. For "Easy" or "Normal" difficulty levels, they do not.

The baron's body swelled as his muscles grew, his noble attire fell in tatters on the marble floor. 'My beloved, you... you are so hairy. You are a werewolf!' Bianca went pale. 'What about our love?'

Against the Institution of Marriage is a book in "The Witcher" and is attributed to the mage Dorregaray. It mentions both marriage and royal wyverns. In the game, Dorregary's name is misspelled and appears as "Master Dorgeray".
Excerpt.
 "The female royal wyvern is smaller but more cunning and venomous than her male counterpart. She can be aggressive towards both males and other females.

The Witcher trophy quests

Trophy quests begin when a head is removed from an exceptional monster's remains. There are ten of these quests in "The Witcher", two in each chapter. They are all secondary, although completing the main plot will require beginning (not necessarily completing) The Beast of the Sewers.
Trophy heads can be redeemed whenever Geralt has access to the current chapter's "trophy official" (these are noted by chapter below). However, since you can only carry one at a time, turning them in as you get them is more efficient. ("Up to patch 1.4, trophy heads could be stored at inns. It has been reported that since that patch, it may be possible.")
The target of a trophy quest is usually larger than others of its kind, but is primarily set apart by having a specific name.
Trophy heads do not seem to despawn if you drop them.
Periodic additional rewards.
For a dedicated trophy-hunter, there are occasional rewards beyond the money and experience. Note that when the third/fifth/tenth trophy is turned in, the bonus is given the "next" time Geralt speaks with a "trophy official".
Third trophy: After three trophy heads have been handed in, Geralt receives a Svarog temporary rune.
Fifth trophy: There is also a reward after five heads have been redeemed — a Perun temporary rune.
Tenth trophy: Finally, there is the ultimate reward for handing in all ten trophies - a choice between two splendid swords: the Moon Blade (silver) or G'valchir (steel).

The Royal huntsman will mention these two. He can be found camping, just past the first two abandoned huts west of the Outskirts Inn.
Vincent Meis assumes the Royal Huntsman's trophy-exchange duties. His post is just outside the dungeon near the Gate to the Trade Quarter - though while waiting for the cockatrice's head he will be in the dungeon proper, and at night he is nowhere to be found...
The Royal huntsman is back, now found just outside the cemetery gate in the Trade Quarter (just south of the guardhouse's upper floor), but his role remains the same.
Tobias Hoffman can be found during business hours at his home in the village of Murky Waters. He will tip you off to the existence of two monsters haunting the nearby fields.
The Royal huntsman is in the druids' cave during this chapter; he will mention two pesky critters haunting the swamp cemetery.

Honeycomb is a food item in "" that can be found as loot or purchased from some merchants.
Locations.
While it is possible to find them as random loot a much better source are beehives. Each beehive will yield between 1-4 honeycombs. When Geralt gets too close to a beehive the bees will attempt to sting him and he will start losing health. In order to get the honeycombs the beehive must first be struck with Igni, after which the bees will be gone and the beehive will start burning then fall on the ground and will be safe to loot now. It is also possible to knock a beehive down using Aard, however, that will not allow the honeycombs to be looted and just anger the bees, making their attack range greater.
"Note:" While all beehives respawn they can only be looted once, so while they can be burned again no more honeycombs will be obtained from them.
There are plenty of beehives in White Orchard alone, by searching the area thoroughly it is possible to find over 100 honeycombs. More can be found in other maps, however, they are more spread out. In the outskirts of Novigrad, Geralt will also start encountering domesticated beehives, that are free to loot and don't need to be burned.

&lt;/infobox&gt;The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl. One of the most common and widespread domestic animals, used by humans of Northern Kingdoms and Nilfgaardian Empire primarily as a source of food - both their meat and their eggs are consumable.
Male chickens are called roosters (older than a year), capons (castrated males), or cockerel (young rooster); females are hens (older than a year) or pullets (younger ones). The young are called chicks.

Kingslayers

The Kingslayers, also known as Assassins of Kings, were an organization made up of a handful of witchers from the School of the Viper in the service of Nilfgaardian Imperator Emhyr var Emreis. The organization's task was to spread chaos in the kingdoms of the North by killing their kings with Letho of Gulet as the leader.
History.
Beginnings.
The group was once saved by Geralt, and Geralt learns he turned over Yennefer of Vengerberg to their care. They eventually made their way into Nilfgaard, where they were given a mission by Vattier de Rideaux and the Imperator Emhyr var Emreis, to destabilize the Northern Kingdoms by assassinating monarchs. In exchange, the Emperor promised to rebuild their witcher school. Letho agreed, gathered his comrades and the witchers arrived in a North. 
Originally Letho planned Esterad Thyssen, king of Kovir and Poviss, to be the first victim but before he could progress to slay him, he was hired by Síle de Tansarville and Philippa Eilhart to assassinate Aedirnian King Demavend III. At the same time, another kingslayer approached Vizima to assault Foltest, king of Temeria.
Foltest and Demavend.
On September 1270, a masked kingslayer sneaked to Royal Palace in Vizima and attempted to kill Foltest but monarch was defended by Geralt. The assassin was very skilled and fought using two swords. The battle was pitched and the outcome did not seem at all certain, but at the last moment, Geralt threw his recently acquired coin purse. This ploy startles the assailant sufficiently to allow Geralt an unparried blow. In the aftermath, both Geralt and King Foltest looked closely at the man's face which has now been unmasked. Inexplicably, the man appears to have the same eye mutation as Geralt.
In spring of 1271, during a bright day, Demavend III was killed on his ship by Letho, who defeated king's knights Himsbach and Anselm, mage Abelard of Hagge and archer Tybalt of Vengerberg. Then he proceeded by cutting his head to use it as proof. It's possible that a crew of nearby ship saw it and would go against the killer but he managed to flee the scene with a help of Iorveth's Scoia'tael commando.
When Letho learned that Foltest was still alive, he devised a plot to kill him, using an identity of a blind monk seeking shelter at solar of La Valette Castle. He was aware of a political situation and knew that, eventually, Temerian monarch would besiege the castle in hope of regaining his children, Boussy and Anais La Valette, back. This happened on April 1271, and when Foltest walked to the solar and turned his back to a monk in pray, he cut him down and even Geralt was not quick enough to help the king.
Attempt to kill Henselt.
Letho then sent two witchers, Serrit and Auckes, to assassinate King Henselt, hoping to further pin the murders on the sorceresses as well. They prepared for some time but were ultimately unsuccessful. Auckes was killed by Geralt while Serrit narrowly escaped.
Legacy.
As a result of their actions, at least two kings were murdered leaving Aedirn and Temeria in turmoils over a succession. During the Summit at Loc Muinne, mages, Lodge of Sorceresses in particular, were framed as the ones who hired "the mysterious assassins" and soon after witch hunts ensued.
After the deaths of most its members, the organization was dismissed and ceased to exist, with Imperator abandoning his promise of rebuilding the southern witcher school as soon as it was possible.

Four Kingdoms

The Four Kingdoms, or The Great Kingdoms, is the collective term used to refer to the ensemble of the significant countries on the Continent prior to the Second Northern War with Nilfgaard in the late 1260s. The hub of the lands of the North are composed of four large kingdoms — Kaedwen, Temeria, Redania, and Aedirn. They are the prime players in the great game of politics and war that decides the fate of kingdoms and dynasties.

Gors Velen marketplace

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
The marketplace on Kardo Street in Gors Velen is the prime trade district of the city, noisier and certainly much larger than the bustling fish market, it contains food and wares of all sorts from all over the known world, and exotic animals such as camels.
Musicians are known to play their fiddles and pipes to the whole market, and the stall owners are diverse, being human merchants, dwarven blacksmiths, and even half-elf, gnomish and halfling craftsman. Against the city walls lie tents considered to sell the "less savoury" items.
History.
Falka's Rebellion.
In 1154, the sorceress Rayli unleashed a fire elemental in the marketplace, killing several people. The monsters rampage was ended by Erland of Larvik and his friends, Nylah and Vaz. While the latter two took care of Rayli, the witcher killed the elemental.
Interwar Period.
Sometime between 1263 and 1266, Yennefer of Vengerberg was at the market, where she saw Yarpen Zigrin, and lost her temper due to their history. He fled from the city, with Yennefer shouted curses at him.
Ciri's Visit.
In late June 1267, while sight-seeing throughout the city, Ciri and Fabio Sachs visited the market and bought themselves doughnuts from a stall. They then saw a barker advertising a "real Zerrikanian basilisk" on display. Unable to resist, they payed their fare and entered to see the show. It didn't take long for Ciri to realize is was no basilisk, but a small and rather dirty wyvern trapped in a cage rather too small to hold it.
Unable to contain herself, Ciri starts making rather snide comments for all to hear and is soon the center of attention, something Yennefer had specifically asked her to beware not to do. One thing leads to another and the young witcher goes up on the stage to prove that the animal in the cage is no basilisk by standing close enough for it to "breathe its deadly venomous breath" on her. Since there seems to be no way to dissuade her, Fabio accompanies her onto the stage, as does a young squire, much to the dismay of the young woman he is escorting.
While the three are on stage, the cage suddenly gives way and the wyvern is freed. Ciri quickly puts her training into action, takes the sword off the young (and still stunned) squire and makes quick work of the beast, slicing off both its head and its tail before returning the sword. The panicked crowd, believing that the squire had dealt with the wyvern gather round to congratulate the young man.
Realizing that she has likely gone too far and made herself the center of attention, Ciri decides to make herself scarce. She orders Fabio to get out of the tent and meet her on the other side of the marketplace. Meanwhile, she activates the magic stone Yennefer had given her in case of emergency and makes her way out of the tent invisibly. It is the activation of the stone that catches the attention of Tissaia and Margarita.
The two sorceresses happen to be in town trying to track down a group of students who recently escaped Aretuza. They mistakenly assume that since she used magic, Ciri must be one of the escapees. Only a trip back to the bank and the word of Yennefer convinces them otherwise.

Geralt starts the game with one moon rune. Later, they can be purchased from a number of merchants, including the mysterious merchant, Haggard or Thorak in Vergen, or Falas, the Incredible Lockhart or Polycarp of Rinde during Chapter III.
To use a rune, Geralt simply drags it over to one of the rune slots on a suitable sword in the inventory panel.
Moon runes can also be used to craft , or , though given that the price of a rune is significantly higher than that of a piece of ore, it seems a poor use of the rune.

Earth runes can also be used to craft , though given that the price of an earth rune is eight times that of a piece of ore, it seems a poor use of the rune.

Raven was one of the first and most legendary witchers.
Biography.
Hailing from the School of the Griffin, Raven would descend into the Northern Realms each spring and summer. His renown began after he lifted a lycanthropy curse from the Duke of Maribor. Following this, the common folk spread tales of Raven slaying vicious Cyclopses and battling deadly Manticores. However, Raven's crowning achievement came when the Hoog Clan of Mahakam summoned him for a perilous contract.
The Mahakam dwarves had long been troubled by a massive Draconid they called the "Black Drake." Mahakam defenders, legendary dwarven heroes, and mercenary bands had all tried and failed to kill the beast. Eventually, the clans decided to leave the Drake alone. However, after a massive meteorite crashed into the peaks where the Drake resided, they sought the aid of a witcher.
Upon Raven's arrival, he requested that the forge masters craft him a special armor to protect him from the Drake's deadly attacks. In response, they forged a sleek, black suit of armor, dwarf-made and finished by gnomes. Before Raven could wear the armor, he was approached by the elven songsmith, Tyen'sail, who had been in Mahakam seeking inspiration. Tyen'sail was captivated by the new armor and asked Raven if he could weave ancient legends and enchantments of bravery and power into it. Raven agreed, and Tyen'sail worked tirelessly for twelve days, etching the armor while singing songs of power and victory.
With his newly enchanted armor, Raven confronted the Black Drake and defeated it in a fierce battle. He brought the Drake's head back as proof of his victory and collected his reward before continuing his journey. Tyen'sail later composed a song to commemorate Raven's heroic battle.
Legacy.
After Raven's death, he was buried in his armor, along with his witcher Steel sword and his Moonblade, in a crypt located in the Swamp cemetery near Vizima. The inscription on his tomb reads:
"Here lies the witcher known as Raven - a great warrior and defender of the weak. Honored be his name."
Witchers from various schools would hear of Raven's legendary deeds and equally legendary armor during their training. One of them, witcher Berengar, became obsessed with finding the armor. He searched crypts and tombs, hoping to discover it. While exploring a crypt near the lakeshore at Murky Waters, Berengar encountered fellow Wolf witcher, Geralt of Rivia. Berengar told Geralt about the armor, piquing Geralt’s interest. Determined to find it, Geralt eventually located Raven's crypt and retrieved a piece of the armor, along with the Notes of an elven minstrel, a fragment of Count Kobus de Ruyter's armor, and a magic formula. He brought these items to Kalkstein, who then reforged the armor.

Biography.
When he was just six years old, a brick fell on his head which made his speech somewhat defect. However, he could still provide a lot of information about the swamp.
At some point between 1270 and 1272, he moved to a small village south of Byways in Velen and at times reminisced about brickworks near Vizima.

The Pinto gang was a group of robbers and horse thieves commanded by Pinto.
Biography.
In August 1267, whilst in Loredo, a village in Geso, they encountered the fellow gang known as the Rats. The Pinto-allied tall man with a mustache made sexual jokes about two of their members, Ciri and Mistle, whilst his fellow gang members applauded and chanted. When he tried to harass them sexually, Ciri killed him, in a flash cutting his throat with two strokes of her sword. Giselher, the ringleader of the Rats, interceded before another member was killed. Scornfully, he paid Pinto one thaler by the pound for the dead bandit.

Tuzik was a peasant who lived with his daughter Milena in a small village in Geso.
Biography.
In August 1267, when the gang known as the Rats traveled through their village and patronisingly tossed coins at the villagers' feet, Tuzik was the only one not desperate enough to join in on the humiliating spectacle. He disdained the hypocrisy of his fellow villagers who had previously reviled the criminals' deeds only to burst into praise when they received a pittance. When he gave them a hard stare, one of the members Falka angrily rushed him on horseback, pressing him against the fence, only stopped by another member Mistle.
Later that afternoon, a unit of horsemen from Fen Aspra on the trail of the Rats, arrived in the village. They asked the villagers for clues but the locals denied having ever seen them. Tuzik mused that had one of the soldiers asked him, he would have revealed the truth. He then went to the cartwright Zgarba's house to find Milena playing with her twin girls, while dressed like the Rat, Falka. His distain for the gang led him to beat his daughter for the first time.

Reynard Odo was a member of the royal entourage of Queen Meve of Lyria and Rivia, as well as one of her most faithful advisers during the Second Northern War.
Biography.
Before the war, at the age of 20, Reynard enlisted and served under King Reginald of Rivia as a lieutenant. Not properly earning his position with experience and wanting to prove himself, Reynard began to spout off about the king's poor decisions publicly. As a result, a superior officer reported Reynard and he was charged with lèse-majesté, the crime of offence against a reigning sovereign or state. At his trial, he was found guilty of treason and sentenced to hang for his crimes, however Reginald delayed the execution and asked he repeat every word Reynard had said against him, which he did. Reginald agreed with the offensive comments, and appointed Reynard his personal aide, seeing potential in the man.
In 1259, when Reginald died, he started serving under his wife, Queen Meve.
In 1267, when Nilfgaardian troops under General Ardal aep Dahy invaded Lyria, he took part in the Battle of Dravograd, where Queen Meve defeated the invaders and saved the city of Dravograd.
When the queen however returned in the capital, she was victim of a conspiracy against her organized by Count Caldwell and by her own son Villem, who was placed on the throne in her place and later surrendered the country to Ardal aep Dahy.
Both the queen and Reynard were imprisoned but fortunately they were freed by Gascon and the Strays of Spalla before dawn, when Count Caldwell planned to kill them both.
Together with Reynard and Gascon, the queen fled from the city and traveled through Aedirn, Mahakam and Angren recruiting soldiers for her new army in order to take her kingdom back.
In Angren, the queen's army was forced to face a Nilfgaardian division named Morteisen Battle Group on Red Lobinden's bridge on the Yaruga river. During the battle, even Geralt and Cahir participated.
After the Battle for the Bridge he introduced Geralt to his queen because she wanted to knight the man who defended the bridge against the Morteisen Battle Group and led the Lyrians against the Nilfgaardians. Meve was seriously injured in her face during the fight and she lost several teeth. Hence she could not recite the accolade formula. Odo did that in the name of the queen, but the knightship was given to Geralt from Queen Meve. Geralt was now granted the right to call himself "Geralt of Rivia".
After the Battle for the Bridge, Reynard helped Meve in freeing Rivia from the Nilfgaardian occupation, until the Queen's army finally arrived at the City of Rivia, where General Ardal aep Dahy himself placed his main headquarters. After a brief meeting between Meve and Ardal aep Dahy, the Queen started besieging the city castle.
"If Reynard survives the battle:" In the end, Queen Meve managed to free the city and thus her country.
With General aep Dahy's death at the Second battle of Aldersberg and later the Peace of Cintra, the war finally ended. Meve started ruling over Lyria and Rivia again with an iron hand and with Reynard at her side, no longer though as a general or as an advisor, since he had become to the queen something more.
"If Reynard dies in the battle:" Before the battle started however, Meve tasked Reynard and a small group of experienced soldiers with crossing at night the lake beneath the city wall and infiltrating the castle, in order to open the portcullis and allow the other troops to enter.
Although Reynard accomplished his task, he unfortunately remained killed in the action. His sacrifice however wasn't vain, as Queen Meve finaly managed to free the city and thus her country.
After the war's end, Reynard was buried in the chapel of Rivia Castle, laid alongside the tombs of famous Dukes and Kings. Droves of his faithful soldiers bid him farewell, while Queen Meve herself brought flowers on his shrine each day.

Vernon Roche was the commander of the Blue Stripes, special forces of the Temerian military. Being Temerian, he held his king, Foltest, in high regard. He was also a capable fighter.
Early life.
Vernon Roche never met his father. He spent his childhood living in poverty. Having no money to live on, his mother was forced to work as a prostitute on the streets. Because of that, other children used to fling insults at him, calling him "whoreson"; since that time, Roche reacts aggressively to this particular insult.
Vernon admits that, if not for King Foltest, he would have ended up on the streets either as a vagabond or a drunkard.
Roche has served for four years with the Blue Stripes unit. For his devotion and efficiency he was decorated twice with the Order of Bravery. He was also a veteran from the Battle of Brenna.
According to Iorveth, he is responsible for the annihilation of many elves, women and children among them. Roche also led the "pacification" of Mahakam.
Because of his capability, he became Foltest's right hand man and had a great deal of power and influence in Vizima.
In the prologue, he interrogates Geralt about Foltest's killer, and begins to believe that Geralt had nothing to do with the assassination of Foltest. An unnamed 'contact' later revealed as Dandelion provides information about the real Kingslayer's whereabouts.
At the start of Chapter I, Roche, Geralt and Triss encounter Iorveth, who attacks them due to the ongoing hostility between the Scoia'tael and the Blue Stripes. After saving Zoltan Chivay and Dandelion, Roche and his men occupy a building next to the inn. While Geralt is off performing tasks, Roche continues his hunt for Iorveth and the Kingslayer, culminating in a three-way battle between the Scoia'tael, the Blue Stripes, and Letho. During this battle, Geralt has the option of freeing Iorveth and returning his sword or siding with Vernon and the Blue Stripes. Failing to help him leads to Iorveth's capture by Roche. If you choose to side with Roche in Chapter I, you will lead an infiltration attempt to kill Flotsam's corrupt and treacherous Commandant.
In Chapter II, Roche is revealed to be behind a conspiracy against King Henselt. After the conspiracy is discovered, King Henselt on the advice of mage, Dethmold, orders the execution of the entire Blue Stripes, except for Ves, whom Henselt rapes. Geralt and Roche escape the Kaedweni camp to intercept Síle in Vergen, which is under siege by Henselt's Army. The Sorceress manages to escape the city but Henselt and his Royal Guard, who were also looking for her, are defeated by Geralt. Roche is then either convinced that killing Henselt would only aid the Kingslayers and make him just as much a murderer as they are or allowed by Geralt to kill Henselt in revenge for the execution of the Blue Stripes.
In Chapter III, Roche is one of the few remaining men still able to act in the interests of Temeria, and seeks to prevent the dissolution of his country at Loc Muinne. Vouching for Geralt, he manages to get the witcher access to the city, past the Order of the Flaming Rose even if Geralt sided against them.
Meeting with Radovid V, Roche discovers that Anaïs La Valette was captured by Dethmold and agrees to rescue her and deliver her to Radovid. If Geralt decides to aid him, Roche will either keep his word to Radovid and deliver Foltest's bastard child to him, in which case he dons the Redanian colors and declares he will serve Radovid as the latter turns Temeria into a protectorate believing it the best way to protect Foltest's legacy, or he will be persuaded by Geralt to send Anaïs to John Natalis, in which case he will do his best to protect her and Temeria will remain independent. Either way, Dethmold is brutally murdered by Roche.
Should Geralt decide to save Triss, then Roche will successfully rescue Anaïs on his own but will be unable to kill Dethmold, in which case Temeria will either be divided between Redania and Kaedwen, if Henselt remains alive, or fall into civil war.
"There is a man like Vernon Roche in every monarch's retinue. Brave and determined, ready to execute any command, and thoroughly hated at court, he knows that only allegiance and service to the king keep him in his position. Roche was the leader of the Blue Stripes - King Foltest's special forces - renowned, among other things, for battling the Scoia'tael and quelling many a rebellious nonhuman community. It was under his command that the unit rose to fame. Vernon earned Foltest's favor and trust through his deeds. One word from the King and he would jump headlong into fire, asking only how long he was to stay there and hold his ground. That's the kind of man Vernon Roche was at the time."
 "Vernon proved to be perceptive when he refused to flatly believe Geralt's guilt. Too many things needed to be explained, and the Blue Stripes' commander decided risking cooperation with the suspect to get his hands on Foltest's real killer. Thus he remained loyal to his king even after his death."
 "Continuing his private investigation, Vernon headed for the Temerian-Aedernian border, where he expected to find clues the kingslayer's whereabouts. Thanks to his very best informant, Roche knew that the man could have been hiding among the Scoia'tael located in the vicinity of Flotsam, a trading post. Thus way the royal hound, Vernon Roche, was on the hunt once more..."
 "The list of Vernon Roche's achievements and heroic deeds was almost as long as the list of the atrocities and depravities he had allegedly committed along the way. It is a fact that, as the scrawlings on the wall of the University of Oxenfurt say:"Pacifying nonhumans is like wallowing in mud – everyone gets dirty, generally with blood.""
If Geralt chooses to help Roche in Ruined elven baths :
 "It is hard to please men such as Roche. However, capturing Iorveth had the Blue Stripes' commander practically beaming with joy."
If Geralt chooses to help Iorveth in elven ruins:
 "To put it mildly, Roche was irritated with Geralt's decision and his trust in the witcher did not grow."
If Geralt chooses Roche's path during the end of chapter I:
 "Vernon was a man of action. When he learned of Loredo's treason, he crafted a bold plan to remove him from office."
 "Roche achieved his goal, getting rid of the blackguard Bernard Loredo. The Blue Stripes' captain did not forget the witcher's help. From that moment on Geralt and Vernon became allies through thick and thin."
 "Roche was behind the conspiracy against Henselt. The plan to weaken the Kaedweni ruler's position had been formed back when Foltest was still alive, and Vernon was one of its architects. It placed him in a very risky position, but the captain of Temeria's Special Forces kept his cool."
 "After the conspiracy was revealed and his men massacred by Henselt, there was no turning back for Vernon – he had become a wanted criminal in Kaedwen. He decided to settle the score with Dethmold and Henselt no matter the cost – yet he did not forget his primary goal."
If Geralt chooses to let Roche kill Henselt during the end of Chapter II:
 "When Fate placed the king of Kaedwen in his hands, Vernon used them to kill Henselt. Thus he demonstrated the weight of his threats and the distance he would go in order to settle his scores."
If Geralt chooses to stop Roche from killing Henselt during the end of chapter II:
 "Fate placed the king of Kaedwen at his mercy, yet Vernon chose not to stoop to using the same tactics as the kingslayers. Though his hand itched, this cold professional knew how to keep his emotions at bay."
 "The Blue Stripes' captain wanted to settle scores with the kingslayer and Dethmold. Thus he left with Geralt for Loc Muinne to close the final chapter of this story."
If Geralt chooses to rescue Triss Merigold during Chapter III:
 "There they split up – Vernon left to square things with Dethmold. Taking into account the determination previously displayed by the commander of Foltest's Special Forces, I wouldn't have bet a wooden nickel on the magician. As it turned out, my instincts were right."
If Geralt chooses to rescue Anaïs La Valette during Chapter III:
 "Vernon Roche always settled his accounts – the Kaedweni king's pet sorcerer learned that the hard way. The Temerian captain made good on his promise and avenged the deaths of his men – now only the question of the kingslayer remained unanswered."
If Anaïs is handed over to Radovid V:
 "Vernon felt the burden of great responsibility when he freed Anaïs La Valette, the heir to the Temerian throne. He acknowledged Radovid's arguments and decided to serve his country's interests by supporting the Redanian king and placing the girl under his care."
If Geralt convinces Roche to hand Anaïs over to John Natalis:
 "Vernon felt the burden of great responsibility when he freed Anaïs La Valette, the heir to the Temerian throne. He felt, however, that the kingdom's interests required him to support John Natalis, so he placed the girl under his care. Thus he remained loyal to the Temerian crown."
If Geralt chooses Iorveth's path during the end of chapter I:
 "Because of his contacts with the Scoia'tael, Geralt lost the chance to work with Vernon Roche. Their ways parted."
 "Vernon's help was as unexpected as it was invaluable. Even though Geralt stood with his opponents, Roche helped the witcher, saving him from certain death. Furthermore, he did so out of kindness, thus proving that tales of his callousness are somewhat exaggerated."
 "Roche not only provided him with valuable information, but also risked his neck, helping him to acquire royal blood. Though Geralt had not sided with him fully earlier, Vernon trusted that the witcher would be able to get to Foltest's murderer. Though that meeting was to be their last, at least in this story, Geralt never forgot the debt he owed the Blue Stripes' captain."
Journal entry.
In the immediate aftermath of the events at Loc Muinne, Vernon Roche raced out to the front line and joined the 2nd Temerian Army under Natalis' command where they held defensive positions on the Dol Blathanna - Mount Carbon line in preparation for the coming Nilfgaardian invasion. However, after three days, the Nilfgaardian soldiers smashed through their lines and the Temerians scattered. Upon hearing of King Radovid's call to arms near Novigrad and promises to fight for a free North, Roche took the remaining forces and fought through to the west, breaking into the Pontar Delta in the hopes of attracting Redanian support. Alas, to his despair, Radovid was no different from Emperor Emhyr and thus he turned to guerrilla warfare.
Still wanting to secure a free Temeria, he struck up an alliance with former Redanian spymaster Sigismund Dijkstra and former Temerian spymaster, Thaler. Realising that Radovid meant no hope for Temerian sovereignty, the group began plotting his assassination. In addition, Roche began contact with Nilfgaard, who promised to make Temeria an independent, vassal state to the empire in return for killing Radovid and stopping guerrilla attacks on its forces. Thus, Roche had his men undermine Redanian support in the area while not attacking Nilfgaardian troops. Likewise, Nilfgaardian troops were also ordered to leave the guerrilla soldiers be, supposedly under the pretext that they weren't much of a threat anymore.
When Geralt started looking for Whoreson Junior in the area, Dijkstra sent him to Roche, who was now camping out in a large cave near Oxenfurt. After conversing for a bit, Roche then informed Geralt he had some luck, as he was about to head out to speak to an informant who might know more about Whoreson Junior. In Oxenfurt, Roche showed that his informant was none other than King Radovid V. After a conversation with the king, Geralt and Roche then left, with Roche saying that Radovid was sinking further into insanity and asking for the witcher to drop by as he needed help with something.
Later, after the mages successfully escape Novigrad, Roche meets Geralt in the Passiflora with Dijkstra. They reveal their plan to assassinate Radovid, and that a contact of theirs who is essential to the plan hasn't reported back; this contact turns out to be Thaler, the former Head of Temerian Intelligence.
The personal matter that Roche needed assistance with turned out to be Ves, who was openly defying Roche's orders and attacking a Nilfgaardian encampment without his approval. If Geralt agrees to assist Roche, they find Ves about to ambush an execution of the citizens of Mulbrydale. After killing the Nilfgaardians and saving Ves, Roche and Ves get into an argument over her disobedience. Geralt can offer his opinion. While they argue, they find that a Nilfgaardian officer survived. The two argue over whether they execute him or not, and again, Geralt offers his input.
If you helped Roche with dealing with Ves, he can be recruited to assist in the battle at Kaer Morhen against the Wild Hunt. Roche agrees, and says he will head over immediately, once he gets some important matters taken care of.
When you return to Kaer Morhen with Ciri, you have the option to engage in dialogue with Roche and Ves about the keep, the status of the guerillas, and what they think the outcome of the war will be. If Letho of Gulet was brought to the battle, it will instead be triggered as an automatic cutscene. The conversation will proceed as normal, until Letho interrupts it, commenting he's found some "old friends". Roche and Ves are angry at Geralt for bringing the man who killed Foltest to the keep, and refuse to speak to him.
Later, when Geralt goes to retrieve Philippa Eilhart, if he does not break Djikstra's leg, he can optionally take part in the assassination, alongside Roche his guerillas.
"If Radovid is not assassinated:" Radovid's forces defeat Nilfgaard and all of the Northern Realms, including Temeria, are annexed by Redania. Roche's fate is unknown.
"If Radovid is assassinated:" When Radovid goes to retrieve Philippa as part of a ruse, he sentences Geralt to death, saying his sarcasm and dry wit irritate him, and that he's killed people for much less. When the executioner asks Geralt for "any last words", a Temerian guerilla strikes the soldier in the back with an arrow, after which Roche and his men attack. They battle Radovid's men until they find the king banging on a door. Philippa then appears, blinds Radovid and stabs him in the back, shocking Roche.
They later meet at the theater, where they discuss their next steps. Thaler reveals the deal he had made with Nilfgaard to secure Temerian sovereignty, before Dijkstra arrives. Dijkstra reveals his betrayal, stating that the deal meant giving the rest of the Northern Realms to Emhyr and was unwise. He continues, angering Roche further by saying that he'll fight for the North and unite all the kingdoms under Redania after defeating the invader, as his henchmen surround the group. Relying on the Witcher's neutrality, Dijkstra persuades Geralt to leave.
"If Geralt intervenes:" Geralt refuses to allow Dijkstra to kill Roche, Ves and Thaler. The group defeat Dijkstra and his men, after which Roche tells Geralt that he'll be received with honours in Vizima for his help. As a result of this, the Northern Realms are left leaderless and the Nilfgaardian Empire win the Third Northern War. As promised, Temeria becomes an independent state, while the rest of the Northern Realms are conquered by Nilfgaard.
"If Geralt does not intervene:" Pledging neutrality, Geralt doesn't get involved and leaves the theatre. Roche and Ves and Thaler are subsequently killed by Dijkstra's men, and Dijkstra takes command of Redania's forces. In consequence, the Nilfgaardian Empire are defeated and Redania conquers the rest of the Northern Realms.
"As commander of Temerian Special Forces - an elite squadron known as the "Blue Stripes" - Vernon Roche had been one of King Foltest's most trusted subordinates. Time and time again Roche proved himself loyal, effective and a thorough professional. Few could match his skill at subduing revolves, fighting off Nilfgaardians or snuffing out bands of Scoia'tael."
"At the start of our story, however, he had lost his king, his men and his homeland, and so had resorted to waging a guerilla war against the overwhelmingly occupying forces."
"In his war of assassinations, ambushes and night raids, Roche depended on Redanian help, though it was clear he took no pleasure from working with Radovid."
"Some time later it was revealed that Roche had took part in a conspiracy to assassinate Radovid. He had realized that once the war was over this mad king would offer no prospect of a free Temeria, making Roche himself a liability and a potential foe."
If Vernon takes part in the assassination:
"Roche took part in the assassination personally. The king of Redania's death was to be a guarantee of Temerian independence. In order to achieve this, Roche was not afraid to strike a deal with the Nilfgaardians. This move played right into Dijkstra's hand."
If Geralt does not intervene, letting Dijkstra kill the others:
"Geralt, refusing to get involved in their conflict, left them to work it out for themselves. As a result, Roche died at Dijkstra's orders."
If Geralt does intervene, killing Dijkstra:
"Fortunately, Geralt intervened and Roche escaped from the co-conspirators' meeting-turned-bloodbath."
If Geralt asks Vernon for help fighting the Wild Hunt:
"When asked to help defend Kaer Morhen Roche kept his word and went to the keep, lending his considerable martial prowess in the fight against the Wild Hunt."

Flotsam is a town situated on the border between Temeria and Aedirn and was administrated by Bernard Loredo in 1271.
"Flotsam, a river port and trading post, lies along the upper course of the Pontar, among inaccessible forests in the valley that bears the river's name. Numerous trade routes meet here, and the Temerian-Aedirnian border is located nearby. Land travel in the region was arduous and dangerous, for Scoia'tael units prowled the woods. However, as they say, "elves, like cats, are shy of water", so most travellers and merchants chose to sail the river. Flat-bottomed barges, punts, scows, and even seagoing cogs visited the harbor, ferrying goods between Aedirn, Kaedwen, Temeria, Redania, and Cidaris on the seashore. No wonder, then, that this ostensibly small outpost was of vital economic importance. He who controlled it drew immense profits from trade. At the start of our story, Flotsam belonged to Temeria, and its small garrison was tasked with enforcing the law and providing protection from river pirates, Scoia'tael units and monsters inhabiting the surrounding forests."

School of the Griffin

"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
School of the Griffin, sometimes referred to as School of the Eagle or Gryphon School, is a school of witchers headquartered in Kovir and Poviss, in Kaer Seren located at the sea end of a mountain range. Leo Bonhart had reportedly slain at least one of its members.
History.
As the school of the bear, viper and cat were founded the Order of Witchers grew weaker. The witcher Erland of Larvik decided he would not let the original purpose and ideals of the Order fade away. Together with 13 of his closest friends they amicably left the remains of the Order. They then travelled east to Kaer Seren. It was a fortress previously used by Alzur and his associates in the early tests for creating witchers. As the fortress stood upon a confluence of air magic, the spirits of the failed experiments haunted the place. After having dealt with the spirits, the school of the Griffin began.
The Griffins kept the original "knightly" values of the witcher order. Erland was inspired by the ideals of his old sword teacher, Taliesin Bleddyn Yorath aep Lywelyn, whom the witchers called Gryphon. In honour of him and his teachings the school was named the School of the Griffin. Together with their head sorcerer they created a new discipline, one that focused on magic, preparedness, and flexibility. They also taught their students proper etiquette. Griffin witchers were taught that they had a purpose and brothers who would support them. The older witchers stood as examples for the others. When a boy died during his training he was given a proper burial in a graveyard. 
At the height of their power the Griffin witchers enjoyed great respect, with the school's grandmaster even being summoned to the courts of rulers to give advice. Like the school of the Bear and Wolf, the Griffins maintained a strict neutrality, even refusing to help Kovir and Poviss fight against attacking Redania and Kaedwen. They reasoned that once a witcher breaks his neutrality he can never go back. Unlike the other schools they had nothing against killing dragons.
The school used to possess important magic books in its library including the "Liber Tenebrarum" beloved by Old Keldar. Throughout the ages, the other schools respected the Griffins for their study of magic and their fighting style that emphasized facing multiple opponents. Unfortunately, a group of mages became angry because of the Griffins' unwillingness to share their knowledge; when anti-witcher sentiments grew they caused an avalanche in revenge killing several witchers and badly damaging Kaer Seren. Probably because of this, Coën was forced to spend winters in Kaer Morhen instead of his home keep. Even after the school's fall, there were villages in the north where the deeds of the Griffin witchers were celebrated.
Training.
Students are offered two choices to complete their final trial. They either locate and retrieve a griffin's egg, or recite the entirety of Liber Tenebrarum verbatim. However, none have ever chosen the latter.
Characteristics.
Griffin School equipment is of medium weight and amplifies the intensity of the wearer's Signs; as such, it is heavily implied that the school and its disciples may have specialized in the use of magic. Griffin witchers may also possess higher standards of social etiquette compared to other schools, which was mentioned in the Dragonslayer's treasure hunt quest, though this might have referred to George specifically.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
One of the Four Prime Elements or Principles, Water is often associated with emotions. Its fluidity and moderate mechanics often make Water the entry point for beginners learning to control elemental Power.
Elemental Plane of Water.
The Elemental Plane of Water, also called the Dimension of Water or the Water Plane, is a strange universe that consists entirely of the Water Principle. While the Plane itself has been out of the reach of natives of the Material Plane since the time of Conjunction, its energy permeates the material world through ley lines referred to as "water veins". The elemental Water manifests most strongly at the intersections of ley lines, which occur in those areas of physical world where mundane waters meet, such as river junctions and deltas, or in caverns in the ocean's depths.
The Dimension is inhabited by a variety of water elementa, the most powerful of which being marides, the genies of Water. When summoned to the material reality, marides act as living reservoirs of Water magical energy and can create tsunamis or disastrous rainfall. Records exist of powerful sorcerers having forced marides to serve them; less powerful water elementals are also described as quite manageable by mages. A variety of water elementals, ice elementals, somehow occur in the material world naturally, at intersections situated in particularly frosted areas.
Para-Elemental Plane of Ice.
As the Water Principle can manifest itself in form of the para-Element of Ice, some groups of mages and elves speculate about the existence of the para-Elemental Plane of Ice.
If elven legends are to be believed, when the Winter Queen learnt about the incoming White Frost from the Ithlinne's Prophecy she travelled to the heart of this para-Plane in order to learn the essence of the menace in the very place of its (supposed) origin. Neither the Aen Saevherne magic nor her knowledge stopped the inevitable. The gene of the Elder Blood, however, was strong enough to moderate the effects of this alien reality and save the elf's life. The experience woke a power within her, allowing the Queen to bend time and space to her will; the gift's price was a perceptible aura of iciness around her, cold touch, and aversion to warmth.
Water magic.
Water—Due to its moderate dynamics, water is the optimal medium for inexperienced sorcerers to learn to channel the Power. As with the other elements, any concentration or manifestation of water can be used as a source of magical energy. However, it is best to start by drawing from water veins, preferably from their intersections—the most widespread Places of Power. Easily detectable by even the least experienced adepts, and isolated from most external influences, intersections are a relatively safe source of the Power. In time, a sorcerer will be able to learn how to draw energy from the many variable and mercurial manifestations of the element of water—for a calm lake requires a different approach than a rapidly flowing stream. The sea, on account of its dynamism, is a particularly troublesome source. Despite its vast stores of energy, drawing upon it is best left to more experienced sorcerers. "The World of the Witcher"
The Water Principle often serves as an introduction to magic, as its veins and intersections are both widespread and relatively safe to draw from. It is best suited for spells that manipulate water and ices, as well as those that affect thoughts and emotions.
In case of overexerting oneself while casting a Water spell, the caster is subjected to noticeable cold and a noticeable icy glaze might form around their body; overdrawing from Water can also induce vivid hallucinations.
A common witcher Sign utilizing this element is Axii, which is used to manipulate a mind of self or another living being.

Sources of Power

In order to use magic one has to use Power. Several possible sources are listed below.
Element as a source.
There are four Primary Elements (and unknown number of Para-Elements) sourced in elemental planes. Manifesting themselves in the world through Intersections (places of Power) they are the basic sources of Power. While most of the spells work best if use one specific element, casting them utilising another is still possible though hard.
Quintessence or Mixed Elements.
The most complicated spells base on Ether, or Spirit. Mages who want to cast them must either draw to its plane, called Ether, or mix the Primary Elements.
Black Magic.
Though banned by the Brotherhood of Sorcerers the forbidden arts still lure practitioners due to the possibilities they offer.

&lt;/infobox&gt;Aryan La Valette was the son of Maria Louisa La Valette and "Old Baron La Valette" and the half-brother of Anaïs and Boussy.
Aryan initially appeared during the castle assault part of the Prologue, where Geralt can kill him and his men, duel him to the death or force him to surrender.
Should Geralt choose to kill him, that is the end of their interaction.
If he surrenders during his encounter with Geralt, he appears in the quest The Dungeons of the La Valettes where he is a fellow prisoner in the castle dungeon, and later still, in Chapter III, Geralt encounters him again in Loc Muinne.
He would later return to La Valette Castle and when Nilfgaard started the Third Northern War by attacking Sodden and Brugge turned his lands into a safe haven in the north.
 "Baroness La Valette's eldest child, Aryan, was beyond all doubt her and the old baron's son. Raised to be a knight, he sought to uphold the virtues of this state, valuing courage and valor, and striving by his every deed to embody them. He must have felt extreme discomfort by the conflict that engulfed him, as at its roots lay his mother's and family's honor, pitted against widely discussed rumors of a love affair between the Baroness and King Foltest. Though the situation was dire, the young knight valiantly commanded the defense of his family's castle, intending to give not an inch of ground."
If Geralt persuades him to surrender during the Prologue:
"Seeing that further resistance was hopeless, Aryan yielded, laid down his arms and placed himself at the king's mercy."
"Unfortunately, he could not count on it after Foltest's death, and only Geralt's intervention saved him from torture and disgrace."
"Honor prevented the proud youth from fleeing his family seat while it was in enemy hands. Aryan made a decision that meant certain death for himself, but he nevertheless made it without hesitation, sealing with his sacrifice the bloodiest chapter ever in La Valette family annals."
"Imagine the witcher's surprise when he learned that the heroic youth had survived after all and then turned to King Radovid of Redania for help in finding his sister, Anaïs."
If Geralt kills him and his men during the Prologue:
"Faced with a choice, Aryan preferred to die leading his men in battle than to stain his honor by yielding to Foltest."
If Geralt duels him during the Prologue:
"Seeking to save his soldiers' lives, Aryan decided to do or die. He faced the witcher in a duel and died by his hand."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;The kayran is a boss monster from the first chapter of "" and is found near the small town of Flotsam. It is the first major boss-fight in the game.
Killing the monster is the object of the quest The Kayran.
 "The kayran stands apart among all creatures, large and small, beautiful and horrible: It is unique, not alike any other being. Doubtless it is a post-conjunction creature that appeared in our reality in the time when worlds intermingled. It took up residence in the Pontar's waters, where it lives to this day. The chronicles mention instances when the kayran appeared on the river's surface in various places over the ages. There is no certainty whether it is the same creature slowly moving up and down the river, or perhaps his progeny seen here and there."
 "Over a hundred years ago the kayran made its lair near the trading post of Flotsam. The folk of the nearby village call it the Old Man. People have grown used to the monster's presence. Until recently, they even considered it harmless. Lately, however, the kayran awoke and now emerges from the water. It has become aggressive: It shatters ships, shreds nets, snatches people from the river-banks, and pulls them beneath the water. Even the military cannot handle this plague, for the kayran hides in the water, where it is impossible to fight."
 "To defeat the kayran, one first needs to pull it onto dry land or drain the river meander where the monster lies in wait. If that trick works, it will be possible to approach the monstrosity. The creature defends itself with long, heavy tentacles - an ordinary man would die from a single blow, for these appendages weigh as much as a trebuchet-arm and are covered in poisonous mucus. These tentacles should be cut off or immobilized during combat, for example using a special trap. Once the kayran is unable to shield itself, one should approach its trunk - but beware its venom! The monster spits its vile poison as skillfully as a street-urchin. Its armor, tougher than that of any other creature - with the possible exception of dragons - is the final obstacle to overcome. One needs to find a way to pierce the carapace and get to the inner organs. Good luck!"
 "The kayran laughs at poisons, or it would laugh if it had a sense of humor. It might even fall over from laughter, and that would be the only way to knock it down, but it's not going to happen. If the creature had a circulatory system like humans do, it might be possible to bleed it to death. Unfortunately it is a monster that makes other monsters seem like house-pets, thus oils reducing blood-coagulation cannot harm it. It treats most traps as garbage strewn on the ground, but witchers may be able to construct traps to immobilize its tentacles."

Draug is an arch-wraith and the second boss monster which Geralt encounters in "". Every step he takes shakes the earth beneath Geralt's feet. He can also change form, taking the form of a firey tornado and can summon back up from ghastly archers and trebuchets.
It turns out that the draug is actually the wraith of "the Visitor", Vandergrift who led the Kaedweni forces in the previous battle between Kaedwen and Aedirn. But there are several more specters of this type, on other cursed battlefields and cemeteries.
When fighting the draug, its attack cannot be parried, and fast attack does negligible damage against it. Instead, use the strong attack. Also, if you attack from the front you must first break through its shield before damage can be dealt against its health bar, but if you attack from behind you can bypass the shield.
 "The draug is a mythical creature, straight from ancient legends of heroes and epic deeds. When the hero enters the burning hells to rescue his beloved, or when he has to avenge his father's death, the draug is often his opponent. Why are poets so keen to cast this monster as the arch-enemy? Well, the draug is a wraith, so it fits any dark story featuring a curse or vengeance from the beyond. There's no telling how what it actually looks like, so its terrifying visage can be described in many ways without risking accusation of confabulation. Furthermore, it is a powerful creature, a prince of the damned, so it makes an ideal villain."
 "As an arch-wraith, the draug never stoops to doing anything with its own hands. It has lackeys for that, always wraiths, revenants or other restless spirits. Having been a king or a commander in life, the draug retains its charisma in death, and its deathly subordinates always blindly obey its orders. Thus one needs to exterminate all manner servants on the way to its underground palace, wilderness keep or other foreboding abode. Only then can one face the draug itself. That's literary tradition for you."
 "The draug can be described in various ways, as has been said, but is always a lethal foe. Forget its huge strength, invulnerability to pain, fearlessness and bloodlust. One cannot just defeat a draug using conventional means. As with every wraith, there is some tragic event connected to it, forcing the creature to remain among the living. The draug is untouchable, unreachable for anyone who is not part of that story. That is why the mythical hero has to get involved in various brawls and pass through many trials. By overcoming these obstacles, he enters the draug's world and becomes worthy of facing the monstrosity."
 "The wraiths' leader is so powerful that it mocks simple witchers' tricks. The one sure thing in fighting the draug, it must be said, is a silver sword."

Bernard Loredo was the commandant of Flotsam that Geralt first encountered while attempting to rescue Dandelion and Zoltan Chivay from being hanged.
It is highly possible that he managed to take control of Flotsam thanks to his mother Marietta Loredo who was once a psychiatric patient on the local mental institution, more precisely the only patient that survived the fire of the same, she later killed the commander of the place by slitting the man's throat and proceeded to steal a map that revealed the location of a treasure which belonged to the Imperial Army of Nilfgaard.
"At the time of this story, Bernard Loredo was commandant of the town watch of the river port and trading post of Flotsam. He was well-suited to the position, amply demonstrating this through his brutal and heavy-handed approach to enforcing the law and meting out justice to the town. This boorish veteran of the Temerian army was perfectly happy with his posting to this backwoods, as he had turned the borderland settlement into a private fiefdom wich he ruled through fear and might, passing and executing judgment at whim. I was exceptionally lucky to escape the noose back then. Despite my deepest desire to the contrary, it would not be the last time we saw Bernard Loredo."
"In spite of maintaining a smokescreen of law and order in Flotsam, Loredo was as benevolent to nonhumans as Emperor Emhyr was to proponents of democracy. Given the slightest excuse, Bernard would have gladly rid the trading post and its environs of all who were not human, using any means available."
"Much evidence suggested that Loredo was profiting heftily from his position through extortion, unlawful confiscation of goods and brazen bribe-taking. He would enlist local goons to beat and intimidate all who were uncooperative, and this was very much the order of the day."
"Loredo yearned for some spectacular success in his fight against the Scoia'tael. Though his prison barge was overcrowded already, capturing Iorveth remained his deepest desire."
If Geralt sides with Roche during the end of Chapter I:
"We did not learn the full measure of Bernard Loredo's corruption and twisted decadence until we found the elven woman he had kidnapped and imprisoned in his residence. She had been treated with exceptional cruelty, she had been beaten and raped. The man truly deserved no mercy."
"To this day the people of Flotsam maintain that nothing less than a witcher could have rid them of the town's bestial, self-appointed ruler, Commandant Bernard Loredo. Though he could not match the kayran in size, he was without a doubt the greatest monster in the area. Many breathed a sigh of relief when the white-haired witcher sent him to the world beyond."
If Geralt sides with Iorveth during the end of Chapter I:
"This vile individual's duplicity, his fidelity to his purse alone, were apparent to anyone who paused to look at him. His sale of Flotsam, an important trading post, to the kingdom of Kaedwen was to be his crowning swindle. And the provincial ruffian cared little that it would also render him a traitor to his country."

Geralt's company

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Geralt's company (or hanza) consisted of Geralt, Dandelion, Milva, Cahir, Regis, and later, Angoulême.
History.
The group had originally formed shortly after escaping Fort Armeria, despite Geralt's protests over Cahir and Regis joining. Through a variety of events and information, the group began to head south, to Riverdell, in hopes of finding the druids Regis mentioned that could help find Ciri. However, while in Riedbrune, Geralt was informed by the city's new governor, Fulko Artevelde, that the Nightingale gang had been hired by a then unknown half-elf to kill the witcher. Seeing a chance to take out the gang, Fulko, under no uncertain terms, asked Geralt to take care of it lest he inform his superiors what the group was really up to. As part of the deal though, Geralt asked to have Angoulême join him under the pretense of her being knowledgeable about the group, as she'd been with them before running away. However, this was also done to save her life, as the information she gave was only to buy her an easier, quicker death at Fulko's hands.
And so, as night fell and the rest were informed about the Nightingale gang, they declared once more they were a hanza, committed to finding and rescuing Ciri, or at least getting revenge if she was dead. However, by October the group reached Toussaint and Dandelion, having been a former paramour of Duchess Anna Henrietta, soon rekindled their relationship and decided he was going to stay in Beauclair. Their mission was also jeopardized by Fringilla Vigo, a visiting sorceress and the duchess' cousin, who took a liking to Geralt to keep him in Toussaint until May under the Lodge of Sorceresses' orders, as they had their own plans laid out for Ciri. This worked until early January, when it became clear that Geralt still loved Yennefer and, on overhearing a conversation, learned exactly where Vilgefortz's hideout was. In a last ditch effort, Fringilla wooed the witcher one last time before he left, getting him to reveal the location. However, having not trusted the sorceress, Geralt actually gave her a false location before leaving Toussaint with his company, sans Dandelion.
The company, riding through a blizzard in the various mountain passes, eventually made their way to Stygga Castle in Ebbing and began their assault. While it initially went well, with most of the mercenaries running away, they soon faced heavy opposition that resulted in Milva and a rival archer firing at each other simultaneously, mortally wounding each other. Shortly after, Angoulême and Cahir found Ciri, who was being pursued by Leo Bonhart and mercenaries, with one of the latter stabbing Angoulême in the thigh. Cahir stayed behind to fight Bonhart while the two women took off, but the knight was soon slain by the bounty hunter and Angoulême died soon after from too much blood loss. Meanwhile Regis went to help Yennefer and Geralt, who were pinned down by Vilgefortz, and while he managed to save Yennefer's life, Regis was torn apart and melted down by Vilgefortz.
After Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer successfully dealt with the opposition, they buried the deceased members outside the castle.

Letho of Gulet, also known as The Kingslayer, was a witcher from the School of the Viper. His closest associates were Auckes, Serrit, and a fourth Viper—fellow kingslayers and witchers from the School of the Viper. Letho enlisted the help of Iorveth and the Scoia'tael to assist him in his plan to assassinate the kings of the Northern Kingdoms.
Biography.
Letho's origins are not well-documented, and it is unknown if he actually hailed from Gulet. As a child, he ended up at the School of the Viper, where he was trained, underwent the Trial of the Grasses, and became a witcher. Here, he was also educated in the school's repository of knowledge on the Wild Hunt.
After becoming a witcher, the Viper School eventually fell into ruin. The Usurper demanded the school's submission, and when they refused, the Nilfgaardian Army laid siege to and destroyed Gorthur Gvaed after a costly battle. The remaining witchers were scattered across the Empire, becoming internal exiles forbidden from entering most cities, forcing Letho and his brothers into hiding.
Letho once pursued a bounty on a wanted man named Louis in Aedirn. Struggling to find simple contracts, he decided to hunt Louis for the reward. He tracked Louis to the Golden Hanged Man in Hagge and captured him. However, when the guard post was closed until dawn, the two conversed and became friends, leading Letho to release him.
On July 25, 1270, in the forests of Angren, Letho was near death after being struck by a slyzard's tail. Geralt of Rivia, a witcher from the School of the Wolf, found and saved him while chasing the Wild Hunt to rescue Yennefer. In gratitude, Letho informed Geralt where to find the Wild Hunt and, alongside his companions, traveled with him to track down the spectral riders. They eventually caught up with the Wild Hunt on the Winter Solstice at the Hanged Man's Tree in Nilfgaard. Despite their skills, they couldn't defeat the spectral warriors, leading to a stalemate. Geralt then offered himself in exchange for Yennefer.
Respecting Geralt's sacrifice, Letho and his companions took care of Yennefer. However, she was suffering from amnesia, causing trouble for the group. While they traveled constantly to avoid attention, they were eventually detained and imprisoned. Later, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis offered Letho a deal: sow chaos in the North by assassinating key rulers, blaming the Lodge of Sorceresses for the chaos, in exchange for the restoration of the Viper School.
Killing kings.
King Esterad Thyssen of Kovir and Poviss was initially Letho's first target, but this changed when he encountered Síle de Tansarville, who contracted him to assassinate King Demavend III and helped organize the assassination. In 1271, Letho infiltrated Demavend's ship on the Pontar and used a Northern Wind-based capsule to freeze most of the ship, killing nearly everyone aboard except for a few protected by Abelard of Hagge's counterspell. Letho then slaughtered the remaining guards and decapitated the king, keeping the head as proof. Following Síle's suggestion, Letho sought out Iorveth, securing an alliance with the Scoia'tael to assist in assassinating other Northern kings.
Because the kingslayers' first attempt on King Foltest's life failed due to Geralt's presence, which resulted in the would-be assassin's death, Letho planned a second attempt on the Temerian monarch's life with Iorveth, while remaining out of Síle's or anyone else's reach. Aware of the imminent siege at La Valette Castle, Letho decided to disguise himself as a monk guarding the king's children—a ruse he maintained by framing himself as a tortured monk and then killing the monk that had treated him. After successfully taking over the castle, Foltest appeared with Geralt, who was now acting as his bodyguard. The king asked Geralt to give him and the children some space, and with his back turned, Geralt heard the attack too late as Letho revealed himself just after killing Foltest. Letho then fled out of a window, escaping with the help of the Scoia'tael, leaving Geralt wrongly accused of regicide. Shortly after this assassination, Letho attempted to betray Iorveth by turning one of his lieutenants against him. When the elf refused, Letho killed his entire unit to cover his tracks and left Ciaran to be captured by Flotsam's guards.
Geralt, now aware of Letho's betrayal, tried to expose him by leading Iorveth to the kingslayer. However, the Scoia'tael were attacked by the Blue Stripes, leading to a battle between Geralt and Letho. Letho prevailed but spared Geralt, revealing that Geralt had once saved his life, and they were now "even." Letho then kidnapped Triss Merigold and forced her to teleport them to Aedirn, killing Cedric in the process.
In Vergen, Letho abandoned Triss and regrouped with Serrit and Auckes. Knowing the Scoia'tael would soon learn of his betrayal, the trio massacred them, leaving only one survivor. Hearing about the upcoming summit at Loc Muinne, Letho headed there, entrusting Serrit and Auckes with assassinating King Henselt or to act as cover while he escaped when their hideout was discovered.
"If Geralt didn't save Triss:" Letho rescued her from the Nilfgaardians in Geralt's stead. While he was successful in rescuing the sorceress, he was ultimately captured and brought before the kings at the summit, where he revealed that he had killed Foltest and Demavend, and that he had cooperated with the Lodge to accomplish this. When the dragon Saesenthessis attacked, Letho managed to escape.
Knowing that Síle had become a liability, Letho sabotaged her megascope by replacing one of the crystals with a flawed one. Unless Geralt intervenes, Letho is successful, and Síle dies in the resulting explosion. Afterwards, the kingslayer waited in the center of the Temerian Quarter in Loc Muinne to speak with his former companion. Letho offered Geralt vodka, explained his deal with the emperor, the fate of Yennefer, and all that he knew about the Wild Hunt.
"If Geralt fights Letho:" the two engaged in a final battle, with Geralt ultimately defeating Letho and killing him.
"If Geralt lets Letho go:" the two parted ways, believing they'd never see each other again.
On the run.
"If Geralt let Letho live:"Having succeeded in tearing the North apart, Letho learned afterwards that it was all for naught, with Emperor Emhyr not only going back on his word to restore the School of the Viper but, as Letho was now a living witness to the emperor's plans, the witcher was a liability and assassins were sent after him. With a high price on his head and bounty hunters chasing him everywhere, Letho traveled around, not staying anywhere too long, before he dropped in at the abandoned Reardon Manor in Velen in 1272. Coincidentally, Geralt was in the area as well on unrelated business.
"If Geralt doesn't help him out:" the two parted ways, with Letho heading off to take care of his business by himself.
"If Geralt helps him out:" Letho and Geralt talked for a bit, with Letho explaining his "on the run" situation before a group of scouts arrived, no doubt sent to see if Letho was there. After the two witchers killed them off, Letho asked his former friend for help in dealing with the bounty hunters and the two set out together to track down Louis, an acquaintance of Letho's and the only one who knew where the witcher was hiding, having recommended the manor to Letho. It turned out that Louis sold him out and, not one to forgive such actions, Letho left him to die. He then had Geralt follow him to Lindenvale and told Geralt that whatever happened next, to not interfere, before throwing a bomb at a nearby barn, causing it to explode and several armed bounty hunters to run out of a nearby hut. After a short conversation between Letho and the group's leader, Arnout Vester, one of the bounty hunters shot a crossbow at the witcher and he attacked, killing off six of them before falling over, seeming dead. Letho woke up sometime later, with Geralt waiting nearby, having sensed on closer inspection that Letho had used a substance to only make it appear that he died.
"If Geralt kills the hunters:" However, as Geralt hadn't known about this beforehand, he'd killed off all the rest of the bounty hunters in retaliation and Letho told him off, stating his plan was to make it appear that he'd died so the bounty hunters would stop chasing him and spread the news of his "death" but now all the eyewitnesses were dead, ruining that plan.
"If Geralt doesn't interfere:" Having let the rest of the bounty hunters go, Letho was pleased to see that Geralt hadn't interfered with his ultimate plan: to make it look like he'd died so that the bounty hunters would stop chasing him and the witnesses would spread the news of his "death". However, he was thankful that Geralt had come along to help as his friend explained if he hadn't spoken up, the other bounty hunters would have cut off his head as proof; instead, they just took his medallion.
"If Geralt invites him to Kaer Morhen:" regardless of the outcome with the bounty hunters, having nowhere else to go, Geralt invited Letho to Kaer Morhen, a place where he could lay low for awhile. Taking the offer, Letho made his way there and later participated in The Battle of Kaer Morhen, fighting alongside Geralt and Lambert against the Wild Hunt's scouts initially before the group retreated into the keep's courtyard. After the battle, he then informed Geralt he planned to travel east, past the mountains.
"If Geralt doesn't invite him to Kaer Morhen:" After talking with Geralt about where he planned to go, Letho stated he wanted a change in scenery and thought maybe Zerrikania might be a nice place to visit.
"Disguised as a blind monk, the mysterious assassin took Geralt by surprise. Displaying immense self-control and lightning reflexes — not to mention a talent for acting — he murdered the king before the witcher's very eyes. He then leapt out the window of the solar before Geralt could grab him. Surviving the fall unharmed, the assassin fled with the aid of some Scoia'tael."
"The information in Vernon Roche's possession served to confirm what Geralt had witnessed. A man matching the kingslayer's description had been seen in the company of Scoia'tael near the trading post of Flotsam. Finding him seemed like the witcher's only chance."
"The mysterious individual now had a name. It appeared that this Letho, whoever he might be, was playing his own game — one in which the Scoia'tael had become an impediment. Yet his ultimate objective remained a mystery to Geralt."
"Letho had indeed been working with the Squirrels, doing their wet work for them. Geralt would soon learn the answers to many more questions."
"In the ruins of the elven bath, Geralt and the mysterious assassin stood eye to eye a second time. Geralt was surprised by what he learned. Letho of Gulet had been a witcher! What is more, there were other kingslayers, and they and Letho had worked together to assassinate the two dead northern monarchs. The witcher and the assassin were also no strangers — in fact, Geralt had once saved Letho's life. Their discussion ended abruptly as arrows whistled through the air and swords clashed. Letho demonstrated his strength and skills by beating Geralt black and blue. Before leaving, he announced that he was on his way to Aedirn."
"The kingslayer proved true to his word and kidnapped Triss, wounding Cedric mortally in the process. He forced the sorceress to aid him by teleporting them both to Aedirn."
"The magic sent Geralt a vision and gave us another bit of information. Letho had been in the area earlier and had ordered his accomplices to assassinate King Henselt. The kingslayers had been working with Síle de Tansarville, but, just as with Iorveth, their paths had diverged. Whatever finale would conclude this story, Letho claimed it would take place in Loc Muinne."
"I listened to the rest of the tale with bated breath. Led to the summit by Nilfgaardian envoys, Letho publicly accused the sorcerers of commissioning the assassinations of the northern monarchs."
"The kingslayer's intricate plan was revealed too late. Letho had been working for the Nilfgaardian Empire from the very beginning — his mission, to seed chaos before the Black Ones embarked upon a new war. Taking advantage of the ambitions of the Lodge of Sorceresses, its contacts and financial means — not to mention the support of the oblivious Scoia'tael partisans — Letho had eliminated two of the Nordlings' most important monarchs, plunging their realms into chaos."
"On top of that, he had thrown suspicion on the sorcerers, who were just regaining their standing. Thus was the force which had stopped Nilfgaard at Sodden dealt a truly shattering blow."
"Now Geralt had only to confront the kingslayer himself, so that the man could confirm or deny the witcher's suspicions. Only Letho knew the truth of the backroom intrigue which had left the north running with the blood of kings. Now I shall tell you about their final meeting, and its conclusion..."
"The Witcher Battle Arena".
Letho of Gulet was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins. He was a warrior class hero.
"Letho of Gulet - a witcher, a mighty warrior also known as The Kingslayer. Letho is a fantastic tank (i.e. a warrior whose main occupation is to keep enemies busy) and is very efficient against mages."
"He excels in one-on-one fights, in which, thanks to his QUEN sign, he can sustain a fair number of magical and physical damage. It's also worth mentioning that his shield, rather than just decreasing damage by a fixed amount, takes the full blow of a given enemy skill and allows Letho to remains unscathed as long as the spell is active. In practice, this means that each layer of QUEN (quantity depending on the ability level) will completely absorb both a mere hand-to-hand attack performed by a mage, as well as a powerful spell that would otherwise take half of Letho's HP."
"Letho's AARD sign is a "crowd control" ability. CC (short for Crowd Control) is usually used to stun, displace and slow down opponents, and it can play a pivotal role in a fight. If cast at the right time, the AARD Sign can put an enemy right in the middle of your group, allowing others to finish him or her off quickly. On the other hand, if used without thinking, it can facilitate an enemy's escape, or move them away from a friendly offensive spell's area of effect."
"Cleave, Letho's special skill, is a perfect finisher ability. You can use it to finish off fleeing and wounded enemies. Cleave makes Letho become invisible for a short period of time, and also gives him a huge speed boost. The witcher can then easily catch up with his enemy, and dispose of them with one powerful strike. Cleave, just like AARD, should be used with great consideration. It's an awesome finishing move, but it can also be used as an escape tool, which will save your skin on multiple occasions. There is one more aspect of Cleave you need to be aware of - when used, it silences the enemy making him or her unable to use abilities for a short time. Thanks to this, Letho can also take the role of an initiator - a fighter who spearheads the fight, taking the most dangerous enemy out of the equation first."
"Some friends you see after many years apart and you immediately develop a headache. Not out of antipathy, but as a somatic premonition of the hangover sure to follow your drunken reunion. Seeing others, however, gives you an itching pain in your back and a desire to reach for your blade."
"For Geralt, Letho of Gulet had a foot in both of these camps. This renegade witcher of the school of the Viper had the blood of at least two Nordling kings on his hands, the fruit of his cooperation with Nilfgaard's emperor, Emhyr var Emreis. Accused of these crimes, Geralt was forced to chase down Letho to clear his own name. Though both walked away from their final confrontation in the ruins of Loc Muinne alive and unharmed, Geralt did not think he would ever see Letho again."
"It thus came as quite a shock when he happened across Letho in a barn loft somewhere in the war-ravaged Temerian borderlands."
If Geralt decides not to follow Letho:
"It turned out Letho's former employer was less than satisfied with his performance and had set a variety of blood hounds on his trail. In these circumstances, the presence of another witcher to guard his back was more than welcome. Geralt, however, could not shake the bad taste left in his mouth by their prior interactions and went his own way, leaving Letho to clean up his own mess."
If Geralt decides to help Letho:
"It turned out Letho's former employer was less than satisfied with his performance and had set a variety of blood hounds on his trail. In these circumstances, the presence of another witcher to guard his back was more than welcome. Geralt remembered the care Letho had given Yennefer and, in a show of solidarity, decided to help his former companion deal with his pursuers."
If Geralt kills Letho's pursuers:
"In order to shake the hounds off his trail, Letho had decided on a risky maneuver — faking his own death. His plan would have worked perfectly, too, had Geralt's hero reflexes not been a tad overstrung, causing him to butcher any and all witnesses who might have spread the news."
If Geralt goes along with Letho's plan:
"In order to shake the hounds off his trail, Letho had decided on a risky maneuver — faking his own death. Although Geralt had no forewarning of this, he improvised with aplomb and sent Letho's pursuers off convinced they had rid the world of a kingslayer."
If Geralt asks him to go to Kaer Morhen:
"After that, there was nothing more for Letho to do but disappear. Geralt proposed he hide out at Kaer Morhen for a while, and after a bit of thought Letho agreed."
"Though some of Geralt's companions did not extend Letho a very warm welcome, the decision to invite him to Kaer Morhen proved wiser than Geralt could have known. During the battle against the Wild Hunt Letho proved his courage and valor while contributing to the victory over the Red Riders."
If Geralt doesn't ask him to go to Kaer Morhen:
"After that, there was nothing more for Letho to do but disappear. He and Geralt shared a brief farewell and then went their separate ways once more."

Woe to the Vanquished is a quest in "". Geralt witnesses conquering soldiers mistreating the inhabitants of the village within the walls of the La Valette Castle, and may decide to intervene.
Walkthrough.
After Geralt, Triss, Vernon Roche and King Foltest escaped from the dragon, Foltest asked the witcher to find another way to enter the castle temple. This mission entailed wandering in the village, where Temerian soldiers were mistreating the citizens.
This quest is in two parts. 1) begins by passing near a certain house, which triggers a cut-scene in which a woman bursts outside and is shot in the back by a soldier's crossbow bolt. 2) is confronting a commander who is about to set fire to a house in which several folk have been trapped.
Clearly, showing charity in both cases will yield more experience now and (optionally) more orens later.
Journal entry.
Prologue
 "An easy victory behind them, Foltest's soldiers grew cocky. They brazenly terrorized the town's inhabitants. Geralt watched their acts of cruelty with growing disgust."
 "When Geralt saw a soldier shoot a fleeing woman, it proved the last straw and the the witcher intervened. He had often taken the side of the oppressed, and this time was no different. Clearly, something very wrong was going on inside the house from which the woman had fled."
 "Inside, a group of Foltest's soldiers were threatening to kill some townsfolk unless they surrender their gold and valuables. The witcher managed to calm the hot-headed fighters, and it seems a massacre had been averted. Moments later Geralt learned that elsewhere soldiers were herding townsfolk into a single home. Genocide was in the air."
 "Eager for blood and booty, the soldiers intended to set fire to the house in which they had imprisoned the townsfolk. The subjects of the La Valettes were in mortal danger, and only the witcher could save them. Therefore, our hero approached the unit's commander and a sharp exchange ensued."
 If you don't save them
 "Since Foltest was hardly a patient man, Geralt had to focus on carrying out the king's orders. He had no time to intervene on behalf of the townsfolk and never learned their fate."
If you choose to save them
 "The negotiations grew so heated that the negotiators soon drew their swords. Geralt knew perfectly well that if he could defeat the Temerian commander in a duel, his men would stand down and refrain from killing the townsfolk."
 "And so it was. Seeing their commander yield to the witcher, the soldiers lost their zeal for tormenting civilians. They sauntered off like beaten dogs, and the townsfolk were saved."
 If you don't ask for reward in the end
 "The witcher then freed the civilians trapped inside the house and - the true hero that he was - refused to take any reward. It is through such deeds that Geralt inspired me to write up-lifting ballads."
Chapter I - If you saved them and didn't ask for a reward in the end
 If you accept their reward
 "When fate plays tricks on the witcher, these tricks are usually unpleasant. How surprised then was Geralt when a family of burghers saved from the soldiers at the La Valettes' castle found him in Flotsam? Geralt accepted their thanks and a pouch full of orens. That event reminded him that witchers defended people not only from monsters, but also from other people."
 If you don't accept their reward
 "When fate plays tricks on the witcher, these tricks are usually unpleasant. How surprised then was Geralt when a family of burghers saved from the soldiers at the La Valettes' castle found him in Flotsam? Geralt accepted their thanks, but did not accept their money. He always reminisced fondly about that event."

<doc id="12251" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12251" title="Trial by Fire">
Trial by Fire

Trial by Fire is a quest in "". It is the fourth piece of "back-story" which Geralt recalls while Roche interrogates him.
Walkthrough.
As King Foltest, Geralt, Triss, and Roche get nearer to La Valette Castle's temple, they are attacked by a dragon.
Run to the left or right, into the nearest wooden 'bridge tunnel'. As long as the roof is not destroyed, you are safe from the dragon's fire. While pushing forward, leave some space for your companions so that you don't block them from engaging the La Valette soldiers.
As you run to the front part of the wooden structure (towards the second), you may notice the dragon on your left, breathing fire onto the structure. Wait until the dragon takes a dive out of sight, then run across the gap to the second structure. This way the dragon won't come up in time to breath fire onto you.
Again, try to let your companions engage the enemies and sneak in a few hits of your own. The main thing is to sustain as little damage as possible while finishing off the enemies as quickly as possible.
Once the enemies are down (or the second structure has been compromised), run into the shelter of the walls. As long as you are underneath the walls, the dragon fire won't be able to touch you. Take care to let your companions pass first, lest you get sandwiched between your companions and enemy soldiers. Once the enemies are dealt with, a cut-scene will occur after which you will have to run across a burning bridge. If you don't run quick enough, the bridge will collapse and you will die.
 "Two startling events occurred during the siege of La Valette Castle: counter to prophecy, Goodguest the White killed his brother and not his father, while Count Palatine Rosencrantz stooped to catch his dropping pants and thus evaded an axe headed straight for his neck. Also, no one could have predicted that the Temerians would be attacked by a dragon. Not a forktail, as the scouts had reported, but a huge, angry, fire-breathing dragon. Surprised by the beast, Geralt stood no chance against it on the bridge. He ordered all to retreat to the town, and rushed in that direction himself. It was there, in the temple quarter, that Foltest's children were being held. The king's goal was at once the witcher's."
 "We should pay honor to the soldiers and knights of the La Valettes, who defended their lords to the bitter end. They did not retreat, even when the dragon belched forth its devastating fire. Seeking shelter from the heat beneath the hoarding, Geralt was forced to put them to the sword. Once the defenders were no more, Foltest and the others could pass through the gate."
 "The La Valette forces had been defeated, but the dragon remained a threat. It came at our heroes with all its might. Showing presence of mind and exceptional ability, Triss Merigold responded with magic. With her help Geralt, Foltest and Vernon Roche managed to reach the bridge leading to the town. There, Geralt did all he could to safely get his comrades to the other side."
 "Our heroes survived the ordeal through a bit of luck, but also by staying clearheaded. To this very day, Geralt remembers the events on the bridge as some of the most perilous in his career as a witcher."

By the King's Will is one of the first quests in "", triggered when Geralt tells Roche "The King summoned me."
Walkthrough.
Geralt and Triss are rudely interrupted by a soldier reporting that King Foltest has summoned the witcher. There is time to discuss a few matters (including a scout's incredible report of a dragon) with Triss as Geralt equips himself. Then be on the lookout for orens, crafting materials and herbs along the sides of the path on the way to the king. Geralt can also get a few extra orens from a recruit (standing alone by a tent) by reminding him that he owes for a cockatrice the witcher dealt with.
Close by in the exercise yard are training dummies to work on Geralt's targeting, swings or footwork, and an early chance to try out two of the minigames, arm wrestling and dice poker.
To the east, the king attends to his artillery. Today's ultimate goal is to secure his children, Anaïs and Boussy La Valette, who are being held in the solar of a temple within the fortress. Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, ambassador from the Nilfgaardian Empire, makes his first appearance, needling Foltest about questions of the royal succession.
Foltest describes the virtues and singular flaw of the ballista to Shilard, and on the way to inspect one of them, promotes a guard he recognizes to the rank of decurion. He then introduces one of his ballistae - actually the queen's: birthday 'presents' from a previous year. Shilard relents from his questioning and returns to camp, and Geralt may choose one of two ways to humor the king when he asks whether he was "patient and courteous", as Foltest says Triss advised.
With a spyglass he then recognizes Count Enzo Etcheverry atop the castle's walls and orders that the ballista prepare to fire. Tossing the spyglass to Geralt, Foltest tests our witcher's forward-observer talents: If the correct firing angle (1.5 degrees) is chosen, Geralt will face fewer enemies later on.
Eventually Geralt and the King enter a siege tower, climb to the top and prepare for battle. The back-story continues with At the Fore.
 "Ever since Geralt saved Foltest's life, the king had been fond of keeping his favorite witcher close by his side. Thus, when the monarch laid siege to the walled town and castle of the mutinous Baroness La Valette, Geralt found himself whiling the days away a few tents down from the king's own, in the company of Triss Merigold — a sorceress, the witcher's lover, and Foltest's royal advisor. These were pleasant moments, despite the mild restlessness that plagued our hero. Finally, on the day of the assault, he was summoned before His Royal Majesty. And that is how his troubles began."
 "At that time, King Foltest was playing host to Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, the Empire of Nilfgaard's senior emissary. The monarch and envoy were conferring when Geralt arrived as the hour of the assault drew near. The confident king and the witcher — making the best of a tense situation — moved to join the king's forces in the siege tower."
 "Propelled by the soldiers' mighty shoulders, the siege tower rolled towards victory. Green recruits shat themselves, veterans drank deeply from tightly clasped flasks, Foltest boasted and roused his troops, while Geralt struggled with a sense of foreboding."

To the Temple!

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
To the Temple is a quest in the Prologue of "".
Walkthrough.
The solution is found at a well in a small yard surrounded on three sides by commoners' houses. The most immediate access to this area becomes blocked by a wagon as Geralt approaches it, leaving only one way to the well, through several La Valette soldiers.
Once down the well, a path can be found to the castle sewers. Several drowners lurk in the water but should not be much trouble. There is also a Place of Power granting a Vitality bonus, tucked away in a disused cell.
Continuing through the only available unlocked doors, Geralt gets under the keep, finds a set of stairs, and encounters more La Valette soldiers on the way up. Upwards through another door is a cemetery, crowded with headstones and herbs; Geralt also spots Scoia'tael on the shores below, in a brief cut-scene.
Further on, Geralt finally enters the temple proper, encountering one heavily armed-and-armored guard and two with shields. The 'heavy' guard carries the key to the gatehouse, which gives access to a chest and allows Geralt to open the gate for Foltest, Roche and the rest.
 "An ancient temple stood within the walls of La Valette Castle, and the defenders had hidden Foltest's children there. As was the custom during attacks, the gate to the sanctuary was firmly shut. Battering it down would take the soldiers far too long to satisfy the irritable Foltest. The king ordered Geralt to find another way inside, so the witcher went to search for a back entrance."
 "As it turned out, some La Valette soldiers had barricaded themselves in a back alley. The witcher thought it strange that someone would defend a dead end, and concluded that the alley could conceal a secret passage to the temple grounds."
 "Geralt's hunch proved correct. The alley led to a small square, where there was a well through which La Valette soldiers were passing between the temple grounds and the town. The witcher dropped down into the well and entered a secret passage."
 "Lo and behold, the secret tunnel accessed through the old well proved an alternate route to the sanctuary. Accustomed to navigating tight corridors and caves, the witcher reached the exit in no time. Now he had to open the gate from the inside and let the restless king and his troops in. But the gate was defended by La Valette soldiers. Geralt found himself searching the yard for the gate mechanism while fending off attacking foes."
 "Having overcome the defenders and opened the temple gate, Geralt went out through it to show Foltest in. He had accomplished this mission, yet more danger awaited on the path leading to the king's bastard children."

 "When Geralt thwarted the plans of the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, it seemed the situation in Vizima would return to normal sooner or later. A blow came from an unexpected quarter. As the witcher was collecting his reward from King Foltest, an assassin sneaked into the throne room of the Royal Palace. Foltest would have perished if not for the witcher's presence of mind. Geralt defeated the would-be kingslayer and thus saved the monarch's life, but the witcher was left wondering who had sent the killer and why. Intriguingly, the assassin seemed very similar to a witcher, so much so that he might even have been one."
 "Foltest was not so lucky the second time. Having dropped his guard, the witcher was caught by surprise and the king died at the hands of an assassin. The murderer was also a mutant — similar in garb and behavior to the previous assassin. Furthermore, he seemed to recognize Geralt. Sadly, the kingslayer escaped, and our hero was blamed for the monarch's death."
 "First imprisoned and now pursued for a crime he did not commit, the witcher was sailing up the Pontar River toward the town of Flotsam. Geralt wanted to clear his name and was intrigued by the witcher-like assassins. Our hero needed to solve the mystery of the kingslayers. And a certain informant of the Temerian intelligence service was to help him in that."
 "Just outside Flotsam, Geralt saw Foltest's murderer once more. The assassin was in the company of Iorveth, the commander of a Scoia'tael unit. This was surely no coincidence, and, as it would turn out later, the encounter was deliberately staged indeed. From that moment on, the witcher began to wonder if he could use the elven leader to get to the assassin."
 "From the very beginning the prison ship moored at the wharf attracted Geralt's attention. Non-humans — actual or alleged Scoia'tael and their collaborators — were imprisoned below decks. When Triss told the witcher that an adjutant of Iorveth by the name of Ciaran was among the prisoners, our hero decided to speak with him personally. He and the sorceress proceeded to the wharf, hoping to reach the unit's leader, and by extension Letho, through Ciaran."
 "The intelligence proved true, however Geralt was unable to speak with Ciaran for the elf was writhing in agony, dying. Before Triss could start healing, Geralt had to use the Axii Sign to calm him."
 "Following the conversation with Iorveth's adjutant, the search for the kingslayers gathered momentum. However, other matters, of greater importance to Geralt, could not wait. The Witcher had a very serious conversation with Triss Merigold, the results of which are detailed in another thread, and only after he finished what he was asked, did he continue the investigation."
 "Geralt wanted to see that matter of the kingslayers through to its end, a fact that Triss didn't like because she wanted to leave everything behind and go far, far away with her beloved. Despite that, the sorceress decided to aid our hero in all his designs. She started preparing an infusion from the rose of remembrance and sent the witcher to Zoltan. You may recall that the dwarf was in contact with the Scoia'tael and could bring Geralt to Iorveth."
 "Zoltan was a very helpful dwarf, a fact to which anyone he has helped to empty a cask of beer can attest. Geralt didn't have to repeat himself, and before you could say "Searching for Squirrels in a forest smells of suicide," Zoltan and the witcher marched to the Scoia'tael meeting place."
 "Geralt indeed found Scoia'tael in the place indicated by Zoltan. He learned where to find Iorveth and was warned about a beast prowling the area. Of the two evils, Zoltan preferred to face the monster. He was certain the Squirrels were preparing an ambush."
 "The forest monster was an arachas, a creature so vile and dangerous that its description could cause ladies and the more sensitive young men to faint. Well, to a witcher no creature is vile — it is either easy to kill or hard to kill. Unfortunately the arachas was one of the latter, a fact the witcher learned the hard way."
 "The arachas was slain, but a more dangerous for emerged from the forest. It turned out that Iorveth had been watching as the witcher battled the beast. Intrigued by our hero's bravado, he even deigned not the have the intruders shot, as was his custom. This way Geralt had a chance to discuss Letho's betrayal with the elf and was every bit as diplomatic as the situation allowed. And know that the situation did not allow for much leeway, for the lives of Zoltan and Geralt hung by a thread throughout. Fortunately, the witchers information proved compelling enough that Iorveth not only heard them out, but also agreed to work with them."
 "Zoltan returned to Flotsam, and Geralt struck a deal with Iorveth. They decided to set a trap. The witcher bound the Scoia'tael leader and led him straight to Letho. He hoped that the gift would earn the hulk's trust, and that he would divulge information about his employers."
 "Finally the witcher's desire was fulfilled. Geralt and the kingslayer stood face to face and their swords clashed. Our hero had hoped to punish Foltest's killer, but he met his match."
 If Geralt sides with Iorveth:
 "Geralt has always been the master of his own fate, and should you be amazed that he decided to betray Vernon Roche and surrender to Iorveth, you don't know the witcher well. As he thought getting the kingslayer and avenging Foltest was the most important thing, he went straight for it. Only his friends know how naive his idealism can be. The kingslayer defeated and humiliated Geralt, and when he was done he left for town. Yet the witcher would not give up so easily. He knew Letho wanted to get Triss, so he ran to save the imperiled sorceress."
 If Geralt sides with Vernon:
 "Geralt wanted to get the kingslayer at all costs, so he chose to betray Iorveth, handing him over to Roche. And so he was able to face Foltest's killer, but the encounter ended badly. He was defeated and humiliated, but his resolve remained intact. The kingslayer headed for town to capture Triss, but Geralt was hot on his trail, determined to save the sorceress."
 "Though Demavend was already dead, Letho still had business in Aedirn. He had to get there fast, so he kidnapped Triss Merigold and forced her to open a magical portal to the town of Vergen on the Aedirnian border. Geralt was too late and could not prevent the sorceress' abduction, but he began pursuit as he was done with Flotsam."
 "Geralt knew that Letho had teleported somewhere into the area of Vergen, and Triss Merigold arrived in the town's vicinity along with him. The witcher began looking for the kingslayers trails."
 Iorveth's path:
 "Geralt learned first-hand that the soldier of fortune Adam Pangratt was tasked with killing Letho."
 "A murderer's dream was another trail in Geralt's search. He found it in the harpies' nest and, witnessing the discussion between Auckes and Letho, he learned the name of their employer. Demavend's death was ordered by the sorceress Síle de Tansarville."
 "Geralt was still trying to find the kingslayers, but two of them were already dead. Only Letho, the craftiest and most dangerous of the three, remained alive. And it was him that Geralt wanted to find most of all."
 "How surprised Geralt was when he heard the terms of Henselt's capitulation. The defeated king of Kaedwen was to accept Síle de Tansarville, the woman standing behind the assassinations of the northern monarchs, as his advisor. Henselt had no choice and Geralt could only stand by, powerless and angry, watching the intrigue bear fruit. By all appearances, Saskia's victory was in truth a victory for Philippa and Síle, and both sorceresses must have had plans reaching far further than the Pontar Valley."
 "Yet Síle de Tansarville did not command the kingslayers by herself. She cooperated with Philippa Eilhart, another mistress of magic."
 Roche's path:
 "Looking for the murderer, the witcher learned that there was a captured Scoia'tael in Henselt's camp. The connection between Letho and Iorveth in mind, Geralt decided to talk to the captive and ask him about the kingslayer. He hoped the prisoner would direct him to a fresh trail."
 "And he hit the jackpot. The captured elf confessed that Letho and his two companions were indeed in the area. They had betrayed the Scoia'tael and murdered members of the unit. Furthermore, Geralt learned that the assassins were plotting something regarding the arrival of the Redanian delegation."
 "Surely the reader must have noticed that no kingslayer had harassed Henselt yet. The more suspicious among you might even read into that. Well, push finally came to shove and the king was attacked. The witcher, once again, was nearby when the assassin struck. With Foltest's death fresh in his memory, Geralt stood between the assassin and his would-be victim."
 "Geralt defended Henselt and slew the assassin. The king was both terrified and furious. He wanted to know who was behind the killing and what the assassin's motives were. Any means of revealing the truth was justified in his eyes. Dethmold was ordered to question the assassin's corpse using the forbidden art of necromancy. However, the sorcerer needed the witcher's help."
 "Dethmold performed a magic ritual, and the witcher saw the recent past through the dead kingslayer's eyes. He saw Letho speak of working with Síle de Tansarville, which clearly implicated the sorceress in the murders! Yet by the time Geralt awoke and identified the sorceress as guilty, she was gone. She had managed to slip away, and the witcher could do nothing but follow her to the assassins' hideout he had seen in his vision."
 "However the witcher was too late. Síle had reached the place first and killed the hiding assassin, leaving Letho the sole remaining assassin of kings. Or so she thought. The sorceress had acted in haste and done a sloppy job. The kingslayer was fatally wounded but, with his last breath, told Geralt that Síle de Tansarville had fled for Vergen."
 "Geralt reported back to Dethmold, who was not surprised, for he had never trusted Síle and held an old grudge against her. For now, the sorceress was safely beyond Vergen's walls, further protected from pursuit by the ghastly mist on the battlefield. Yet the mist would soon be dispersed by the witcher, who had found a way to life the curse."
 "Geralt knew that he will find both Síle and Letho — the two behind the monarchs' assassinations — in Loc Muinne. So he journeyed to the ruined city, to bring about the last chapter of the story of the assassins of kings."
 "The story of the assassins of Kings ended in Loc Muinne. But before the conclusion arrived, a series of unexpected events took place. If you wish to know more about Letho, the power that stood behind him and the motives which had spurred his nefarious deeds, be patient and listen."
Iorveth's path:
 "Geralt had acquired another piece of the puzzle. In talking to the imprisoned Philippa, he learned that Síle de Tansarville had hired the assassins of kings on behalf of a secret organization known as the Lodge of Sorceresses. The magicians, however, had underestimated Letho's treacherous nature and lost control over him. Interestingly, Triss Merigold had also been a member of the Lodge — at least until the other sorceresses had stopped trusting her. Other revelations were not long in coming."
 If Geralt does not remove the flawed diamond from Síle's megascope during the quest "Enter the Dragon":
 "After fighting the magically controlled dragon in Loc Muinne, Geralt finally got Síle de Tansarville. The sorceress tried to flee once more, but this time she was stopped. The woman who had Demavend assassinated died murdered by the kingslayer."
 If Geralt removes the flawed diamond from Síle's megascope during the quest "Enter the Dragon":
 "After fighting the magically controlled dragon in Loc Muinne, Geralt finally got Síle de Tansarville. This time Geralt allowed her to flee, knowing that her deeds would soon be widely known and that the sorceress was done for."
 If Geralt chooses to rescue Triss:
 "After the fight, Geralt returned to the city to find Letho. As he climbed the wall, Triss Merigold offered him a helping hand. The witcher and the sorceress headed to meet Letho."
 "The witcher finally found the kingslayer. At that moment his desire to confront the kingslayer eclipsed all others. The witcher told Triss that he had private business to attend to, forbade interference and went to see Letho."
 If Geralt chooses to rescue Anais La Valette during the quest "For Temeria!":
 "After the fight, Geralt returned to the city to find Letho. As he climbed the wall, Vernon Roche offered him a helping hand. The two headed to meet Letho."
 "The city was in chaos. Sorcerers were pursued and murdered, factions clashed. All vestiges of civility had been abandoned and there was no way peace talks or parley would resume. Even Geralt – or perhaps especially he – had to defend himself from attackers. However, nothing could stop the witcher from reaching the kingslayer."
 "The witcher finally found the kingslayer. Triss Merigold ran to Geralt, having been freed from the Nilfgaardians' hands by Letho. Geralt was happy, don't get me wrong, but at that moment his desire to confront the kingslayer eclipsed all others. The witcher told his companions that he had private business to attend to, forbade interference and went to see Letho."
 If Geralt chooses to fight Letho:
 "Witchers are relics of a bygone era. The very thought that only a few of them remain brings sorrow to my heart, for as this caste of itinerant monster slayers passes into oblivion, so does the old world, which might not have been better, but was certainly simpler... Ask, however, if I pitied Geralt and Letho when their blades clashed, I will answer without a moment's hesitation — I did not. The tale of the kingslayers had to conclude with a duel to the death between the two finest swordsmen alive at that time. And only one of them could survive."
 If Geralt chooses to spare Letho:
 "Geralt and Letho had a long talk, one worth more than all the other discussions he had had recently put together. Believe it or not, but in the end the two witchers went their separate ways. Thus ended the story of the assassins of kings. What of Letho? What fate awaited Geralt? Those are stories for another time."
 or
 "Even the longest discussion must have an end. Geralt finished speaking with Letho and they parted, each on his own way, thus ending the story of the assassins of kings."

 "My story begins after the fateful events in which the witcher Geralt of Rivia, known also as the White Wolf, saved Foltest, Lord of Temeria, from an assassin. From that moment on, the monarch would not quit the witcher's company, turning him from an itinerant monster slayer into a royal bodyguard and thus causing him to suffer increasingly. However, since it is unwise to deny a king, Geralt now found himself in the lands of the La Valettes, where Foltest had taken personal command of the siege of the rebel family's walled town and castle. Witchers know well how fickle fortune can be, and accordingly luck had abandoned our hero within the castle walls. Due to a tragic mistake, Geralt was imprisoned in the castle's dungeon, where he had to patiently recount recent events to Vernon Roche, Foltest's right hand man. If you wish to know just how the witcher plunged from the pinnacle of success to the depths of misfortune, listen to my tale."
 "Geralt had been in trouble many times and in the slammer at least three - including once in my esteemed company. He had always been able to get out, either with the help of friends or by turns of good fortune. This time, however, things looked bleak. Almost everyone thought the witcher had murdered the king. Luckily, Vernon Roche had his doubts. Roche completed his grueling interrogation of Geralt and left the witcher to the guards, but not before leaving our hero the key to his manacles and adding that he would await aboard his ship. All Geralt had to do was to escape from the dungeon on his own. A trifle."
 "Prison guards are the same the world over: dumb and short-tempered. Geralt succeeded in provoking his "caretakers" as easily as a cook fries an omelet."
 If Geralt spared Aryan La Valette:
 "Life can be surprising, especially when you're trying to evade death. Sneaking through the dungeon, Geralt chanced upon Aryan La Valette. The erstwhile foes, brought together once more by fate, became allies. Aryan knew the castle like the back of his hand, but the witcher had a sword. So he went forth to clear the way."
 "Before anyone could say, "We've two vacant cells and several openings for new jailors, "Geralt dealt with the guards and turned back to find Aryan La Valette."
 "The young baron knew of a secret passage, so the fugitives headed off in its direction."
 "The witcher escaped from the fortress, but Aryan chose to remain behind. Pride would not allow him to leave his family seat in enemy hands. The ensuing fire was the talk of the surrounding villages for years, and to this day the phrase "bright as the night the castle burned down" remains in the local vernacular."
 "Geralt was free. He rushed towards the riverboat of the special forces, his head a jumble of questions. Triss Merigold and Vernon Roche awaited him on board the vessel, but alas, they had no answers. Future event would shed light on the mystery, but let's not get ahead of ourselves."
 If Geralt kills Aryan La Valette:
 "Scurrying through the corridors, Geralt encountered Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen leading the Baroness La Valette out of her cell. The Nilfgaardian emissary proved an ally of sorts, as he did not alert the guards. Fitz-Oesterlen left to pursue his business with the baroness, and Geralt crept on behind them."
 "When friends become foes, one must forge alliances with former enemies. Fitz-Oesterlen drew the guards away, thus helping the witcher escape. Yet nothing comes free in diplomacy, as subsequent events would show."
 "Geralt was free. He rushed towards the riverboat of the special forces, his head a jumble of questions. Triss Merigold and Vernon Roche awaited him on board the vessel, but alas, they had no answers. Future events would shed light on the mystery, but let's not get ahead of ourselves."

Ves was a member of the elite Blue Stripes special forces group. She was the only woman in the unit under Vernon Roche's command.
Biography.
Early life.
At 16 years of age, Ves was a beautiful young girl. Therefore, during the annihilation of her village by the Scoia'tael, she was spared and abducted by the commando's leader, as he had taken a shine to her. For several years, she was held prisoner by the commando. Eventually, Ves was freed by Vernon Roche and the Blue Stripes soldiers. After noticing her potential, Roche convinced her to enlist with the Blue Stripes unit.
"The fair-haired Ves stood apart from the rest of Vernon Roche's unit, and not only in that she was the only woman in an elite formation of hardened cutthroats and swashbucklers. Her girlish face and shapely body would stand out even if a uniform did emphasize them. For there is something in soldier women that attract a man's gaze, and Ves was no exception. The reader should not, however, be mislead by this description - one does not earn a Blue Stripes membership with good looks, but with skill, determination and, at times, ruthlessness. Anyone disregarding Ves would pay dearly for misjudging this young woman.""
"Because of her gender, Ves would sometimes receive assignments where her beauty was more important than her combat abilities and efficiency. Roche had used Ves as his trump card more than once."
"Ves had a steady hand and sure eye, making her the best sharpshooter in the unit. Not many could match her at throwing knives either."
Journal entry.
Ves returns in "The Witcher 3", aiding Roche in his guerrilla campaign against Nilfgaard although she is more radical, going as far as disobeying Roche's orders to protect those who helped them.
 "Ves was a veteran officer of the Blue Stripes and the only solider from Roche's former unit to have survived the war. After the Blue Stripes were decimated and officially disbanded, Ves remained at her commander's side to continue with him the seemingly hopeless struggle for Temerian freedom."
 "Energetic and tough, Ves had always impressed with her skill with crossbow and sword alike, outshooting and outshining all the men in her unit to a laughable degree."
 "Though usually well-disciplined, Ves refused to heed Vernon's command and set off alone to face enemy forces."
 "Ves' rash move landed her in a horrible pot of trouble that only Geralt's sword could dish her out of."
If Geralt asks Roche for help at Kaer Morhen:
 "Even had Ves not owed Geralt her life, she would have come to the defense of Kaer Morhen all the same, for she would follow Vernon Roche into the very bowels of the abyss."
If Geralt did not intervene in Reason of State:
"Ves had been a soldier all her life, a fact which made her unfortunate death during a political intrigue even bitterer. At least one part of her death matched her life: she fell at her commander's side."

La Valette Castle is the main keep of the House of La Valette. It's a walled town that boasts the greatest fortifications in Temeria, and perhaps in all the Northern Kingdoms in "". The citadel is located near the strategically important White Bridge, which connects the banks of the Pontar.
"During my travels I visited the dynastic abode of the La Valette family several times. Anyone who considers Vizima an impressive city is unlikely to have seen the ancestral citadel of the La Valettes. The immensity of the fortress is simply breathtaking, to the extent that calling it a mere castle is either a gross inaccuracy or a jest. Expanded over generations, the walled town boasts the greatest fortifications in Temeria, and perhaps in all the Northern Kingdoms. The citadel is located near the strategically important White Bridge, which connects the banks of the Pontar. It commands the entire area, including nearby trade routes and the crossing. No wonder then that the rebellion of the La Valettes disturbed Foltest's sleep."

Flotsam forests

Flotsam forests are woodlands surrounding Lobinden and Flotsam at a point where borders of Redania, Temeria, Aedirn, and Kaedwen are meeting. Location appears during Chapter I in "".
"The wilderness surrounding Flotsam was a thick impassable wood where inexperienced travellers could easily lose their way and fall victim to wild beasts or, even more probably, elven arrows. A rarely used, thickly overgrown route led to Aedirn, but, given the forest's dangers, most travelers preferred to journey by river."

Dungeons of La Valette Castle

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
Dungeons of La Valette Castle are located underground in the keep. They consist of a vast network of tunnels, infested with rats, droppings and human remains of those people who have lost their lives here. The tunnels branch out on two levels. In addition to cells, there is also a lower torture chamber and an interrogation room.
Other than regular criminals and thieves, political dissidents are captured and detained here. Recently, after the attack by King Foltest's army, the castle passed into the hands of Temerians, who imprisoned the rebels of the La Valettes and their allies. Among these are the Baroness Mary Louisa and her son Aryan.
Geralt of Rivia has also been held and handcuffed in one cell of the dungeons. At the beginning of "", the reason for his captivity is unknown until Vernon Roche enters the cell to question him.
 "During one of my visits to the La Valette family's vast abode, when I had the pleasure of meeting the old baron's niece - a charming creature but sixteen springs old - my host, clearly proud of his lands and holdings, offered to show me around the keep's expansive and varied cellars. While he entertained me with conversation and anecdotes on various subjects, including the unique system of penalties designed for seducers of the underaged, I got a thorough tour of the dungeon beneath La Valette Castle. The guards were exceptionally polite and seemed to have an unerring sense of direction within the labyrinthine network of vestibules, cells and winding corridors. I imagined that without their help it would be easy to lose one's way there, wandering around for hours, unable to find an exit. I would not envy any soul imprisoned there."

Archpriest

The high priest/high priestess or archpriest/archpriestess is a distinguished rank in the loose ladder of Nordling priesthood, under a hierarch.
These men and women oversee large, ancient temples devoted to one of the major deities of the pantheon. Whether they slowly push their racial prejudice as "blessed counsels" to monarchs or run noted schools and greenhouses, hardly anyone can ignore their impact on the daily life of the Northern Kingdoms including Skellige.
In Nilfgaard.
In the Nilfgaardian Empire, the High Priest is the highest religious rank belonging to the head of the state cult of the Great Sun. At least since Emreis family is on the throne, the high priesthood is a hereditary rank of emperors, who are also one of two principal objects of worship after the Sun itself.

Blood of His Blood is a quest in the Prologue of "".
Walkthrough.
After Trial by Fire, Geralt, Roche and Foltest finally reach La Valette Castle's temple. Within are numerous common folk seeking refuge and praying at the central altar, as well as several priests and a disgraced nobleman. Foltest reprimands the latter, Arthur Tailles, a count he had condemned who was then "pardoned" and protected by Baroness Mary Louisa. Geralt questions the Archpriest for the location of the two children; he is given no choice but to use the Axii sign, to which Tailles strenuously objects. (Whether or not Axii actually succeeds, the Archpriest tells the truth: the children are in the solar, in the next tower along the castle wall.) The witcher then does have a choice - a simple one, whether to punch Tailles in the gut or to simply tell him to shut up. Then Foltest and Roche wait for Geralt to proceed with them toward the solar.
As soon as they begin the crossing, the dragon returns! Roche is separated from the other two in the chaos, and another round of dragon-dodging begins! This time, the dragon crawls along the top of the wall as Geralt attempts to drag Foltest to safety.
The best that can be done is to constantly move "down"; any variation results in the dragon's sweeping claw connecting and Geralt and Foltest each being either crushed or knocked to his death. One brief variation in this pattern (which occurs automatically, as long as movement away from the dragon has been constant) is when the dragon breathes fire and the men duck away from the area of effect. From there it is not much farther to crawl ...
Once they enter the solar, a gate falls shut and the dragon gives up again. Foltest waits for Geralt to accompany him upstairs, and once that happens, all that's left is a fateful cut-scene.
 "Priests can be very touchy about intruders defiling their temples, a fact to which desecrators of the Lionhead Spider's sanctuaries can attest. Luckily, this time Geralt had a less macabre cult to deal with, and the high priest turned out to be sensitive to changes in the political climate. After a few words, the witcher and the monarch were on their way to the solar, where they hoped to find the children."
 "However, before our heroes could reach the king's progeny, the dragon swooped down on them once more. The beast attacked with fury and fought relentlessly. Had Geralt been, say, a potter, only charred corpses and possibly some earthenware shards would have remained. But the dragon was up against a witcher, and after a fierce battle it was forced to turn tail. Geralt led Foltest to the solar, to Boussy and Anaïs."
 "The king found his children, the blood of his blood, only to die at the hands of an assassin disguised as a monk. On a temple floor with his throat slit open — so died Foltest, son of Medell, King of Temeria, Prince of Sodden, Sovereign of Pontar and Mahakam, and Senior Protector of Brugge and Ellander. Geralt failed to stop the murderer, and when soldiers burst into the room, they immediately and mistakenly identified him as the kingslayer. They piled upon the witcher, knocking him down and knocking him out."

Barricade (quest)

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Barricade is a quest in the prologue of "". The quest is part of At the Fore quest and starts when Foltest orders Geralt to prepare the ballista in the courtyard under the castle walls.
Walkthrough.
Geralt and Foltest's army approach La Valette Castle walls by the siege tower. A group of defenders block the way. After the crew has been eliminated, the king orders Geralt to activate a ballista in the courtyard of the castle and break down the first gate.
Geralt must use a wooden scaffolding to reach the courtyard below. As he arrives, three soldiers attack him. The fight is not that hard, but take care not to be surrounded. There are more soldiers on the stairs to the right of the scaffolding. Kill them. When the area is safe, you can use it as a shelter to recover Geralt's vitality and vigor before the next fight.
On the left of the wooden scaffolding, there is the ballista protected by more soldiers. Two of them are well armored knights, so this fight is more difficult than the previous one. Once again, be careful to not let them surround Geralt. You can use the safe area to recover, since they will not pursue Geralt that far. They always stay around the ballista. Use Quen to protect Geralt, and Axii to charm one of the opponents into attacking the others. Or you can use some bombs, like Samum, to stun them and divide the group.
When the group has been eliminated, you can prepare the ballista using . Keep rapidly clicking the mouse button until the bar to the right is fully charged (this takes a bit of dedication). The yellow bar must be filled quickly enough or else more soldiers arrive and Geralt must kill them and then attempt to cock the ballista all over again. Then repeat the operation to aim the ballista in the right direction. Another group of enemies attacks Geralt. After all attackers are defeated and each preparation is complete, Geralt fires the ballista and the blow destroys the gate.
Geralt cannot climb back up the same scaffolding used to enter the area; use the stairs on the south wall then climb a different scaffolding and join the king in the newly-taken tower to continue At the Fore.
 "Foltest's assault lost momentum at one of the castle towers. The army that had raged like a hurricane until now suddenly stopped at the barricade the defenders had erected at the tower's entrance. There was no way to approach it, as La Valette arrows rained down from above like snowflakes at Yuletide. Luckily, in a nearby square stood a ballista that the defenders had failed to position on the walls. Geralt spotted the war machine and decided to use it to destroy the barricade. First, however, he had to overcome the soldiers guarding it."
 "Seeing what was about to happen, La Valette soldiers converged on the ballista to stop the witcher. Our hero would need to repel them, and only then could he aim the machine at the barricade blocking access to the tower."
 "In a desperate bid to stop the witcher, another wave of La Valette soldiers swarmed upon him. Our hero was forced to step away from the ballista once again to defend himself. He could launch the bolt only after dealing with the attackers."
 "In the end, Geralt manned the ballista with the skill of a consummate artilleryman. Hit by the heavy bolt from the machine, the makeshift barricade shattered into bits, and Foltest's troops resumed their assault on the tower. The witcher followed them to rejoin Foltest on the walls."
 "With Geralt back at his side, Foltest continued the assault on La Vallette Castle."

At the Fore is a primary quest from Prologue in "". It begins when Geralt is being interrogated by Vernon Roche in the Dungeons of La Valette Castle and is recounting all the prior events during the siege of La Valette Castle.
Choose the option "The assault" during the dialog with Roche to begin the quest.
Walkthrough.
Foltest and Geralt approaching the fortress walls in a siege tower. The door opens, and the king's company proceeds to scour La Valette's soldiers from the battlements. Protect and follow the king. This battle is not particularly hard, since Geralt is helped by Temerian soldiers. Both Aard and Quen can be useful. Enemies close to the edge of the ramparts are easily dispatched by Aard when it throws them off the walls.
When the first battle finishes, Foltest assigns two of his commanders to specific tasks, then asks Geralt for a suggestion to help penetrate a well-defended tower. Geralt spots a ballista in the courtyard still guarded by La Valette soldiers, and begins Barricade.
After accomplishing that task, Geralt returns to the king. They enter the next tower, where Count Etcheverry (if he survived the previous scene) and his men block the way. Since there are more skilled armored knights among them, Yrden, Axii, and Quen are particularly helpful here. When all the enemies have been defeated, king Foltest continues onward until he reaches a barricade at the base of a tower. The king's men are again blocked by crossbowmen atop another, higher tower, where the rebels' commander Aryan La Valette waits. Foltest asks him to surrender but the young baron has no intention of so doing. So the king orders Geralt to either end Aryan, or convince him to surrender.
Geralt approaches the tower, mowing down more of La Valette's men. Then he reaches the top to confront Aryan. (If you decide to fight him, it is advisable for Geralt to meditate before climbing the last step, to take some potions in preparation.)
The witcher and Aryan confront each other. Note that the choices made during this conversation will influence the course of The Dungeons of the La Valettes quest, as well as which attribute Geralt may obtain later on.
Geralt chooses to fight Aryan and his men:
This battle can be quite hard, so it is advisable to be prepared. There are archers on the edge. You need to kill them at first, protecting you with Quen. Try to dodge Aryan's knights blows. The best tactic is to take them next to the wall and cast Aard to throw them from it. You can also dispatch them using Yrden. When you have eliminated the most of Aryan's men, focus on their leader. When Aryan dies, the rest of his army will surrender at once.
 Geralt convinces Aryan to a regular duel, without his men:
Fighting Aryan alone is not too difficult. Just dodge or block his blows. Then use the Signs: Aard can help to lower his guard, Yrden will completely eliminate it for a short while, Quen to deflect his blows. When Aryan is killed, his men surrender at once.
 Geralt convinces him to surrender:
No battle is needed if you succeed in persuading Aryan. The young baron and his troop will drop their weapons and surrender.
The next episode of the back-story Geralt reveals to Roche is To the Temple!
 "The siege tower reached the walls and spewed forth its load of Temerian soldiers and knights. The battle was joined. Foltest fought in the vanguard. The witcher fought by his side, protecting the king. Led by these two, the soldiers moved towards the nearest tower, securing the walls one section at a time."
 "This was, as has been said, the family seat of the La Valettes, one of the most eminent houses in all Temeria. Brave soldiers loyal to Baroness Mary Louisa and her son Aryan defended it. The finest swordsman among them was the fair Sir Etcheverry, who stepped into Foltest's path atop the wall. This was a mistake, as it was the witcher who took up the knight's gauntlet."
 "The loyalist army pushed the enemy back, with Foltest at its head and Geralt but a step behind him."
 "The assault lost its momentum at the foot of a tower held by Aryan La Valette and a troop of skilled archers. Foltest was prepared to take heavy losses, but Geralt could not agree to more bloodshed without good cause. In addition to a strong arm, the witcher also possesses a lithe tongue, a fact to which many a sorceress can attest. He stealthily made his way to the top of the tower to parley with the proud, young baron."
 If Geralt persuades Aryan to give himself up:
 "Geralt explained the situation to Aryan in simple, soldierly words. The baron belonged to a rare breed — he was proud and rash, but no fool. La Valette chose to spare the soldiers who had stood so loyally by his side and surrendered the fortress. Not everyone followed that order, but Foltest's victory was nonetheless assured."
 If Geralt is forced to kill Aryan:
 "The rules of chivalry allow leaders to decide the outcome of a battle through a duel and thus spare their soldiers. Aryan was a man of honor and wanted to save the men who had stood so loyally at his side. He decided to cross swords with the witcher one on one."
 "La Valette was known as a consummate swordsman, but Geralt was no weakling, either. It was a fierce fight that ended with the young nobleman's death. His men honored the duel's result and surrendered the fortress. Foltest's victory was assured."

By the Gods - Stringing Up Sods is a quest from Chapter 1 in "".
Walkthrough.
Upon arriving in Flotsam, Geralt and his party are directed to the town square as an execution is taking place. ("Directed" is no understatement: all gates out of Flotsam are blocked until after the execution.) When the group reaches the square, they see none other than Dandelion and Zoltan Chivay on the scaffold along with two elves. The witcher must then find a way to stop his friends from being executed.
If Geralt is beaten by the guard or takes too long to finish him, the executioner will proceed with his orders.
As Loredo completes his performance and departs, inviting the witcher to a more private discussion later on, this quest proceeds to the next phase and Indecent Proposal begins.
Entering the inn, Geralt finds Dandelion, Roche, and Zoltan gathered at a table. Triss roams the ground floor; her two new topics of conversation are unrelated to the quest. She joins the others at the table as soon as the witcher opens conversation with them. Geralt can catch up with Dandelion and Zoltan's exploits (the former has become an informant for Roche, and the latter was nearly married), ask a pointed question or two, and attempt to satisfy their curiosity about the dragon at La Valette Castle; then he defers to Triss, who catches them up on Temerian politics (ask about a "resolution" to gain a journal entry on John Natalis). Geralt then recounts the story of the assassination - and then a disturbance draws the party outside to the docks. As the scene shifts, this quest ends, granting 300 xp: however, any potential talent spending must wait until one additional cut-scene and a couple of dialogues as The Kayran begins.
 "Cultural events are rare in the province. Thus it is unsurprising that when a rarity like the hanging of collaborators takes place, the whole town turns out. And when in Nilfgaard, do as the Nilfgaardians do. Geralt and company proceeded without hesitation to the scaffold square to partake in the local entertainment."
 "And at this point I enter the scene. I, Dandelion the unequalled, as described by some ladies: poet, lover, secret agent, friend and confidant to Geralt of Rivia. And at that moment a legal corpse with a noose around my neck. On the scaffold I was flanked by the dwarf Zoltan, also a friend of the witcher, and elves whom I never met before. As they say, a Rivian once volunteered for the scaffold so a condemned criminal would not hang alone, but I had no desire to die. Geralt had to find a way to free me, especially since I was Roche's aforementioned Informer."
If Geralt sneaks around the harbor and fights only the executioner:
"The witcher decided to try a stratagem. He wanted to draw the guards away and then mount the scaffold, catching the executioner by surprise."
If Geralt decides to directly confront the executioner and the guards:
 "The witcher is a frank, straightforward man. Without much forethought, he chose the direct solution: he thrashed the guards and then tackled the executioner."
 "Saved by Geralt, I breathed a sigh of relief, while Zoltan wiped sweat from his brow. The world would keep the greatest of its living poets. There was no end to the greetings, and that's when I learned about the events which had brought Geralt and his company to Flotsam. As a well informed man, I could aid them in their search, thereby repaying my debt of gratitude. Roche and Geralt questioned me about Iorveth and Letho, and I told them everything I knew."

Melitele's Heart is a quest in "".
Walkthrough.
Prologue.
When wandering around the camp before the assault, you can meet "Newboy", a Crinfrid Reaver who has made a silly bet where he will not wear any armor during the assault. In his defense he says he found a magic item which should help protect him, but requests you have a look at it. If you agree but then persuade him that it might actually be cursed, he gives it to you (-10% armor) and decides to wear armor instead.
When you finally free yourself from prison, you bump into "Newboy", who tells you wearing armor saved his life. He offers to repay you by distracting the dock guards, allowing you to slip by.
If you allow Newboy to go into battle without his armor, he will be slain and you can find his body on the docks before you board the ship with Triss. (on the platform, right before the ramp/bridges leading to Triss, is where I found him)
Note: If during the above first encounter in the camp you tell him that it is magic, but you do not know what it does, "Newboy" will decide to wear his armor, but will "not" give up the amulet. He will survive the assault, but you will then have to kill him to get the amulet just before you board Vernon's boat at the end of the prologue. This is in contrast to what the game guide provided with the premium edition states. The guide tells you that he gives you the amulet as a keepsake, but he actually gives you "About Dragons" instead. He will still distract the guards for Geralt, but they can still be alerted, which forces Newboy to attack with them (to keep up appearances), and Geralt can then retrieve the amulet from his corpse.
Chapter I.
If Geralt arrives in Flotsam with the amulet in his possession, the quest can continue with Anezka of Lobinden. If shown the amulet, she will express interest in buying it for 50; Geralt will then automatically haggle the price up to 200. If pressed about why she is interested (persuasion check), she will reveal that it is in fact cursed and that she may be able to restore it. To do so, she requires the following ingredients:
"Note:" In Patch 3.4 Cedric does not provide these ingredients.
Once these are collected and brought to her, she tells the witcher to meet her by a statue of Veyopatis at midnight. The statue can be found in the forest; it is a massive head with a somewhat cylindrical mouth and menacingly blank eyes.
Once there, she warns that you must defend her while she performs the ritual and you must hold off regularly spawning wraiths. You will be fighting three at any given time; when one dies, another spawns to take its place. Despite some beliefs, this event is not based on time, it is based on the number of wraiths killed. On Normal difficulty, it takes approx. 9-10 kills to end the fight. [Note from someone else: I killed a few dozens and lasted until dawn without the ritual succeeding.] Make sure she is performing the ritual while you fight. If she stops, the ritual has failed no matter how many wraiths you kill.
Tactics:.
Note that bombs are not required to do this, they simply expedite the fight.
Once the ritual is done, talk to Anezka and she will hand over the talisman, its magic restored. The armor penalty is gone and it now gives +1 Vitality Regeneration. As before, it does not need to be equipped.
Journal entry.
Prologue
If Geralt tells Newboy the amulet is magical:
"In Foltest's camp, Geralt ran into the Crinfrid Reavers. Having lost his memory, the witcher no longer recalled the trouble this bunch of rogues had caused during the famous hunt for the golden dragon. As it turned out, Kennet, Desbrut and Boholt had recruited a new comrade. With great originality, they called him Newboy. The four were to join in the assault on La Valette Castle that day. The problem was that the drunken Reavers had bet one of Foltest's knights that Newboy would survive the battle while attacking solely in his trousers and shirt. A protective amulet they had plundered from a roadside shrine was to help him. Asked for his advice, Geralt told them the amulet was indeed magic, thus confirming the Reavers' conviction that Newboy would emerge from the battle unharmed and they would win the wager."
If Geralt tells Newboy the amulet is not magical:
 "In Foltest's camp, Geralt ran into the Crinfrid Reavers. Having lost his memory, the witcher no longer recalled the trouble this bunch of rogues had caused during the famous hunt for the golden dragon. As it turned out, Kennet, Desbrut and Boholt had recruited a new comrade. With great originality, they called him Newboy. The four were to join in the assault on La Valette Castle that day. The problem was that the drunken Reavers had bet one of Foltest's knights that Newboy would survive the battle while attacking solely in his trousers and shirt. A protective amulet they had plundered from a roadside shrine was to help him. Asked for his advice, Geralt expressed doubt about the amulet's protective properties and discouraged the Reavers from undertaking their daring escapade. Newboy reasonably decided to don his armor."
"Upon emerging from the dungeon, Geralt ran into - you guessed it - Newboy. The Reaver remembered that the witcher's advice had saved his life and responded in kind. He offered to draw away the guards blocking the way to Vernon Roche's vessel."
"With Newboy's help, the witcher managed to sneak aboard unmolested. And so the advice he had offered the Reaver in passing had now saved his own life."
If Geralt tells Newboy the amulet is magical, but doesn't know what it does, and then kills Newboy before getting on the ship: 
"The witcher was not careful enough, and a fight broke out despite Newboy's help. Thus, the false amulet's owner, having heeded the witcher's advice, ultimately died by his hand."
Chapter I
 "Travelling can be educational. In Flotsam, Geralt learned that the talisman he had considered to be worthless actually had power and a name. Anezka could restore its abilities by performing a magical ritual, but she needed ingredients: the tongue of a troll, the eyes of an arachas, the fetus of an endrega, and the essence of death."
 If Geralt doesn't complete this quest before choosing Iorveth's path during the quest "" or entering the grounds of Loredo's residence during the quest "Death to the Traitor!" (the quest fails):
 "The witcher's attention was drawn to other, more important matters, and he gave up on solving the mystery of Newboy's talisman. A mystery he would never return to again."
 If Geralt sells Newboy's talisman to Anezka:
 "Newboy's talisman came a long way and finally ended up in the hands of Anezka from the village of Lobinden. Geralt got a tidy sum of orens for it."
 "Collecting fragments of monster corpses was quite normal for our hero. Geralt traveled the length and breadth of Flotsam and its surroundings and found all the ingredients. Even so, obtaining a troll's tongue was no simple task."
 "Geralt searched the surroundings of Flotsam far an wide and found all the ingredients, though getting a troll's tongue was not easy. He gave the components to Anezka. The girl agreed to meet the witcher at the altar of Veyopatis in the middle of the forest. She said she'll be there every night, for she'd be able to perform the ritual releasing the talisman's power only there, in the moonlight."
 "Geralt arrived at the meeting place and Anezka began the rite. however, the witcher would not watch the ceremony in peace. He had to defend the girl from wraiths drawn to a source of magic like moths to a flame. They were the ghosts of the dead from the times when humans only started to colonize the Pontar Valley and faith in Veyopatis was strong."
 "Thanks to Anezka's abilities and Geralt's persistence, the ritual was not interrupted and calmly came to an end. The talisman's power was awakened and the witch gave the witcher the powerful artifact named Melitele's Heart. Future events would show how helpful the amulet's protective aura."

A Rough Landing is a quest from Chapter 1 in ; "the chapter opens with both it and A Sword for Monsters.
Walkthrough.
After landing in the forests west of Flotsam, Triss, Roche, and Geralt encounter Iorveth on their way to the town. Regardless of the witcher's dialogue options, you will be ambushed by a band of Scoia'tael. After casting a spell to ward off the arrows, Triss collapses; Roche then carries her while Geralt fights off elves who close for melee from ahead and behind.
As the trio reaches the docks, the presence of guards deters further pursuit from the Scoia'tael. Geralt looks back and spots the kingslayer (who we hear chat briefly with Iorveth) as the archers disappear back into the forest.
As this quest ends, Assassins of Kings advances and By the Gods - Stringing Up Sods begins.
 "Vernon Roche's ship finally reached the vicinity of Flotsam, a trading post governed by commander Loredo. Roche wanted to meet his informant, yet, unsure of the commander's loyalties, chose not to dock in the harbor, but rather to land on a beach and conduct a bit of reconnaissance before bringing the ship in. He took to scouting in the company of Geralt and Triss."
 "It is prudent to inform the reader that, on account of his profession and personality traits, Vernon Roche had many enemies and possibly no friends at all. By 'many enemies', I mean a legion, and not a weak one at that. In Flotsam alone, Roche counted commander Loredo and the local elven unit's leader, Iorveth, among his foes. The latter crossed our heroes' path. And when a hunter of Squirrels meets the guerrillas' best known leader, the pleasantries can only last so long. The elven partisans immediately attacked from hiding, and Geralt's company only avoided becoming arrow-riddled hedgehogs thanks to Triss Merigold's presence of mind. Vernon Roche took the sorceress, exhausted by her protective spell, into his arms, and Geralt covered the company with his sword. Leaving a trail of corpses behind, our heroes pushed towards Flotsam."
 "At the town gates, our heroes were greeted by Temerian soldiers. Only then did the Scoia'tael withdraw, and the witcher managed but a glimpse of the faces of Iorveth and the kingslayer who accompanied him. Unable to confront their foe, the company proceeded to the town in search of Roche's informant."

Returning Memories

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
Returning Memories is a quest which spans the entire game in "". It's arguably the main story-line for Geralt of Rivia throughout the entire trilogy of games.
Walkthrough.
Generally, you will know that progress is being made in this quest whenever a cut-scene includes pictures with a more 'graphic novel feel' and a voice-over narration by Geralt concerning an event in the past. A sure sign is when these images are preceded by the camera zooming in on Geralt's left eye ...
The first of these moments comes at the end of Roche's interrogation of Geralt, just before the witcher's escape from The Dungeons of the La Valettes. Roche shares an old report that documents Geralt's involvement in a riot, including his supposed death "and Yennefer's". The witcher has a brief opportunity to discuss this with Triss after they arrive in Flotsam.
Generally, both Triss and Dandelion, when they are available for conversation, can be caught up on Geralt's most recent recall of past events.
Journal entry.
Prologue
 "The interrogation in the dungeon of La Valette Castle took its toll on Geralt. The witcher's body, despite its mutations, was beat up, bruised and scarred. At one point, Geralt experienced a shock so extreme that it elicited an old memory - all of a sudden, the witcher recalled the moment of his death. Once more he relived his demise in Rivia. Once more he lay on the ground, pierced by a peasant's pitchfork. Once more he bled to death. When another vision came to him a few days later, Geralt knew he was gradually recovering his memory."
Chapter I
 "Another vision also came during an interrogation, but this time Iorveth's adjutant was the one interrogated. The smell of apples brought a memory of the Isle of Avallach, a mysterious land where Geralt arrived after the events in Rivia. The witcher once more lived through the wondrous experience of that place, but he was not to cherish them for long. Wonder turned into fury when Geralt saw a woman being kidnapped by the Wild Hunt. The abducted was very important to him. The witcher realised that searching for her became his main goal in life."
 "Triss Merigold decided to accelerate the process by which Geralt would recover his memory. She wanted to use magic and needed a rose of remembrance for her spells."
 "However Triss Merigold was kidnapped before she could prepare an infusion from the wondrous flower. Geralt did not regain his memory and had to make do with the random visions that occured during his pursuit of the assassins of kings."
Chapter II
 "After the kingslayer had expired", "Geralt experienced the vision of a journey, a trek across the world in the pursuit of the Wild Hunt. Yet the Hunt, remained elusive all the while. The witcher felt the bitterness of disappointment and defeat, but also staunch determination. He now realised just how much he had invested in the search for the woman abducted from the Isle of Avallach."
 "Another vision came to him after Geralt defeated the draug and passed out. The witcher realized he had known all the kingslayers earlier and had even saved Letho's life when the killer was poisoned by a manticore. In his vision, Geralt joined forces with the three mysterious men. Together they tracked the Wild Hunt."
Chapter III
 "The meeting with Letho opened up another door in Geralt's mind. The witcher saw the hangman's tree, and the King of the Hunt, his wraiths and the people they had abducted. Amoung them was the woman he had been searching for - the sorceress Yennefer. Geralt had not come there alone - Letho, Auckes and Serrit were at his side. Together they fought the Hunt. When the combat ended in a stalemate, the witcher made a pact with the spectral king - he gave himself in exchange for the lives of Yennefer and Letho. He joined the Wild Hunt, but his beloved was free. Geralt belonged to the Wild Hunt for years, crossing the sky as a harbinger of war and other disasters. At that time he lost his memory and disappeared from the world of the living. Until reappearing before the walls of Kaer Morhen."

Troll Trouble

Troll Trouble is a quest in Chapter I of "". It was initially released as free DLC, and then added to the game as part of patch 1.1 on 25 May 2011.
 Troll Contract
 "The authorities seek a brave soul to kill the degenerate troll lurking near the ruined bridge at the Aedernian border. The beast may be defeated by any means, just as long as it is defeated. The troll slayer will be generously rewarded (relevant taxes and levies have already been deducted) and receive the gratitude of the terrorized people of Flotsam."
 "Louis Merse, Town Chancellor"
Walkthrough.
Geralt learns of the quest by reading the note on the Flotsam notice board. He then decides to go to the bridge. On the way, he finds a villager being attacked by nekkers. After rescuing the poor sod, he learns that the man had been sent by the merchants from the port to find out what was going on with the bridge and why, given that it is the only path out of the port inland. The villager also makes a point of mentioning that the bridge is in ruins and that the troll is demanding liquor to let anyone pass. Lastly, the man tells the witcher that he can learn more about the troll from Chorab, the village elder in Lobinden.
Chorab explains that without the troll, there would be no bridge at all, so it would be preferable if Geralt could simply get the troll to stop drinking and get back to work. The witcher is then faced with two choices:
Helping the troll.
If he decides to help the troll, they will have a chat. Please note, the initial conversation will always lead to combat - once beaten down to a small extent, the troll explains that he only started drinking when his mate was cruelly killed by some men while he was away minding the bridge. Now he's lonely and heartbroken and only vodka or vengeance can make him feel better. At this point, Geralt decides either that he doesn't care (and thus proceed with troll-slaying) or that he will deal with the she-troll's murderers.
Geralt may also get more information about the troll from Síle and Zoltan; then having a look around Sendler's house, he sees a she-troll's head mounted on the man's wall. When asked where he got it, Sendler says it was Dmitri who killed her (and quite audaciously at that).
When Geralt pursues his line of questioning, Sendler admits that he doesn't actually know where Dmitri is, but that his henchmen drink at the inn and that they could no doubt tell the witcher where to find him. Geralt then goes off to the inn to find one of Dmitri's men.
He finds one without much effort, watching the fistfights in the basement. After a bit of intimidation, the man reveals that Dmitri is most likely in the graveyard. So then it's off to the graveyard.
Once there, Geralt finds not only Dmitri, but more of his henchmen. A fight ensues, but as ever, Geralt is victorious. He has a quick look around, whereupon he finds a key, a letter, a report and some other loot.
Geralt then returns to the troll.
There is one more surprise awaiting Geralt: Chorab now only offers half of the previously-agreed reward. Geralt can either live with that (100) or convince the alderman (with either intimidation or persuasion) to pay the full amount (200).
Killing the troll.
Geralt simply goes back to the troll, kills it and is done with it. He then returns to Flotsam and collects his reward from Louis Merse.
Either way, 125 xp gained for completing the quest.
 "In practicing their trade, witchers abide by a code that clearly explains what they can and cannot do. Geralt claims he invented this code himself, to have an excuse for refusing unwanted jobs, but I think such a stratagem would be too complicated for him. Either way, Geralt noticed that Bernard Loredo had posted a bounty on the head of a troll living in the area. Because a troll is a sapient creature, it falls under the code as huntable only if evil. The curious witcher decided to check it out."
 "On a forest road he met a farmer from Lobinden and learned some things about the problems with the local Troll. The monster once worked on a bridge on the river, but took to drinking and started causing trouble. The peasant had intrigued Geralt - he beseeched him to talk with Chorab, the elder of Lobinden, before killing the troll."
If Geralt speaks with Chorab:
"Chorab had a peculiar request. Not only did he not want the monster to die, but he wanted the witcher to cure the troll's alcoholism! Things were starting to get interesting."
 If Geralt avoids killing the troll:
 "Geralt had a talk with the troll, man to man. It turned out that the monster fell into addiction after his wife had been killed. An event like that must have been the talk of Flotsam. Geralt decided to question his acquaintances."
 "The witcher learned that the female troll had been killed by one Dmitri, who then sold her head as a trophy to Sendler. It was that poacher who told Geralt that one of Dmitri's men hung around the inn. Geralt headed for Flotsam."
 "The ruffian spilled the beans and Geralt learned that Dmitri was up to something in the cemetery near Lobinden."
 "Geralt killed Dmitri and his bandits at the burial ground - the lucky bastards wouldn't have to go far now. The female troll was avenged, and the witcher went to see her husband."
 "The troll was as happy as befit his size, that is immensely. He traded alcoholism for workaholism and began repairing the bridge. Geralt knew Chorab would be pleased and he went to get his well earned reward."
 "Geralt picked his well earned reward from Chorab and left, content that he aided the local community, had a hand in the development of infrastructure, solved an alcohol problem and got paid on top of it all."
 If Geralt kills the troll:
 "The witcher's lot is not to ponder - it is to protect humans from monsters. Geralt fulfilled his duty and killed the troll. Thus he earned the reward that awaited him at Louis Merse's office."

<doc id="12337" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12337" title="Flotsam brothel">
Flotsam brothel

The brothel in Flotsam is located in the basement of the Flotsam inn. As with the rest of Flotsam's environs, it can only be visited during Chapter I of "".
Several bedrooms are clearly designated for the brothel's business, judging by their fancy red-themed furnishings and dim lighting. One of these is also the office of the madam, Margot; the closed, warmly-lit hallway outside of her room is the main 'selection' area where transactions are initiated.
Margot is not for hire but will engage in conversation and is peripherally involved in a couple of quests; several of her employees are also unavailable. The whores Geralt can hire at any time number three or four: Arnesse and Julia are always conversing just on the left as you enter the main door, and a third randomly-named woman in a red cap (smaller than Arnesse's) - there is sometimes a pair of this last model, usually with a different name for each.
The four or five whores Geralt can't hire all have randomly determined names, and all have longer dark or dark-red hair (one elf model, two human).
The larger room on the upper floor of the inn also appears to be part of the brothel, owing to the same style of furnishings and presence of one or more ladies in typical attire: one standing on the balcony overlooking the town square, others sleeping inside while not on duty. (And also owing to the presence of Derae and/or Margot towards the end of the chapter.)
Walkthrough.
When spoken to, each available woman has her own opening line (the two identical-looking ones share the same script); Geralt's two possible responses, while worded differently in each case, amount to "yes please" or "no thanks".
"Flotsam's brothel was one of only two noteworthy attractions available to visitors and locals. Yet unlike the scaffold, the bordello kept regular hours, offered a regular repertoire and had a regular staff."

Margot is a secondary character in "". She is the proprietor of the brothel in Flotsam.
Geralt meets her during the execution in the City Square of Flotsam. She mocks Bernard Loredo and his men and in this way helps Geralt to save his friends, Zoltan Chivay and Dandelion. Later on, during the "Hung Over" quest, she recounts to Geralt what happened during the night at the brothel, while Roche's men and he were drunk.
You can commonly find her in the first room on the right after entering the brothel, on the lower level of the inn.
If he loots her room, Geralt also find some notes. It turns out that not only does Margot have suspicions about Síle de Tansarville, but that she is a Scoia'tael collaborator too.
Margot likes to peep at people through a hole in the wall of her lover Derae's room. While this is not a nice habit, it turns out to be very helpful when Geralt looks for Triss, at the end of Chapter I.
If Geralt gives Iorveth his sword in Chapter I during "The Assassins of Kings", Margot later offers him a letter to Iorveth. If he does not return Iorveth's sword, Margot kills herself and you can read her intentions in a farewell letter.
 "Margot, the proprietor of the brothel, was a hard-nosed businesswoman, yet she shepherded her flock of girls with almost motherly care."
If Geralt gives Iorveth his sword during "The Assassins of Kings" in Chapter I:
"It turned out that Margot was a spy for Iorveth. She decided to use that connection to avenge her lover's death."
If Geralt does not give Iorveth his sword during "The Assassins of Kings" in Chapter I:
"Margot had been a spy for Iorveth. Fearing this would come to light after the elven commander was captured, she took her life."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Fight Club is a fistfighting quest from Chapter I of "".
Walkthrough.
The sidequest starts automatically after the quest . After winning two fights King Ziggy appears to speak to Geralt suggesting that they meet outside, in front of the inn. From there he leads the witcher to commander Loredo's secret fight club behind his residence. There Geralt can fight some new, tougher opponents. Just before the final bout, Loredo tries to bribe Geralt to throw the fight.
Upon rejecting Loredo and winning the fight, the commandant makes a few ominous threats and has his guards escort Geralt to the gate. The witcher is then attacked by a couple of named thugs in the streets, who spout "Loredo sends his regards."
Notes.
If you want to fulfill this quest you need to win all fights. Throwing the final fight results in a failed quest.
Defeating Zdenek nets you a reward of 200 orens from Ziggy along with a surprise attack from two thugs when you head towards the inn, while throwing the fight gets you 250 orens from Loredo. Throwing or losing the last fight also gets you an amusing scene with Dandelion. Finishing the quest also nets you 100 experience.
 "King Ziggy, a man of noble birth who was surrounding himself with men of despicable status, took note of Geralt's fist fighting successes. He offered him a chance to participate in another tournament. These were supposed to be fights for especially selected men. The participants' glory and reward would be guaranteed. Ziggy tended to appear in front of the inn at the evenings, and it was there that Geralt met him again."
 "King Ziggy took Geralt to Loredo's residence, making it was clear that the commander was the patron of fist fighting duels in Flotsam."
 If Geralt backs out of the tournament:
 "Yet fist fighting in a damp cellar was not what witchers like most. Geralt pulled out of the tournament."
 If Geralt loses during the tournament:
 "It turns out Flotsam bumpkins have fists of stone and Geralt lost shamefully. Thus his adventure with the tournament ended, but other fist fighting challenges would await him in the future."
 "So Geralt participated in the tournament under Loredo's enlightened patronage. The rules were simple - each contender would remain in the game until his first defeat. A hefty reward and a fondness of thrashing bumpkins meant the witcher did not hesitate."
 "The first opponent turned out to be a frail fist fighter called Twigs. In the old days he was known for his right hook, but his career was brutally ended during the duel with the Witcher. Our hero won and quickly prepared for the subsequent fight."
 "Matho entered the ring with a sure step. Self confidence is a must-have trait for a fist fighter but not sufficient alone to make a champion. Geralt defeated Matho with a skill compared to that of a young bear pulling honey from a hive. His opponent's blows were like the irritating buzzing of bees. However, the subsequent opponent looked more dangerous."
 "Once Smugface entered the ring, the audience cheered with enthusiasm. They fully expected to see a fist fighting piece of art. Instead of a ballet, the spectators got a heavy and brutal duel, which Geralt won, yet not without difficulties. The victory did not end the tournament, however."
 If Geralt agrees to throw the fight:
 "Everything went smoothly until the final fight with a former champion from Vizima - a man called Zdenek. Loredo offered the Witcher money to throw the fight in order to make Zdenek a witcher vanquisher and enhance his career. Our hero agreed initially, curious to see what would happen, yet he did not know whether he could be sure he would remain faithful to his pledge."
 "And thus Geralt, seduced by the promise of financial gain, let Zdenek thrash him. The resulting bruises would adorn his torso for a while, though his mood was improved a bit by the bulging coin pouch he found in his satchel when he came to. At base, this job had differed little from regular witchers' work, for as usual, Geralt had risked his neck and taken a few knocks for a fistful of orens."
 If Geralt refuses to throw the fight:
 "Everything went smoothly until the final fight with a former champion from Vizima - a man called Zdenek. Loredo offered the Witcher money to throw the fight in order to make Zdenek a witcher vanquisher and enhance his career. Our hero refused the offer, which was not so difficult to understand."
 "Ah, where are the erstwhile snows and ancient champions! The aura of greatness, which Zdenek exuded, burst like a soap bubble touching a porcupine once the fist fighter hit the floor. Geralt won, against Loredo's intentions, and was very happy with his victory. The commandant, however, ground his teeth in anger."
 If Geralt agreed to throw the fight, but won instead:
"Geralt knocked Zdenek down and out. Loredo, on the other hand, destested losing perhaps more than anything else. With the final bout behind him, the witcher collected his reward and heard out the commandant's threat. Though the tournament was over, Loredo's ire hung over Geralt like an executioner's axe. And like said axe, it would ultimately come down on the witcher."
 "Whether anyone liked it or not, Geralt became the fist fighting champion of Flotsam. Other challenges would await him in the future, but the victory over Loredo was the sweetest."

The Kayran

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The Kayran is one of the main quests in Chapter I of "". It begins when By the Gods - Stringing Up Sods ends.
Walkthrough.
Geralt heads out the door of the inn to see a tentacle attacking a man on the pier. After Síle intervenes, Geralt approaches the group on the pier to enter into a conversation. The townsfolk claim that Síle did nothing to help while the beast attacked. The conversation is resolved through dialogue, Axii, or initimidation and the men leave.
Louis Merse will then approach and ask if Geralt is willing to work with Síle in killing the monster. This will begin the quest . After Louis leaves, Triss will formally introduce Geralt and Síle. Síle suggests that Geralt visit an elf named Cedric to find out more about the Kayran.
As Geralt exits the gate from Flotsam, he will again meet up with Triss, who warns him about dealing with Sile. Geralt then follows Triss to Cedric, who is talking with Seherim about the disappearance of Moril. Cedric suggests that Geralt investigate the wreck of a boat that the Kayran sank. Cedric also sells the , which will be useful for the upcoming fight.
Triss then opens a portal to investigate the wreck, leaving Geralt to walk through the forest. Two small groups of bandits await Geralt before he finds Triss. Triss will then lead the way down to the wreck of the boat, where a fight with a group of drowners will ensue. After defeating the drowners, Triss cast a diagnostic spell, which reveals that the Kayran's mucus is highly poisonous. Triss suggests that Geralt use an ostmurk potion, which begins . Triss then teleports away while Geralt stays behind to investigate the area. Within the boat wreck are two chests which will begin the quest Mystic River.
Geralt can then brew the antidote potion or proceed directly to Sile to begin the battle.
After you talk to Síle, you join up with her in the forest near where you investigated the shipwreck with Triss. She will mention something about keeping the Kayran in place while you go down to kill it.
The Kayran has six tentacles, the two on each side have growths in the middle that you need to attack. Before you can attack these tentacles, you have to go to the left or right of the Kayran and cast Yrden sign on the ground. When the Kayran moves its tentacle to strike, roll or move out of the way. The tentacle will be trapped by the sign, during which you can strike the swollen-growth part of the tentacle. Upon accumulating enough damage, a mini cutscene would be played to show the tentacle being cut off. After you have cut one of the tentacles off the Kayran will be enraged so just move to the side and avoid the main tentacles, which can kill you in one blow.
The Kayran trap can instantly sever one of the tentacles; place it at one of the highlighted locations and it'll take the tentacle off when it comes down.
After you cut off three of the tentacles, there will be a sequence of 3 separate (if you are on Easy difficulty, or on Normal/Hard difficulty with "difficult QTE" turned off, you would only be prompted with the second QTE)
Upon successful completion of the QTEs, a cutscene depicting the bridge collapsing on top of the Kayran will trigger. You can choose to hide behind a chunk of bridge that fell off or run directly toward left edge the ramp formed by the fallen chunk.
While running up the ramp, keep to the left as the right side leads to a dead end. Attempting to cast Quen on top of the ramp is dangerous as you might get hit by the tentacles/rocks, it is safer to just continue running to the top.
Once you reach the top of the ramp, a cutscene will play and you will have defeated the Kayran.
Notable loot includes kayran skin (a crafting component for kayran carapace armor or kayran carapace reinforcement) and kayran trophy.
 "What about the monstrosity of Flotsam? Well, Geralt heard that the beast had attacked a man on the pier. Driven by professional curiosity, he went to investigate..."
 "Indeed, it was as the people had said - the unlucky victim lay on the pier. A riled crowd surrounded him and was commenting on the events. Among the onlookers stood the sorceress Síle de Tansarville. The witcher and the sorceress exchanged but a few words before she asked Geralt for help in hunting down the dangerous beast. First, they needed to identify the species. An elf named Cedric was said to be the most knowledgeable about the local wildlife."
 "Cedric lived in Lobinden, a village nestled up against Flotsam's Walls. Humans paid him to keep the forest beasts away from their huts, so he spent most of his time on tree-top platforms gazing into the forest thicket."
 "The witcher found the elf and questioned him about the monster. He learned that a poisonous mucus covered the beast, so that a single touch of its tentacle could fell a towering man. Geralt decided he needed an antidote, but to make this, he would first need a sample of the mucus. So he embarked on an expedition to the monster's lair, and Triss joined him."
 "In the kayran's lair, Geralt learned that the monster's mucus was highly toxic. Triss gave our hero the formula for a potion that would render him immune to the beast's terrible venom, but he needed a herb known as ostmurk to make the draught. I've continued the story of the herb in another section, dear reader. Here you will learn how the hunt for the kayran progressed."
 "After speaking with Síle, Geralt was ready to fight the kayran. armed with a sword and knowledge, he set out to slay the monster."
 "You should have seen the battle! The bridge's arches crumbled like houses of cards and the beast's blood mingled with its poisonous mucus. Finally, the witcher, with much effort, won the day - the beast was dead, and our hero could pick up the reward he had rightly earned."

The Nekker Contract is one of two contract quests in Chapter I of "". You can receive this quest by reading the Notice board in front of Flotsam inn, in Chapter I.
 Nekker Contract
 "It is hereby announced that Commandant Bernard Loredo has posted a generous bounty for the extermination of the nekkers in the vicinity of the trading post. These monsters must be eliminated once and for all. The one to accept this job – and successfully complete it – will be rewarded with a bulging pouch of orens, and a priest will be paid to conduct prayers in our hero's name for twenty eight days."
 "Louis Merse, Town Chancellor"
Walkthrough.
The contract can be found on the notice board outside the inn in Flotsam. The first step is to find additional information about the beasts. That information can be obtained from the book Nekkers in the Mist (can be purchased from Einar Gausel in Flotsam, or looted during the Prologue) or simply by killing a certain number of nekkers. These can be found near a couple of nests in the forest, and cave systems just west of Flotsam and behind the waterfall to the south/west of town. To complete the contract, purchase and/or craft four grapeshot bombs, place them in a quickslot, and use them to destroy the creatures' access to the surface. Purchase the (or the bombs themselves) from Cedric.
Three of the nests are relatively close together, with the last being farther south, northeast of the waterfall. Use the witcher's medallion to highlight them on the ground if you have trouble identifying them. To destroy them, simply move close and click when prompted (NOTE: you cannot do this in combat or by throwing bombs by pressing , it will not destroy the nests) but do not remain near the tunnel when the bomb explodes or Geralt will take damage. It should also be noted that when you get near the tunnels, many nekkers will surface and you'll have to fight them in order to plant the bomb if you missed the small window before they arrived.
When all four nests have been dealt with, report to Louis Merse for a 150 reward.
 "In spite of events, Geralt had not forgotten his profession. Witchering was the prime source of income, so when he learned that the Flotsam authorities had posted a bounty for exterminating nekkers, he accepted the job immediately. Before he began, he decided to learn more about the vicious creatures. He began looking for books about nekkers and searching for the creatures to observe their behavior."
 "Geralt learned that the local nekkers used a system of underground tunnels to move about. He thought that if he could find a way to destroy all of the entrances to these tunnels, most of the nekkers would be buried alive. Those remaining would likely then scatter, making it all the easier to exterminate them."
 "The witcher acted on his idea. The nekkers were thus buried in their underground dens, and Geralt went to see Louis Merse about his well earned reward."
 "Louis Merse nodded approvingly, filled in the THX-114 form and, having paid the witcher, wished him much luck. Then our hero left, thinking about what to spend his hard earned orens on."

&lt;/infobox&gt;The Endrega Contract is one of two contract quests in Chapter I of "".
 Endrega Contract
 "Faced with the insolence and bestial menace of the creatures known as endregas, and concerned for the people, Commandant Bernard Loredo has decided to post a bounty for the extermination of these creatures. The brave soul who permanently rids the area of this filth will receive a generous reward from the hands of Louis Merse and will be listed in the town chronicles as a true hero of Flotsam."
 "Louis Merse, Town Chancellor"
Walkthrough.
The contract to initiate this quest can be found in Flotsam, on the notice board outside the inn.
Before running to the forest you need to find more information on the endrega. The book Three Years Among the Endregas can be obtained from Einar Gausel in Flotsam. It is also possible to obtain the book from a corpse located in the cave you are sent into for the Malena quest. Instead of buying the book, you can also keep killing endregas until you "acquire" the knowledge.
The endrega nests can be found on both sides of the swampy area in the center of the forest. One nest is located on the west side of the swamp, next to the tree on the map. The other nest is on the east side of the swamp, a little north from the tree on the map. Each nest has 3 large cocoons nestled up against the trees.
To complete this, you must open all 3 cocoons in each area and defeat each of the queen endregas that appear. Remember to clear the area of regular endregas beforehand to make this easier.
Strategies:.
There are several possible strategies for dealing with the Queen:
"Endregas were multiplying in the Flotsam area. The monsters had become such a scourge that Bernard Loredo, though stingy by his nature, posted a bounty for their extermination. The witcher accepted the job and decided that a little theoretical preperation might pay off. Reading about the endregas' habits would be worth it."
"Endregas are very similar to butterflies, except that they are ugly, cannot fly, and would choke on cabbage. All right[], maybe they are like butterflies, but they do weave cocoons. The witcher learned that destroying the cocoons would draw the endrega queens, and their deaths would mean the end of the swarm."
"The idea proved to be right on target. The witcher dealt with the endregas and went to see Louis Merse about his reward."
"Louis Merse filled out the WL-17 form and paid the witcher, but not before deducting a monstrous tax. Thus ended the endrega adventure."

Mystic River

"Something wrong with my face?"&lt;br&gt;This article or its infobox is missing an image. You can help by it.&lt;br&gt;Please do not upload images from other fan sites unless it's official artwork.
Mystic River is a quest which spans Chapters I, II and III of "".
Walkthrough.
Chapter I:
This quest begins in a shipwreck in the Kayran's lair. Inside it is a skeleton which will net you the captain's key. That key opens a chest farther in the wreck. In that chest is a journal; bring it to Flotsam and place it into the Royal Mail box.
For those looking for the Royal Mail, you can find it at Louis Merse's home (he is also the one you go to when you fulfill a monster contract). His home is located near the center of Flotsam, where the hangings took place, and includes a blue colored sign with a quill and four Temerian lilies depicted on it. His front door is behind two (unresponsive) vendors. The Royal Mail box is upstairs on his desk. You can also insert the report in the Box in Loredo's office.
Chapter II:
Find the wreck of the Eyla Tarn in the ravines outside Vergen. It is in the southwest corner of the map behind the troll's lair and near the far side of the old quarry.
Loot the locked chest inside the wreck. Inside is a Vran armor enhancement. It can be used immediately, but this would be a waste and cut short the quest to boot; it will be more useful if saved until Chapter III, when it is needed to craft the Epic armor that concludes the quest.
Chapter III:
Enter the sewers beneath Loc Muinne. The right entrance is near the main market area, north of the Mighty Numa, through a studded grey metal door. Once inside, proceed down the stairs and follow the passage northwest at the first intersection. There may or may not be rotfiends in the way, but there will definitely be two bullvores at the end. After defeating them, loot a locked chest to receive the and Armor of Ysgith. To complete the quest, find any craftsman to craft the Vran armor.
Journal entry.
Chapter I
"In the monster's lair, Geralt spotted the wreck of a large riverboat. Within its shattered hull lay a corpse which, as it turned out, was that of the boat's captain. On the corpse, Geralt found a key. Picking it up he instinctively looked around for the lock it might open."
"The key the witcher found on the corpse matched a rusty chest nearby. In it, Geralt found the journal of the Petra Silie's captain, and a copy thereof packed for shipment to the University of Oxenfurt. Our hero concluded that the captain had intended to provide a report of his journey, but failed to dispatch the manuscript for unknown reasons. The witcher decided to do him that small favor using the Royal Mail that all Temerian officials could access. And who was, by the king's will, the ranking official in Flotsam? The answer to this question was simple."
"Having read the captain's journal, Geralt noted that two boats had sailed the Pontar. Our hero felt he could well be lucky enough to come across the wreck of the second vessel. The witcher's hunches were rarely wrong."
"Our hero concluded correctly that the captain had wished to give an account of his journey. However, he had not managed to send the manuscript off. The witcher decided to do it for him, using the Royal Mail, to which only Temerian clerks had access. And who was the ranking royal official in Flotsam? The answer was simple."
"When Geralt found the post box, he thought that it could also contain secret information carried by special couriers. Loredo's letters would be interesting reading, so, without a second though, the witcher resolved to get his hands on the contents of the mailbox."
If Geralt persuades Louis Merse to let him look in the Royal mailbox:
"Geralt found a letter to Viziman officials in the mailbox in Louis Merse's house. It suggested that Merse had contemptuously dismissed the charges of corruption, mismanagement, and colluding with bandits against Loredo. It seemed that Merse openly disdained his superiors in the capital, not fearing any unpleasant consequences. Geralt kept this fact in mind for future reference."
"Above all, however, our hero placed the parcel from the Petra Silie's captain in the box. I can tell you it reached its addressee and it caused quite a stir, but that's a topic for another story."
If Geralt gains access to the Royal mailbox at Loredo's residence:
"Geralt found a letter to one Dethmold in the mailbox in Bernard Loredo's mansion. It suggested that the commander had not been all that upset by Foltest's death, and seemed more interested in King Henselt's health. Apparently Loredo was colluding with the Kaedwinis and had far-reaching plans. The commander also apologized for his mother's behavior, which confirmed the rumors that she was... eccentric."
Chapter II
"Geralt found the notes of the treasonous sorcerer in the wreck of the Eyla Tarn, which the local trolls had dragged onto dry land to use as their love nest. The mage wanted to get his hands on the archeological expedition's findings, which were being transported down river on the Eyla Tarn and the Petra Silie. There was a battle and the first ship, the renegade aboard it, was sunk. The witcher found smithing materials from the time of the Vrans along with the notes. He could put them to immediate use but the notes also mentioned a treasure hidden beneath Loc Muinne that, when combined with these materials, would produce Vran armor."
Chapter III
"Geralt searched for quite a while, but he found the chest beneath Loc Muinne's streets. In it was a treasure that, when combined with Vran armor enhancements, could be forged into a marvelous set of armor. However, a sorcerer-smith was needed for that."
"Finding an appropriately schooled craftsman was easier than Geralt initially thought. Bras of Ban Ard, a legendary sorcerer-smith, was present at the sorcerers' summit. For a moderate fee he made Vran armor for Geralt, so the adventure that stretched along the Pontar's current came to an end."

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
Hung Over is a quest in Chapter I of "".
Walkthrough.
Upon entering the Blue Stripes headquarters in Flotsam, some Blue Stripes are celebrating the soldiers' defacing a statuette of a local god. They ask Geralt to compete with Ves in a knife-throwing competition in which the soldiers call out various objects (oar, ham and map (may not be in this order) as targets.
Locals barge into the quarters demanding retribution for the sacrilegious actions of the troops. An argument ensues between Vernon Roche and the locals and Geralt is given the choice to break up the confrontation or walk away. If Geralt choses to calm Roche down, he can try persuading him, but if that fails, he is forced into a fistfight with the commander.
After some drinks, Ves challenges Geralt to arm wrestle two soldiers, Thirteen and Fenn. The Sword of Creyden is won upon defeating the second soldier. After the arm wrestling, the drinking continues until Geralt blacks out.
The following morning, Geralt finds himself hungover and naked by Flotsam Harbor with a tattoo on his neck. He is approached by a local who, after a bribe or successful intimidation check, will direct him to the Madame of Flotsam brothel. She will then, after another bribe, tell Geralt to see 'the girl in the Blue Stripes' (Ves)
Ves is found in the Blue Stripes lodging next to the tavern. After discussing the events of the night before, including the several attempts at crossing the river atop prostitutes and story behind the tattoo, Ves directs Geralt to a chest where his possessions are held.
50 xp are awarded after speaking with Ves.
If Triss is consulted about the tattoo, she will laugh at the witcher's expense and tell him that she can remove it with the following:
All of the ingredients can be purchased from Anezka in Lobinden, Myron in the Kaedweni camp, or Marcus and The Incredible Lockhart in Loc Muinne. White myrtle is one of the more common herbs growing in gardens and the wild, so need not necessarily be purchased; however, unlike in the prior and subsequent Witcher games, the leaves and mold are not part of the alchemy system and are only found for sale by the four merchants mentioned.
There is no new line of dialogue to remove the tattoo after the ingredients are collected, but by repeating "Do you know how to remove a tattoo?", Geralt will say that he has the items needed. The option will then be given to remove it or keep it. Removal will be instantaneous (sorry - no bonus footage of Triss working on Geralt's neck).
The collection is a hidden quest and will not be displayed in the journal. The tattoo removal may also completed with the same ingredients in Chapter 2 by consulting Philippa (Iorveth's path) or Síle (Roche's path).
"You may remember that Geralt decided to have a friendly drink with Roche's men. He awoke later on with a monstrous hangover and a nagging feeling that he had done something he should not have. He decided to learn the truth and questioned the madame."
"Well, the get-together had gone so well that virtually all its participants had lost touch with reality. Only Ves had remained lucid and tried to rein in her friends and the witcher. To no avail. Geralt went to speak to the young woman."
"So, what had happened? Believe it or not, in a drunken stupor, the witcher had his neck tattooed. From that raucous evening onward, he was forever to wear the brand of the Blue Stripes."

&lt;/infobox&gt;One less fortunate nekker appears in the opening sequence of the game when it is used as bait for an arachas by Iorveth.
Nekkers cease to give XP when killed once Geralt reaches Level 11.
"Imagine a drowner that burrows tunnels, climbs trees, is more vicious than usual, and when ambushing its prey, it does so with many of its kin. Now you have a good idea of what a nekker is. These primitive creatures are the bane of the wilderness - the inhabitants of forest villages fear them, and animals give their nests a wide berth. Nekkers are social creatures, gathering in something akin to tribes, for they can only repel the attacks of stronger assailants en masse."
"When nekkers venture out as a war or hunting party, they are led by chieftains. These are larger and mark their faces with red clay. Chieftains give orders, turning a wild band into an organized unit, thus they should be eliminated first."
"The nekkers' basic tactic is to strike en masse. They burrow from beneath the ground and swarm upon their prey. Though primitive, the tactic is surprisingly effective. One must be ready to repel many foes at once - the fast style is best suited to this. As with other agile creatures, running from nekkers is not the best idea, for the monsters will catch up to their prey and swiftly kill it with multiple hits of their claws."
"Witchers can use their full range of skills and techniques when fighting nekkers. Signs, bombs, poisons and oils that augment bleeding are all extremely effective against the beasts. Nekker nests are best destroyed with Grapeshot bombs."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Nekkers rarely attack alone, they tend to be found in groups near a nest. If the nest is not destroyed using either samum or grapeshot, they continue to spawn.
A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading The World Underground.
 "Take heed, gents, there's nekkers under this here bridge. If you all cross at once, without slowing or stopping, there's nothing to fear. But if your cart throws an axle and you get stuck out there... Well, close your eyes and pray to Melitele.– Kurt Hammerbach, city guardsman in Vengerberg"
 "A lone nekker is harmless. Five are dangerous. Ten can kill even a veteran monster slayer. Particularly troublesome are the larger, stronger individuals known as warriors, as well as the rare breed of nekkers known as phoocas."
 "Nekkers and phoocas live in the dark woods that grow in damp, mist-filled valleys, in colonies of one to several dozen individuals. They dig deep burrows for lairs and connect them with a network of narrow tunnels. Using these passageways they are able to move at great speed within and around their colonies."
 "Nekkers always attack in groups and by surprise. They try to surround their prey as quickly as possible, cutting off all escape routes. Luckily their attack is for the most part disorganized, for nekkers are not gifted with great courage and individual nekkers will often hesitate before overcoming their fear and striking. When fighting them one can use this moment of hesitation to kill the braver individuals before finishing off those who remain in the back."
Combat tactics.
Individual nekkers are weak, easy marks compared to other monsters; nekkers do not tend to fight as individuals. If you see one, expect anywhere from 2-10 more. Nekkers overwhelm their targets through sheer numbers, surrounding them, then pummeling and clawing victims to death. Even veteran witchers can fall prey to this.
Also, unlike fellow ogroids, nekkers are considerably agile and acrobatic, even more so than the likes of drowners and rotfiends. One could easily leap at Geralt from barrel roll distance and roll back even further to avoid counterattacks. When combined with sheer numbers, nekkers are rather challenging, if not dangerous to engage without sabotaging their mobility.
When facing large groups of nekkers, take advantage of bombs such as Northern Wind or Dancing Star. Sufficiently powerful explosives can help thin out a nekker swarm with ease.
Aard can knock a nekker to its back, allowing for swift execution. Aard can also knock over several nekkers at once, a good way to break through large groups of attackers.
If players are heavily invested in swordplay light attacks, the Whirlwind ability could work nicely as both offensive and defensive means against nekkers, especially when the sword bears the Severance runeword enchantment.

Fioravanti is a secondary character in "". He is a merchant and dice poker player who can be found at the south side of the main square in Flotsam, in front of Louis Merse's house.
 "A truly enterprising man, the merchant Fioravanti had found a niche that produced for him a decent income. Though his specialization was extremely narrow, this was the very key to his success. For the secret of commerce is to be the exclusive provider of a certain category of goods or services. Thus, Fioravanti was still in business despite his forced stopover in Flotsam."

Einar Gausel is a secondary character in "". He is a merchant (who primarily sells "books"), dice poker player, and (with patch 1.2 installed) barber who can usually be found in the building north of the dwarven smithy in the non-human district of Flotsam. You can purchase about monsters from him, which are necessary to progress in the quests The Nekker Contract and The Endrega Contract.
Later on in Chapter I, if Geralt chooses Iorveth's path, the non-human district is burned and the non-humans massacred. Geralt is told that Einar Gausel collaborated with Loredo and betrayed his race. However, Margot's letter to Iorveth says different, stating he only yields to Loredo as much as is necessary.
"If Lobinden's nonhumans had been organized as a community, the dwarf Einar Gausel would have been the closest thing to its leader. Though the Scoia'tael considered him a collaborator on a human leash, Einar tried to represent the nonhuman minority as best as he could, even if that meant mediating between its members and the commandant. Furthermore, he ran something akin to a bookshop. Given its location in what was a complete backwater, his selection of titles was quite impressive."
"In addition to being a well-informed bookseller, Einar Gausel was also an accomplished barber. In discovering this, Geralt learned of the only person in Flotsam who would be able to do anything about his hair."

Lobinden

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
Lobinden is a small village just outside the eastern palisade of Flotsam in "".
 "This small settlement nestled against the walls of the trading post was supposedly founded long ago by Aedirnian settlers. Even if true, this is of little consequence. Though the village was a complete backwater compared to the provincial outpost, Lobinden and Flotsam depended on each other because most of the area's fishermen, boat builders, tar-makers and hunters inhabited the settlement, providing products and services which no frontier community could live without. Elves and dwarves made up a large share of Lobinden's population. Tensions between them and the local humans were lower than in the trading post proper, as they were all united in their daily labors."

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
In the Claws of Madness is a quest from Chapter 1 in "".
Walkthrough.
This quest can be initiated by talking to Cedric and asking him for work. He will tell you about two missing men who went off to explore the burned-down hospital nearby.
You will find one of the missing men (the quest can be picked up directly from Rupert if Cedric has not been spoken to first) near five crazed nekkers, next to some ruins poking out of the ground to the south of Flotsam. Follow the map marker over to the fresh corpse of Gridley's dog (there is no way to save the dog, and even though it glows when the witcher's medallion is activated, there is nothing to loot from it). Nearby a set of stairs lead underground.
Go down the stairs, and explore the ruins until you come to a large room with a wooden trap door in the center. Once you loot the chest in the room, two wraiths will spawn and attack you. If you have trouble with them (and many people do), you can use this simple solution with traps, 100% effective no matter what level you are. Once you kill the wraiths, you'll see some ghosts (non-hostile), and a wandering ghost soldier who seems to spawn fire that blocks off certain paths. Follow the open paths to more chests and wraiths.
Eventually you will encounter Gridley (one of the missing explorers), who is rambling and needs some medicine to calm him down. The medicine is in the room on the right before the wall of fire, next to two more wraiths. After you give Gridley the medicine, he will tell you what happened to the sanitarium and explain that the wandering soldier is a cursed ghost that haunts the area.
Talk to the ghost, who demands retribution.
You can either trick Gridley and his friend into coming back down to the ruins (where they will be killed), or you can trick the ghost either by giving him the hearts and eyes of nekkers or pigs, which he will eventually realize are fake, and you will have to fight him. It doesn't matter which eyes and heart you use, neither are the hearts and eyes of murderers which ghost wanted.
If you kill the ghost, Gridley and Rupert can be left alone or taken into custody by Loredo's mother (who is, in fact, the only surviving patient of the asylum - raped by its guards, she later slit their commander's throat and escaped with a treasure map). If you betray Gridley and Rupert, you can loot Gridley's body for the of a silver sword.
 "Do you like ghost stories? You are going to hear a lot of them. Ghosts appear for the first time in this story in Flotsam, in a house standing in the depths of the forest... But let us start at the very beginning. It all began when Geralt was talking with Cedric. The elf told him about two men who had headed for a ruined mansion – a place where the mentally ill had once been kept - and had never come back. The witcher was intrigued. He decided to see what happened to them."
 "Not far from the ruins Geralt found the first traveler. Rupert was sobbing by a tree, evidently looking for something. The moment he saw the Witcher, he started begging for help, for his friend Gridley, who disappeared in the ruins. The Witcher heard the howling of Nekkers and understood that this was no joke. He reached for his sword."
 "After entering the hospital's basement, Geralt experienced something even more paranormal than the usual fare for a witcher. he saw a ghost that sent him a vision. everything around them started to burn and the specter - in true ghostly fashion- passed through the wall into the next room. Geralt recovered and followed the it, though not through the wall."
 "The chest contained some doctors' notes. these stated that the medical staff had carried out experiments on the mentally ill. Geralt read on and learned that a group of soldiers had brought a Nilfgaardian prisoner to the hospital. The soldiers had wanted to interrogate him, but the notes did not reveal how that story ended. Geralt started searching the mansion, looking for signs Gridley might have left."
 "Phantoms, like people, know how to set traps. Geralt followed the specter and was attacked by a horde of hungry wraiths. as he started to defend himself, he noticed a chest standing against a wall."
 "Finally Geralt managed to find Gridley. The poor soul was trying to keep imaginary specters at bay, raving about a fire and a girl that died in it. Geralt had to look for tranquilizers."
 "And he found a bottle of medicine, which he brought back to the hospital."
 "Calmed by the medication, Gridley talked of past events. He and Rupert had been stationed in this place years ago. They had killed the priest who tended to the ill, and tortured a captive Nilfgaardian, hoping to learn the location of a huge treasure. They set a fire to cover their tracks and abducted the most attractive patient. Hearing the story, Geralt understood that the place was cursed and that finding the tormented Nilfgaardian's ghost was the key to the matter."
 "The lost soul desired only one thing - the death of his former oppressors. He still felt their stares upon him, and only death would bring him peace. he wanted to consume the eyes and hearts of his tormentors. Geralt returned for Gridley and took him back to the surface, to Rupert."
 If Geralt surrenders Rupert and Gridley to the ghost:
"The witcher had already decided how to lift the curse. Then he lured Rupert and Gridley into a trap, telling them he disposed of the wraith."
 If Geralt decides to trick the ghost:
 "Geralt decided to lift the curse, but he had no intention of giving Rupert and Gridley to the wraith. He decided to trick the ghost by bringing it the eyes and hearts of animals or monsters. He went to the in Flotsam. Along the way, he decided that nekkers would make good organ donors too."
 If Geralt uses nekker hearts and eyes to try to fool the ghost:
 "Instead of killing Gridley and Rupert, our hero decided to slaughter a few nekkers. Gutting the monsters, he extracted the hearts and eyes from their carcasses. Someone unfamiliar with the differences between human and monster anatomy might mistake these for human organs. With his trophies in hand, the witcher went to see the Nilfgaardian's specter."
 If Geralt purchases pig hearts and eyes to try to fool the ghost:
 "Pig eyes and hearts bought at the butcher's stall were suitable enough, though they would not fool someone familiar with human and animal anatomy. The witcher took them back to the voracious specter."
 "Blinded by his lust for vengeance and hunger, the ghost fell for the trick. He lifted the curse from his oppressors, but when the treachery was revealed he attacked Geralt in fury. He was up against a witcher though, and Geralt dealt with him in no time."
 "After the fight, Geralt had had enough of the haunted hospital. He wanted to close the case for good so rushed to find Gridley and Rupert."
 If Geralt allows Rupert and Gridley to flee:
 "The curse was lifted, the ghost passed into oblivion, and Geralt had had enough of looking at Gridley and Rupert. He told them to get lost and they jumped at the occasion, content to escape with their lives. Thus ended the story of the burned hospital's haunting was concluded.[]"
 If Geralt brings Rupert and Gridley to Loredo":"
 "The curse was lifted and the ghost passed into oblivion, but justice still 'had to be done. The witcher decided to hand Rupert and Gridley over to the Flotsam authorities. Willing or not, they followed the witcher to Loredo's mansion. The soldiers at the gate ridiculed the witcher, but, as they were mocking his desire for law and order, Marietta Loredo peeked outside. She had the criminals brought inside, and nobody dared to oppose her order. In this mysterious manner the story of the burned hospital's haunting was concluded."

Cedric was an elven merchant and craftsman who can usually be found on or near the observation platform in Lobinden.
It is revealed that Cedric was once a member of the Scoia'tael and suffered from frequent visions. However, it is not explained if the visions were about his Scoia'tael past or premonitions of the future like Jacques de Aldersberg (although Triss Merigold suggested the latter). Regardless, he usually spent most of his time drinking heavily trying to avoid having them--something that Geralt of Rivia admitted that he understood very well.
In his quest to destroy the kayran, Geralt was pointed in the direction of Cedric, who helped him find the monster. Later, Cedric told the witcher where he could find some ostmurk in order to make the Mongoose potion. As a craftsman, Cedric sold various items, including formulae for weapon oil and potions (including for Mongoose), bombs, and the design for a kayran trap.
Soon afterwards, Cedric helped to protect Triss when she was attacked by Letho. However, the kingslayer managed to fatally wound Cedric, so he fled into the forest. Cedric was eventually found by Geralt, who had followed a trail of the elf's blood. As he lay dying, Cedric told Geralt about what had happened and noticed how the animal life in the forest came to bid him farewell before he passed away.
"For reasons that were not entirely clear, this wise and experienced elf had chosen to live among humans. He worked for the people of Flotsam as a lookout and trapper, and none had a better knowledge of the surrounding forests. Whether it was the local plants and wildlife or the dangers that lurked amidst the trees, Cedric was the local inhabitants' chief and often only source of information."
"Heroism sometimes exacts the highest price. When Triss' life was in danger, the elf did not hesitate to defend her and was wounded - mortally, as it turned out. Thus Cedric died, though his sacrifice was not in vain."

Endrega

An endrega, endryag, or endriaga, is a species of insectoid said to resemble a huge lizard. They inhabit the forests in the southern parts of Northern Kingdoms, in areas like the Dank Wilderness.
During the 13th century, endrega numbers dwindled due to the expansion of humans, according to Codringher.

Journal entry.
"Endregas are forest creatures that resemble arachnids. They are especially fond of flood-plains, as moisture and tall grass suit them. Longer than they are tall, they move about on all fours and are extremely difficult to spot as they lie motionless, awaiting their prey. Like kikimores, endregas are divided into castes, with warriors being most numerous, guards being less common, and queens being a real rarity."
"These monsters, like arachnids, hatch from eggs. Impregnated queens lay the eggs in cocoons which hang from trees in areas known as nests. The lesser creatures zealously guard their queens, as colonies depend on them for survival. The queens themselves remain hidden, caring little for what happens to other adult specimens. However, when their nest is threatened, they emerge swiftly and fight ferociously. Thus, to exterminate an endrega colony, one must set fire to its cocoons to lure out and kill the queen."
"When fighting an endrega, use the strong style and target the beast's abdomen, where its armor is weakest. Trusting in the toughness of their armor, the creatures often willingly take blows, only to respond with a sudden counter-attack that can be deadly if not evaded or blocked."
"Endregas can bleed to death if hit with a blade coated with the appropriate oil. They are also susceptible to all witcher Signs. The monster can easily be tripped up, knocked down or immobilized by a trap. However, the endrega's peculiar metabolism makes it immune to poison."
"The Witcher Adventure Game".
In "The Witcher Adventure Game" endregas are called endraga.
To defeat them you need:
Failed Sword: Move this monster to an adjacent region.
Failed Sword: Suffer 1 Poisoned Heart.
Endregas are divided into three types:

Where is Triss Merigold? is one of the primary quests in "".
Walkthrough.
Chapter I.
After his battle with Letho in the ruined elven baths, Geralt rushes back to Flotsam to try to save Triss, but he is too late. Meeting Dandelion at the inn, the witcher learns that Triss was last seen on her way to see Síle. The two men then decide to check Síle's room.
Inside Síle's room, they find a sight of carnage: a dead bodyguard, a smashed megascope and obvious signs of a scuffle. They also find a peephole from the brothel next door and depending on Geralt's alliances so far,
 Roche's Path: They see Derae, alive and alone.
 Iorveth's Path: They see Margot and Derae's corpse in the adjoining room.
They then rush over to find out if the woman has seen anything that might help them locate Triss. She tells them that she saw Triss and Cedric enter the room and that Cedric killed the guard. Geralt also learns that Cedric then left, staggering.
 Roche's Path: If Geralt is interrogating Derae, she tells him that Triss spoke to Dethmold via the megascope and a flashback of that conversation is shown. At one point, he agrees to answer one question. You are presented with 3 choices:
* If you ask about the assassination, he knows nothing.
* If you ask about Henselt, he reluctantly tells you that Henselt is planning to take over the Pontar valley. He gives a fair amount of detail, none of which has any obvious bearing on the game.
* If ask about Sile, he tells you she wants three profitable alchemy shops and a seat on the royal council.
 After this, Derae says that Margot has gone missing and the quest "Margot's Disappearance" is launched. At this point, Geralt can try to find Margot. Afterwards he has to find Cedric. Note: this is the only chance to do Margot's Disappearance. When you find Cedric, "At the Crossroads" begins, and "Margot's Disappearance" will be marked Failed if not complete.
 Iorveth's Path: Geralt is speaking to Margot, she tells him that Triss then spoke to Philippa via the megascope and a flashback of their conversation is shown, after which Margot gives Geralt a letter for Iorveth and reveals that she has helped Iorveth on occasion in the past. Geralt then decides to go look for Cedric.
Cedric's trail can be found using a Cat potion, which will highlight blood on the ground (Alternatively, if you're a cheapskate with plenty of time to kill, you can also use the medallion, which also highlights blood). From the gate between Flotsam and Lobinden, Geralt finds a trail of blood leading into the forest. After following the trail, he is led to a location near the waterfall in the forest where he finds Cedric wounded and lying on the ground. The witcher gets the rest of the story from Cedric and then the elf dies.
Chapter II ("Iorveth's Path").
After "The War Council" Geralt continues his search for Triss in order to get a rose of remembrance for Saskia's antidote. He decides to get Philippa's help to find Triss. Upon his arrival, he surprises the sorceress and her apprentice, Cynthia. He then asks her to locate Triss but she says she can't do anything without some item which belonged to Triss. Only then can she pinpoint her magically.
A few more enquiries about town reveal that a dwarf is telling tales of seeing a woman fall from the sky. Geralt locates the dwarf, Mantas Birut at The Cauldron. Mantas then relates his tale of two persons falling from the sky, a man and a woman. He also reveals that a troll found the woman after the man abandoned her.
The witcher then proceeds towards the troll lair in the neighbouring ravines, and there he finds a troll enjoying a bit of elf and onion soup. A few more questions reveal that the troll did find a red-headed woman and nurse her back to health, but had to let her go due to his wife's jealousy. He says that if Geralt wants something belonging to the red-head, he'll have to convince the she-troll to come back home. This will net you the achievement "Friend of Trolls" and they will appear later in the quest "Vergen Beseiged." Alternatively, the witcher could just kill the troll. This will get you the "Trollslayer" achievement if you killed the troll in Chapter I as well.
Continuing south, Geralt comes upon the she-troll (specifically, he goes south then takes the left turn at the crossroads and climbs up a ledge). Once on the top he witnesses the she-troll and some mercenaries fighting. He then must choose to support the mercenaries by killing the she-troll and looting her body for Triss' bandana (but this leads to bad-will with her husband if Geralt had not also killed him earlier), or he can defeat Pangratt and his men. Pangratt surrenders once his health drops below 50% at which point Geralt can speak with the she-troll and receive Triss' bandana.
Having made sure to complete the "With Flickering Heart" side quest, Geralt returns to Philippa Eilhart's house. He gives her Triss' bandana and she promises to try to find Triss. (1500XP reward). After finishing that task, the witcher hears a commotion outside and upon investigating, learns that the peasants have accused Prince Stennis of poisioning Saskia (allowing Royal Blood to continue).
He later reenters Philippa Eilhart's house and again interrupts a little scene between the sorceress and Cynthia. Philippa tells him that Triss is now on the other side of the mist, but that she can help the witcher cross over with the help of a medallion. Geralt then proceeds toward the battlefield, leaving via the west gate. (Note: crossing the mist is the same as it was at the beginning of the chapter, with the witcher having to periodically defeat wraiths while avoiding draugirs and dead soldiers).
Finally on the other side, he finds Vernon Roche and his men cleaning up after a Nilfgaardian ambush. They decide that Geralt must get to Nilfgaardian camp. Vernon then says he'll meet the witcher there and tells him that there are two ways to get there:
Note: Approaching the prostitutes and talking to Madame Carole saves a rather sneaky adventure through the camp to get to the caves, but it is rather costly (a bribe of a minimum of 500 orens).
Or you can search for the small path leading to the coast. When entering the camp pass the canteen, head straight ahead through the alley of tents until you can turn left to the path alongside the palisade. Continue until you reach an entrance (notice the Autosave just before the spot) where 5 guards will enter. Wait for them to pass, then continue straight ahead along the palisade (beware the peeing soldier). Continue on until you see the cook (the trickiest part), run in and rapidly begin clicking on him to fill a meter which will cast the Axii sign on him, or kill him by throwing a poisoned harpy claw. Do not try to remotely cast Axii, it will not work and will alert the guards, you must run up to him and fill the meter. Continue along the palisade to the right and continue to the 2nd entrance, where another 5 soldiers may be encountered. Go through this door, then walk down to the shore and into the cave, avoiding the soldier to the right.
In either case the cave is the same - a few Rotfiends and a Bullvore along the way. You should also kill the golem at the end of the cave. He is on the right side across a small gap which separates his area from the main part of the cave. Jump over it to fight him. Beware, the golem is not to be underestimated; the room holds some nice loot.
After exiting the cave you will be brought into a tent and after a short flashback and some news about Triss, sentenced to death. Vernon Roche and Ves will come to your aid at the last possible moment. Fight the remaining forces by firstly focusing on the mage, Vanhemar. He will protect himself by repeatedly casting Quen and teleporting away, but is also able to use the other signs as well.
Once all enemies are defeated there will be 2 possibilities what happen next, depending on your choices in Royal Blood:
Return to Philippa and pass through the mist with her again (you know the drill). Back in Vergen, talk to Philippa in her house. She will tell you that Cynthia escaped, but left the rose of remembrance behind. Philippa can now cast the spell to resurrect the sleeping beauty. (XP 2250 - the story continues with Vergen Besieged)
Chapter III ("Iorveth's Path").
After successfully defending Vergen and following Philippa and Saskia (along with Iorweth), you will see a cutscene of Triss being decompressed from her figurine prison and returned to human form.
This quest is generally completed, except if you decide to leave Philippa in the dungeons and search for Triss at the end of the quest For a Higher Cause!.
Walk down the stairs with the ambassador as a hostage and turn left on the first crossing at the bottom. Some guards will see you and back away while shouting at you. Follow them through the door up the stairs and out to a yard. The commander of the Nilfgardian soldiers will then shoot the ambassador then send the entire camp of soldiers after you. Dodge around, you have a lot of space to fight and your adrenalin should soon be filled up so you can lighten up their ranks.
Ensure you don't kill Renauld with igni, or a bug will stop you from releasing Triss afterward.
Walk to the ladder and follow the path into the other yard. Here are even more soldiers as well as a mage and the commander himself. Kill them all and take the commanders key to free Triss out of her prison in the dungeon nearby. Talk to her and take her with you, which will conclude this quest (XP 2500).
You will unlock A Summit of Mages.
Journal entry.
Chapter I
If Geralt does not give Iorveth his sword during the quest "The Assassins of Kings":
 "Triss was in danger. The kingslayer wanted to grab her and force her to open a portal to Aedirn. Geralt rushed full pelt to Flotsam - every second was precious. A single heartbeat could decide the sorceress' life or death."
 "Loredo consecrated the victory over the Scoia'tael by announcing a great celebration. There were barrels of beer and free sausage – what more would the people of a shithole town need to love their new heroes? Geralt was in no mood to celebrate, however. He ran for the inn where I awaited. Only I knew what was happening with Triss."
If Geralt gives Iorveth his sword during the quest "The Assassins of Kings":
 "Triss was in danger. The kingslayer wanted to force her to open a portal to Aedirn. Geralt ran to Flotsam as fast as he could - there was no time to lose. A single heartbeat could decide whether the sorceress lived or died."
 "And what of Flotsam? Iorveth had won and his victory wrought bloody revenge upon the people of Flotsam. They, in turn, avenged themselves on the nonhumans living in the trading post. It was a pogrom that would echo through Temeria for years to come. Thatched roofs set alight, the street were piled with corpses and smashed barricades. Geralt ran through blood and flame to the inn, to find me waiting there. Only I knew what was happening with Triss."
 "Somewhat surprised by Geralt's haste and preoccupied with the events occurring at the trading post, I answered the witcher's stern question with surprise, telling him that Triss had gone to see Síle. Then I looked at the witcher's face and understood that this was no joke. I joined him for moral support."
 "And Síle's room? It looked like the devil had danced there. My trained eye immediately recognized that a fight happened. Feverish, we searched for any clues to tell us what had happened to Triss."
 "The Good Book says he who seeks shall find. In the wall separating the sorceress' room from the neighboring den of pleasure, we found a hole with at least one purpose. Someone could peek through it and see what was happening in Síle's room! Never had the witcher run so fast to a brothel."
 "Today I know what happened in that room, but back then we had a difficult riddle to solve. At the brothel we were told that Triss had entered the room with the elf Cedric and spoken with someone through a magical device called a megascope. We learned that our sole witness had fled through the trading post's gate, wounded. Because of the darkness, ordinary people would have had to wait until morning to search, but for a witcher with a Cat potion at his disposal, no night is too dark. Without wasting a moment, Geralt left to search for Cedric, following a trail of blood."
 "Unfortunately it was too late for the elf. Before he died, he managed to explain that he tried to fight the kingslayer in Síle's room. Letho had forced Triss to open a portal through which the tormentor and his victim departed for the town of Vergen in Aedirn. I had a feeling Triss was dead, but the witcher had to find her, of course, or at least her body."
Chapter II
Roche's path:
 "The witcher didn't find any traces of Triss Merigold in Vergen, but Fate smiled upon our hero as he was exiting the ghastly mist. Geralt ran into Roche and his men, who were searching Nilfgaardian bodies. It turned out that the Emperor's troops attacked the Blue Stripes, a deed strange in itself and most likely resulting from nervous tension. But Vernon saved the most interesting bit for the end: he saw a miniature figurine bearing an uncanny resemblance to Triss Merigold in the Black Ones' hands. The witcher, of course, heard of artifact compression - a spell allowing to polymorph a living being into an inanimate item. Without wasting time, he followed the Nilfgaardian survivors to their camp, hoping he will find the sorceress there."
 "Geralt reached the Nilfgaardian camp, but he was too late. He could only watch as the Nilfgaardian vessel sailed away. The camp was deserted and bereft of any clues as to whether the Black Ones had indeed kidnapped Triss or not. The witcher had no way to follow the escapees up river, so the trail went cold. The witcher clenched his fists and decided to finish what he had to finish, and then venture off in pursuit of the Nilfgaardians."
Iorveth's path:
 "Further reading will tell you that Geralt accomplished a lot in Aedirn. He fought wars, killed monsters, obstructed kings and caused unhealthy arousal in sorceresses. You have to keep in mind, however, that his priority was finding Triss. Sorceresses, as all other women do, keep in packs. Thus, in his search, Geralt headed for Philippa Eilhart's house. Unhealthy arousal, however, was out of the question in that case."
If Geralt talks to Philippa Eilhart about Triss:
 "It turned out that someone in Vergen might have encountered Triss. A dwarf had seen a redheaded woman fall from the sky. The witcher decided this had not been the passenger of an unruly broom, and assumed instead that it had been Triss falling out of a portal. He immediately went to see that dwarf."
 If Geralt hears Mantas Birut's story:
 "Someone who falls from the sky is likely, in a general sense, to have numerous misadventures and get in trouble at the drop of hat. The dwarf told the witcher that after dropping from the heavens, the woman had been kidnapped by a troll from the forested ravines. It seems only knights get to deal with dragons and damsels in distress. The witcher had to content himself with a troll and a sorceress."
If Geralt agrees to help the he-troll:
 "It was one of those gloomy trolls that neither build bridges nor harass sheep and shepherds, but sit on a stone, brooding until they turn into rock themselves. Geralt only managed to learn that the troll indeed found a woman who fell from the sky, but only a piece of cloth remained. The garment was in the hands of the troll's wife, however she had left her husband. To recover the sorceress' clothing, Geralt had to bring the female troll back. What choice did he have?"
If Geralt agrees to help the he-troll without hearing Mantas Birut's story:
 "In Aedirn, Geralt continued his intrepid search for Triss Merigold. Near the town of Vergen, he chanced upon a troll who had met the sorceress. It was one of those gloomy trolls that neither build bridges nor harass sheep and shepherds, but sit on boulders, brooding until they turn to stone. The troll had indeed found a woman who had fallen from the sky, but only her bandana remained. The garment, however, had been stolen by the troll's wife just before she had left her mate. To recover the sorceress' bandana, Geralt had to bring the she-troll home. What choice did he have?"
If Geralt fights the he-troll:
 "Even a brooding troll can be a dangerous troll, a fact Geralt learned the hard way when he infuriated the monster. His intentions were good, but as usual, things got out of hand. The witcher was once again saved by the training he had received at Kaer Morhen. When the troll fell, Geralt could look for its better half, and for Triss' bandana."
If Geralt helps Adam Pangratt fight the she-troll:
 "Having found his way to the she-troll's lair, Geralt was surprised to encounter humans there. They were mercenaries commanded by one Adam Pangratt, a soldier of fortune who had made a name for himself at Brenna. The soldiers and she-troll were at each other's throats. As a witcher should, Geralt decided to help the mercenaries defeat the beast."
 "As it turned out, the witcher was not the sole human in the area to be interested in trolls. A group of Adam Pangratt's mercenaries was hunting the brooding troll's wife. Facing a conflict of interest, Geralt stood with the humans, as a witcher should. The female troll fell, and our hero took Triss' bandana from the beast's still warm body."
If Geralt helps the she-troll fight Adam Pangratt:
 "Having found his way to the she-troll's lair, Geralt was surprised to encounter humans there. They were mercenaries commanded by one Adam Pangratt, a soldier of fortune who had made a name for himself at Brenna. The soldiers and she-troll were at each other's throats. Always sensitive to injustice, even that perpetrated on beasts, Geralt decided to help the she-troll drive off her assailants."
If Geralt did not fight the he-troll:
 "All happy families are alike. Including trollish families. Thanks to Geralt the couple was together again, and the trollish woman rewarded our hero with Triss' scarf for all his efforts."
 "As it turned out, the witcher was not the sole human in the area to be interested in trolls. A group of Adam Pangratt's mercenaries was hunting the brooding troll's wife. Facing a conflict of interest, Geralt stood with the female troll, whom he was supposed to bring back to her mate. Furious, the soldiers of fortune attacked the witcher, and our hero had to defend both himself and the beast. We could debate whether he did the right thing. As it was, he forced Pangratt to yield and could reunite the she-troll and he-troll."
 "Geralt turned out to be smarter than some of his deeds would suggest. He may have not found Triss, but he certainly knew a crafty sorceress could locate a missing person using said person's clothes. And Philippa Eilhart was, beyond all doubt, a crafty sorceress."
 "The witcher gave the scarf to Philippa, but the search for Triss had to wait. Friendship is all fine and dandy, but politics was always more important to Philippa. At that time, the Redanian sorceress put all her effort into the attempts to cure Saskia, and no-one could blame her for that."
 "Following the confusion with Prince Stennis, Geralt was forced to seek Philippa's advice. The sorceress had more time for him and helped the witcher with a very important matter..."
 "I am forced to admit that once Philippa rolled up her sleeves and finally got to work, the results proved miraculous. Using her megascope, she ascertained that Triss was in an area shielded from divination magic, that is, either on the cursed battlefield or on the other side of it. The reader may ask if this was the limit of what this mistress of magic could do under the circumstances. But the learned among you know that cursed places are naturally saturated with chaotic energy and immune to penetration. Philippa gave Geralt an amulet that would lead him safely through the spectral mist, so the witcher resumed his search for Triss without further ado."
 "The path through the mist was a path through a battle, through a clash of two wraith armies born of soldiers who had died in a struggle between Kaedwen and Aedirn many years ago. Death and chaos ruled that cursed soil, and Geralt was an intruder. But he was also a witcher, so he managed to get to the other side. To say he did so unscathed would be to say that the elves had benefited from human colonization. Vernon Roche awaited Geralt on the other side of the deathly cloud, and believe me, the witcher would rather have crossed the mist back and again than talked to Roche. Yet despite their differences, they shared a goal - both wished to find Triss. Vernon claimed the sorceress could be in Henselt's camp, among the Nilfgaardians. Geralt could not enter through the front gate. He had a choice: to use an eastern entrance, by the river, along the cliffs, or to ask the camp followers about another way in."
 If Geralt enters the cave under the Kaedweni camp through the old tower's cellar:
 "Once more the madame proved priceless as a source of information. Sometimes I think that if prostitutes were placed in charge of training witchers at Kaer Morhen, more of the boys would survive that ordeal and they would emerge into the world armed with all sorts of additional knowledge - and not just the kind you thought of first. But I digress. The witcher found the cave entrance, boldly strode inside, and began looking for the tunnel that would lead him straight to Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen's camp."
If Geralt enters the cave under the Kaedweni camp by going through the camp:
 "Our hero decided to make for the tunnel leading to the Nilfgaardians by going straight through Henselt's camp. Obviously, he couldn't simply walk between the soldiers' tents. He crept through the shadows, looking for cover behind tent walls, and gave a wide berth to the guards. He tried to be as silent as snowflakes falling onto drifts."
 "The western part of the camp really contained an entrance to a cave that lead Geralt to the Nilfgaardian camp."
 If Geralt needs to get Henselt's blood for the "Royal Blood" quest:
 "The witcher managed to enter the Kaedweni camp, and since he was already there he decided to sneak into Henselt's tent and get the royal blood he needed to cure Saskia. A plan worthy of a vampire, but Geralt was no bloodsucker (though he killed many). Our hero decided he needed the services of an ace spy and asked Vernon Roche for help."
 If Geralt used Stennis' blood for the "Royal Blood" quest:
 "Entering the Kaedweni camp was much easier than leaving it. Therefore Geralt asked Vernon Roche, who had already proven his ability to extract the witcher from hostile territory in the dungeons of Castle La Valette, for help."
 "Keeping their multinational Empire in check required much craftiness from the Black Ones, and Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen was known as one of the craftiest Nilfgaardians for a reason. While looking for Triss, Geralt fell into a trap the emissary set. But that was only the beginning. Geralt spat all elixirs out when he learned that he found a compressed Triss some time ago, and carried her, in the form of a figurine, on his person through the whole time. The sorceress-turned-item changed hands, and Fitz-Oesterlen took her to Loc Muinne. Geralt was furious, and Philippa Eilhart was now in deep trouble."
 "Who had cast the artifact compression spell and turned Triss into a figurine? Philippa denied all charges, claiming it had been the work of her lover, Cynthia. The witcher was willing to believe her, for Philippa was not one who would readily admit to an error, yet it was obvious that her lover, on Nilfgaard's payroll, had made a dolt of her. The Empire thus gained a powerful enemy, and Geralt gained an ally."
 "Small comfort though it was, Geralt spotted the rose of remembrance he gave to Triss among the sundries Cynthia had left behind. Now he could use the flower's petals as an ingredient for Saskia's cure."
Chapter III
 "Geralt reached the ancient elven city of Loc Muinne. Ages earlier the sorcerer Geoffrey Monck had brought a group of human children gifted with spontaneous magical abilities here for training. Taught by elven Wise, the Sources became legendary sorcerers who aided the human pioneers. When humans had finally settled the continent, they repaid their debt of gratitude by destroying Loc Muinne and slaughtering its inhabitants. The scenic city ruins now ironically played host to a summit of sorcerers. The Nilfgaardian delegation was also taking part, and the Black Ones had brought the kidnapped Triss Merigold with them. Pondering the fickleness of history, Geralt searched for any trace of the sorceress. Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen was the key to her freedom."
 If Geralt chooses to rescue Triss:
 "Geralt took Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen prisoner, and with a hostage like that, he hoped to force the Nilfgaardians to free Triss Merigold. The witcher and his captive headed towards the Nilfgaardian camp."
 "Renuald aep Matsen, commander of the Nilfgaardian knights, showed Geralt what he thought about his "trump card" - he simply killed Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. A sad end, for what else do we call the death of a man reputed to be the most cunning diplomat of his time by the hand of his countryman? The witcher, however, had little time to reflect on the downfalls of great figures. Surrounded by the Black Ones, he fought for his life and for Triss' freedom."
 "And he won both. Displaying presence of mind, he searched Aep Matsen's body and found a key. The sorceress was free - finally!"
 "However, there was not time for embraces, explanations and thanks. Brave as ever, Triss helped Geralt gather his wits and they retreated from the enemy camp with utmost speed."
 If Geralt chooses not to rescue Triss:
 "Here, I must reproach our hero. Geralt had been intent on freeing Triss and tracked her with immense effort, but in the end he failed in this task. In truth, the sorceress' kidnapper had freed her in his stead. You should know that Letho, though capable at times of mindless cruelty and often undiscriminating in the means he employed, had no personal quarrel with Merigold. He had abducted her when he needed to, but as the tale of the assassins of kings came to a close, he decided he could afford to be generous and freed the sorceress from the Black Ones. Thus, blinded by his obsession of catching Letho, the witcher met Triss somwhat"[]" by chance, safe and unharmed. He immediately told her to stand aside, for at that moment he was interested in only one person – the kingslayer."

Indecent Proposal is a quest in Chapter I of "".
Walkthrough.
The side quest begins when Flotsam's Commandant Bernard Loredo invites the witcher to come see him at his residence (he specifies evening-time, and the witcher will not be able to pass the front gate (a) at any other time of day, including during Fight Club; (b) without giving up his weapons (which he may collect from a chest behind the guard after leaving the residence). Vernon Roche joins the witcher just before entering, spots a ballista just after they enter Loredo's front yard, which triggers The Ballista. If Geralt hasn't yet killed the kayran, a merchant interrupts a discussion of what to do next, and mentions that there is a component for a trap hidden in the rear compound.
Roche distracts the nearest guard to give Geralt the chance to sneak behind Loredo's residence. The witcher then finds a second guard patrolling back and forth, easily sneaks by him by going around the other side of the boulder to the right of the guard. He can also sneak up behind the guard and knock him out to make the return trip a bit easier.
Around a corner of the main building a third guard watches the door to the garden. This guard will take a piss at some point, giving a perfect opportunity to either knock him out or climb an overhanging ledge. Even if the guard is knocked out, 
Note: Be careful of the bucket next to the wall around the corner. If you go too quickly, you will tip it over and alert the guards. Avoid the bucket and knock out the guard when his back is turned.
After having dealt with the third guard, Geralt finds the door he was guarding locked, so must climb up to his right to circumvent the wall.
Once inside, and after a bit of sneaking around, Geralt spots Síle standing by a window. Taking note of the walking patterns of the guards in the area, Geralt then proceeds to either avoid them as he makes his way around, or knock them out making it a bit easier to get around unnoticed. There are more buckets to avoid (though if all guards are knocked out these become irrelevant, they are still 'detected' by the witcher medallion). Climbing the ladder nearest the previously mentioned window puts Geralt in range to eavesdrop on Sile's conversation with Loredo. This doesn't reveal much, but it becomes clear that Sile has made Loredo an offer, and that he has not yet decided about it. The sorceress expresses her contempt for Loredo's methods of government; each of them speaks grimly of the other's 'inevitable' fate at the hands of the masses they both treat with disdain in their own ways.
Return to Roche and report - this may be thorough or edited, but in either case the pair soon discovers that Loredo wishes to speak with Geralt alone. Roche bristles, but the witcher talks him down and proceeds inside. Guards block access to the first and third floors; a discussion with Loredo begins as soon as his desk is approached.
The commandant means to persuade the witcher to capture Iorveth. Geralt may ask the occasional question (such as why Lordeo doesn't seem to trust Roche) and either nod politely through the exchange or call Loredo out on his or his men's brutality and racism; in any case, the bottom line is whether or not the witcher flatly refuses to work with Loredo.
Regardless of whether Geralt agrees to Loredo's proposal, and despite no words having been exchanged with the third man in the room, this conversation grants a journal entry for Arnolt.
Notes.
An inner courtyard, also guarded, is accessible within the area. Geralt has a few options to enter it: he may have already found the key to the door while searching the rest of the area, and so can sneak by the guard and get into the area that way, or he can jump over the wall to get in, or he can knock out the guard and then either open the door or jump over the wall. In that area, he'll find the trap component and depending on the difficulty setting, some rare armor. After that, he can simply climb the ladder and jump down into the front courtyard of the manor.
 "When the dust at the gallows had settled, Loredo invited Geralt for a talk. Even if we ignore the fact that witchers, like troubadours and scholars, never refuse free board, it was a good occasion to feel out the commander. Geralt accepted the invitation."
 "Geralt reached the place in the company of Vernon Roche. If he had been going to a country dance, I would have considered it a poor choice. However his aim was to gain information about the kingslayer."
 "The commander turned out to be a busy man, and our heroes were rudely turned away at his door. They decided to wait downstairs and talk."
 If Geralt successfully sneaks into the rear compound:
 "When Geralt realized that Loredo's important business was with a sorceress, he nearly gasped. You should know that the witcher is extremely partial to sorceresses, and never misses an opportunity with one. And the mistresses of magical arts also afford him exceptional favor. Can you imagine the thrill he felt at the news that a sorceress was holding a clandestine meeting with the most important man in the area? Sneaking around the back of the building to eavesdrop was the only course of action! It should be added that one of the merchants invited to the party told Geralt where to get a piece of a trap for the kayran. Even then the witcher was thinking of a way to hunt down the monstrosity prowling the river, and a trap could prove very handy. Our hero only had to sneak to the back of Loredo's mansion, to a chest standing on a wooden platform by the wall."
 "Skillfully evading guards and assorted obstacles, the witcher moved through the garden to the back of the building. Once there, he overheard the commandant and the sorceress conversing. They were clearly involved in some scheme together, yet just as clearly at each other's throats. It was all well worth hearing! Our hero, silent as the days that follow a marital quarrel, returned to talk to Vernon Roche."
 "Richer for having overheard this and that, Geralt found Vernon Roche, and the two went to see Loredo, this time using the front door."
 If Geralt accepts Loredo's offer:
 "Loredo made the witcher an offer. Geralt was to capture Iorveth and thus repay the dept he had incurred on the scaffold. I need not explain the difficulty of this task. Suffice it to say, an entire military garrison had been unable to complete it. In spite of very poor odds, the witcher accepted the job."
 "Thus the witcher left the commandant's mansion as a friend. Loredo was certain he had found the perfect tool with which to carry out his less than honorable plan, but time would prove just how wrong he was..."
 If Geralt declines Loredo's offer:
 "Loredo made the witcher an offer. Geralt was to capture Iorveth and thus repay the dept he had incurred on the scaffold. I need not explain the difficulty of this task. Suffice it to say, an entire military garrison had been unable to complete it. Geralt, however, mindful of the witchers' code, declined."
 "When the witcher declined, Loredo grew outright irate. Leaving the commandant's house, Geralt suspected he might have made a new enemy. Time would prove him right."

The Rose of Remembrance is a quest in Chapter I of "".
Walkthrough.
("Needs Completing) "
After questioning Ciaran in the barge, Triss mentions that the roses Ciaran spoke of could help restore Geralt's memory. Geralt is given the choice of searching for the roses alone, or letting Triss come with him. Bringing Triss with you opens more 'Romance' options as well as a chance to get an ability by rejecting the former; not bringing her merely speeds up this phase of the quest. Choosing to go with Triss also means that you start on the quest immediately, while choosing to go alone lets you do other things first.:
If you chose to go with Triss:
 "Interrogating Ciaran made Geralt feel strange. Perhaps it touched a nerve, and it certainly caused anxiety. The witcher could almost hear the memories locked away in his mind calling for freedom and battering at the door that kept them from him. Seeing the witcher's behavior, Triss decided there was no time to lose and asked Geralt to find a rose of remembrance. This powerful psychoactive agent could hasten the recovery of his memory. Geralt and Triss went off to search for the flower, or, more precisely, Geralt followed the sorceress, who knew how to reach the place where the roses apparently grew."
If you chose to go alone:
 "Interrogating Ciaran made Geralt feel strange. Perhaps it touched a nerve, and it certainly caused anxiety. The witcher could almost hear the memories locked away in his mind calling for freedom and battering at the door that kept them from him. Seeing the witcher's behavior, Triss decided there was no time to lose and asked Geralt to find a rose of remembrance. This powerful psychoactive agent could hasten the recovery of his memory. The witcher went off to find the rose alone, even though this irritated Triss somewhat. He didn't know where to look for the flower, but he was counting on luck and on Lobinden's residents, who knew the surrounding forests like the backs of their hands. He also knew that he always could go back and ask Triss for help."
If you asked Anezka for help:
 "The witcher asked Anezka about roses of remembrance. The young woman admitted that she had once had one, but not because she had picked it herself. She had received her rose from an admirer."
If you bribed Cedric for help:
 "After some haggling, Geralt succeeded in bribing Cedric. In exchange, he got a map indicating the location of the ruined elven gardens, as well as sites where certain herbs grew and areas haunted by monsters. Without a doubt, this information was well worth the coin the witcher had spent. Glancing at Cedric's directions, the witcher sett off to find the elusive rose."
If you chose to go alone and then changed your mind and asked Triss to go with you:
 "Searching alone brought little result, so the witcher went to Triss and asked to accompany her. The sorceress knew where to find the flowers, so the witcher followed."
If you went with Triss:
"The witcher reached the waterfall and then followed a path upwards, towards the elven ruins."
"Instinct told the witcher there were roses of remembrance somewhere nearby. Indeed, Geralt soon saw the plant and could pick the flower he had seen seeking."
"Out hero found a bush of roses of remembrance, leaned forward and picked what looked like an ordinary flower. "A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose," a poet once wrote, but she was wrong in regard to this one, for the flower really was the key to Geralt's memory."
 "The ruins' atmosphere contributed to an intimate feeling both Geralt and Triss felt, yet intruders disturbed it. A band of thugs stealing the last surviving statues appeared in the ruins. The outraged Triss provoked the plunderers and a flight ensued. Geralt had to defend both his life and that of the sorceress."
 "As if the bandits were not enough, the ground beneath the witcher's and the sorceress' feet caved in. The ceilings of an underground room, eroded by time, gave in and our heroes landed within. It was a beautiful bathhouse, elven-built, of course. It was still supplied in water by a clean spring! However Geralt was in no mood to admire the works of ancient masters. The witcher started looking for an exit."
 "You should know that Geralt and Triss had by now grown weary of missions ordered by crowned heads and of saving the world, whether in its entirety or in part, not to mention their exhaustion with pursuing secret organizations. When the witcher found the roses of remembrance, they had a long talk about private things which had until now been continuously put off. The sorceress wanted to leave it all and flee as far as possible, to keep a low profile with Geralt, somewhere away from all problems."
 If the Witcher refuses Triss's offer:
 "The witcher, however, wanted to get Foltest's killer at all costs and didn't agree to the sorceress' proposal. The offended sorceress left"[]", while Geralt began pursuit of the kingslayer."
 If the Witcher agrees with Triss:
 "The Witcher, however, wanted to repay his debt of gratitude to Roche, and went to speak to him."

In Cervisia Veritas is a quest in Chapter 2 of "". It is only available on Vernon Roche's path.
This quest, along with The Butcher of Cidaris and Lost Lambs, is one of three ways to acquire a square coin needed to advance Conspiracy Theory.
Walkthrough.
In the Kaedwenian camp are three drunk soldiers calling out for a friend of theirs, Odrin. Walk out the Western camp exit to find Odrin passed out along the lake shore, mumbling about a square coin. You have to lead Odrin back into the camp, and bribe the camp guard (30 orens)to get him in or claim Odrin is your captive and he is drunk so you could interrogate him.
Once in the camp, go round up Odrin's friends (see below). In the camp canteen, you must select the correct conversation options or Odrin and his friends will accuse you of spying and refuse to talk.
The friends show up as green dots on the minimap - unless you've already spoken to them in which case there are no map markers. However all three are within 30ft of each other in the central 'junction' of paths near the main entrance to the camp. Just walk near them for them to start following you.
Ask 'Think Henselt might have a job for me?' and then say 'The king knows what he is doing' to complete the quest. Most other choices will result in a failed quest. Upon completion of this quest, Odrin gives you a square coin and reveals information on Conspiracy Theory.
 "Several soldiers, all drunk like lords, were searching for their lost drinking buddy. Geralt decided to help them, for he had hoped that the grateful soldiers will turn into a mine of information about the conspiracy against Henselt."
 "The search was not difficult. Odrin, also drunk like a lord, was lying face in the mud. The witcher then started to lead him back to his friends, to reunite the merry company in the camp canteen."
If Geralt doesn't have enough coin to pay the bribe:
 "A guard accosted Geralt and Odrin at the gate, demanding a bribe. Unfortunately, Geralt's pockets were empty, so he left Odrin at the gate and wandered off in search of coin."
Once Geralt pays the bribe:
 "Geralt paid the guard at the gate and led Odrin, drunk as a lord, into the camp."
 "Geralt found all three of Odrin's friends - a task most difficult to complete with a shnockered soldier in tow. As you may surmise, keeping the unruly herd in check wasn't easy, either."
 "Al's [] well that ends well. Geralt brought the whole drunk and singing company to the canteen. There he continued his plan, so loosened the soldiers' tongues with beer and tried to get information about the conspiracy out of them."
If Geralt doesn't have enough coin to pay for the round of drinks:
 "Geralt managed to lead the entire company to the canteen, but, when he proposed buying them a round, he realized he didn't have any coin on him. Odrin promised to wait for him to return with money. After all, a witcher buying a round of drinks is not something you see every day."
If Geralt succeeds:
 "There's much truth in the proverb saying there is truth to be found in wine. Geralt got Odrin and his companions completely drunk, gained their trust, and as a result they told him how to find the conspirators. He also received a pass to the schemers' hideout - a square coin."
If Geralt fails:
 "However it turned out that neither the witcher is crafty enough nor the soldiers drunk enough. When the warriors realized that Geralt is pumping them for information, they signaled he's no longer an acceptable drinking companion. The witcher ran through the camp all to [] many times only to learn nothing."
Notes.
If you go through the arc in Conspiracy Theory and talk to Dethmold, then this quest will automatically fail.

Malena is a secondary character in "".
Like many non-humans in Flotsam, she works as a servant for humans. Geralt meets her when she is being harassed by Loredo's men, accusing her of being a Scoia'tael and responsible for the murder of their companions. If Geralt decides to interfere in the conversation and listen to Malena, she brings them to the entrance of a cave west of the pier, asking the witcher to find the corpses and some evidence on them. After exploring the cave it is revealed that Scoia'tael did indeed murder the soldiers. Malena's fate is in Geralt's hands and it is up to the player to decide what to do.
 "Life was not easy for the nonhumans of Flotsam, and Malena was no exception. The elven woman was suspected of leading soldiers into Scoia'tael ambushes, a charge that could easily send her to the scaffold."
If Geralt decides to not interfere when Loredo's men accuse Malena:
"The witcher decided not to interfere. Malena was arrested and charged with being an accessory to murder. Her fate was easy to predict."
If Geralt decides to defend Malena against Loredo's men:
"The elven woman had indeed been luring soldiers into a trap. Her fate was now in Geralt's hands."
If Geralt decides to tell the truth about the corpses in the cave:
"Malena was arrested and charged with being an accessory to murder. She suffered the consequences of her deeds."
If Geralt decides to lie to Loredo's men, saving the girl:
"Though the witcher did not reveal her complicity in the murders, the elven woman could not trust him. This led her to repay him with betrayal. Yet even then the witcher did not stoop so low as to kill an unarmed woman, and simply drove Malena away."
If Geralt decides to lie to Loredo's men and then kills the girl:
"Though the witcher did not reveal her complicity in the murders, the elven woman could not trust him. This led her to repay him with betrayal. For this Malena paid the ultimate price."
If Geralt decides to lie to Loredo's men, but then brings her to Loredo: 
"Geralt found the elven woman in the hospital ruins. The girl was trembling with fear, yet the witcher was merciless and took her to Loredo's soldiers. I am not sure if we can speak of justice, but she was certainly punished for her deeds."

Malena (quest)

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
Malena is a quest from Chapter I in "".
Walkthrough.
After starting the quest in Lobinden, the guards and Malena relocate to a cave outside Flotsam (near where you first enter Flotsam while running away from the Scoia'tael). You go into the cave (which is populated by many Nekkers. This fight can be difficult because there are many Nekkers and Geralt may be at a low level and will quickly be swarmed and killed. Use a few bombs to damage the Nekkers as they run toward you), and proceed toward the eastern end to find the bodies of two dead guards, full of arrows. Past the bodies are two ladders leading up to a locked trapdoor which can be used to enter the grounds of Loredo's residence during "Death to the Traitor!". After returning to the guards, either accuse Malena of being a Scoia'tael agent (she hangs and the quest ends), or listen to her, follow, and be promptly betrayed, ambushed by Scoia'tael. Use hit-and-run tactics to avoid being surrounded - the elves move almost as fast as Geralt.
During the fight Malena flees; she can be found outside the hospital ruins, hiding in a corner near the entrance. She may be killed, handed over to Loredo, or allowed to escape one more time.
 "Geralt was wandering around Lobinden when he noticed several guards harassing an elven woman - Malena. The guards seemed to be hurling grave accusations at her. Ever sensitive to displays of intolerance, the witcher decided to investigate."
 "The elf stood accused of spying for the Scoia'tael and leading guards into an ambush. It was a grave accusation and if she turned out to be guilty, she would be executed. Geralt decided to look into the case. He headed for the cave where the missing guards had gone. He wanted to find out more about their fate."
"Geralt noticed bloody traces at the cave's entrance. He eased his sword in its sheath and entered the cavern."
"Elf-made arrows were lodged in the soldiers' bodies. Therefore the accusations against Malena were true-the soldiers had been killed by the Squirrels and their bodies fed to the monsters. Geralt went outside, where the elven woman awaited under guard."
 If Geralt chooses lie to the guards about the soldiers' fate:
"Geralt decided to keep the truth to himself. He did not mention the elven arrows, blaming the guards' deaths on monsters. The soldiers left, their faces sour, and Malena thanked the witcher, proposing to meet him by the waterfall, near the elven ruins."
"Geralt had high hopes for the rendezvous, and was taken by surprise by the Scoia'tael that attacked him from cover. Malena fled and the witcher fought desperately for his life."
"The witcher escaped with his life. Leaving the ambush site, he wondered where to look for Malena. He had a few things to tell her."
 If Geralt decides to kill Malena:
 "Geralt found the elven woman in the hospital ruins. The girl was trembling with fear, yet the witcher was merciless. For killing the soldiers and attempting to murder him, he exacted a capital punishment."
 If Geralt decides to spare Malena:
 "The elven girl tried to find refuge in the ruined hospital, but she was captured. She was trembling with fear, yet our hero let her go. He forbade Malena from returning to Flotsam, however, and she never did."
 If Geralt decides to bring Malena to Loredo:
 "Geralt found the elven woman in the hospital ruins. The girl was trembling with fear, yet the witcher was merciless and took her to Loredo's soldiers. I am not sure if we can speak of justice, but she was certainly punished for her misdeeds."
 If Geralt is honest with the guards, but lets Malena defend her actions:
"Geralt revealed his findings and hid nothing. Malena tried to explain herself. She asked Geralt and the soldiers to follow her and see the proof of her innocence."
"The group was ambushed by Scoia'tael by the cliffs. The witcher and the soldiers had to fight for their lives."
"Geralt saved the lives of many soldiers by drawing the attackers' attention to himself. The elves were repelled and the commander was grateful, as they managed to capture the murderess. Geralt received a reward for his efforts. Malena, in turn, was arrested, and though I know not her fate I suspect the worst, for I doubt Loredo would treat crimes against his subordinates lightly."
 If Geralt decides that Malena is guilty:
"Geralt revealed his findings and hid nothing. Malena tried to explain herself, but the warriors were implacable – they took her to the jail to interrogate her. From that moment, the soldier disappearances ceased."

The Scent of Incense

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The Scent of Incense is a secondary and optional quest in Chapter I of "".
Walkthrough.
Geralt receives this quest when he meets Vencel Pugg down by the docks in Flotsam. The scholar wishes to obtain a certain formula for some incense being sold by a local shopkeeper. Geralt agrees to get the recipe for him and heads off to find the incense shop. On the way to the shop, Geralt encounters some angry townsfolk who want the incense shop shut down, thus spawning a secondary quest "Little Shop of Dreams".
Once at the shop, Geralt can either convince the shopkeeper to give him the real formula, or accept a close substitute.
He then returns with a formula, either real or fake, to the scholar who tells the witcher that he wants to test it in his laboratory, to see if it is valid. At this point, Geralt can either agree or take back the recipe. If Geralt doesn't give the alchemist a recipe, the alchemist leaves making ominous threats, ambushing Geralt later on in the forest. The quest will later be marked as failed once Chapter II starts. Furthermore, the secret lab will not be accessible any more.
If Geralt agrees, the alchemist arranges to meet the witcher outside the gate near the market square. Once they meet up, the scholar insists on blindfolding the witcher to preserve the secrecy of the laboratory's location. If Geralt agrees to be blindfolded, he is led to the lab and then ambushed by Pugg's henchmen. If he does not agree to be blindfolded, the scholar relents and marks the lab's location on Geralt's map and waits for the witcher there.
If the formula was fake, Pugg orders his men to attack Geralt and the witcher kills the guards and the scholar as he had connections with Bleinheim, a member of the Salamandra organization in Vizima.
If the formula was real, then the alchemist offers him the reward from him thus completing the quest and Geralt can leave things at that, or Geralt can bring up the fact that he recalls exactly what Bleinheim did in Vizima and kill Pugg and the guards (There appears to be a bug in this part of the quest. For unknown reasons Geralt is not given the option to kill Pugg and the guards if he has given him the real formula and was *not* blindfolded. However, one can still choose to kill Pugg and the guards in this situation simply by drawing your weapon at that point. The guards will attack and all, including Pugg, can be slain).
Finally, if Geralt did kill Pugg and the guards, either by offered game option or by drawing his sword in the secret lab, he has two options to leave the laboratory: by the cave entrance, or by boat. If he chooses to leave by boat, he will be able to use that same boat later to go back to the lab if he wishes. If he leaves by the main entrance, the option to use the boat is lost permanently, although he can still return to the lab through the cave entrance.
Note.
Under the right conditions, this cave will never actually appear to you. If you were blindfolded on the way in and out of the cave, and having never fought the thugs, the cave will not be accessible once the quest is complete. There will simply be a rock wall where the entrance is/was located.
 "Do you like the scent of incense? Then Listen. Geralt met a scholar at the harbor. The man claimed that one of the local shopkeepers sold incense producing poisonous smoke. He could not prove the murderous trade without producing a recipe for the incense. Geralt promised to get the man a recipe for a tidy sum of orens."
 If Geralt gets the real recipe:
 "Did you think getting the recipe was difficult? Not at all. Geralt brought the information to the scholar at the harbor."
 If Geralt gets the fake recipe:
 "Geralt got a recipe, of course. It was for an incense with very similar composition, and the witcher thought the scholar would not see the difference."
 If Geralt does not give the alchemist a recipe:
"Geralt found the recipe, but on his way to the scholar he changed his mind and did not give it to him in the end. The learned man did not take the refusal well. A menacing 'we will meet again' echoed in the witcher's ears as he walked away."
If Geralt meets the alchemist and his henchmen later in the forest after refusing to provide him the recipe:
"And meet they did. The scholar tried to recover the recipe by means completely at odds with proper research methodology. A good scholar takes nothing at face value. After the witcher gave him the incense recipe the scholar from the harbor wanted to test its authenticity in his laboratory and agreed to meet the witcher on the market side of the gate. The witcher killed him in self defense and wondered who his opponenent had really been."
If Geralt does not agree to be blindfolded:
"Geralt laughed at the notion of covering his eyes. He demanded to know the location of the laboratory and brought the recipe there."
If Geralt agrees to be blindfolded:
"The witcher agreed to have his eyes covered and was led to his employer's hideout. Thus he walked straight into a trap. Yet it was a trap set by amateurs, and Geralt was a professional."
If Geralt kills the alchemist and his henchmen:
"Geralt dealt with his employer and the others. Science was unharmed, however, because they all turned out to be fisstech dealers and the remnants of Salamandra, an organisation which had crossed the witcher long ago."
If Geralt leaves without killing the alchemist and his henchmen:
"The scholar was not whom he claimed to be, but it made no difference to the witcher. He knew he gave the man a recipe for fisstech, caring only about his reward. He left content."

The Ballista is a quest in "".
This quest is given to you by Vernon Roche upon entering the front yard of Loredo's residence, during the main quest line of Chapter I. Your objective is to disable the ballista.
Walkthrough.
Talk to the prostitute nearby, you can ask her to "surprise your friend". In order for her to accept your request, you can either pay her for the job or defeat two men nearby, Myron and Alphonse, at arm wrestling. While she is off distracting the ballista guard, you can go to the ballista and remove a piece of it, thus completing the quest.
 "While visiting the commandant, Geralt had a chance to admire Loredo's newest acquisition. It was neither a swift steed nor a new piece for the local ruler's art collection. It was a brand new ballista, aimed straight at the harbor. As you can see, midlife crisis can assume many different forms."
 If Geralt persuades Margarita to seduce the guard, without paying:
 "Margarita, a local prostitute, offered to help. She promised to distract the guard provided that the witcher would first humiliate a couple of bullies named Myron and Alphonse. The two brutes liked to beat up the girls from the brothel, and Geralt was to teach them a lesson. The witcher, always sensitive to the plight of women, agreed to help the courtesan."
 "Geralt defeated both bruisers at arm wrestling. He proved they were not as tough as they thought. You should have seen their faces! Thus our hero had fulfilled his end of the bargain."
 "Margarita went forth to do her work. The witcher watched with admiration as the woman seduced the guard with minimal effort."
 "With the machine no longer guarded, Geralt got to work. As skillfully as an experienced saboteur, he removed a part from the triggering mechanism, thus completely disabling the ballista. The damage was hard to notice and would be even harder to repair. In any case, Loredo's new toy was now useless."

Little Shop of Dreams

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
Little Shop of Dreams is a quest in "".
Walkthrough.
This quest is available after Geralt accepts The Scent of Incense from Vencel Pugg. On his way to the shop to get the recipe, he encounters a group of villagers who are gathered in front of the local incense dealer in Flotsam Town Square.
He speaks to them and one of them, Matilda Szabo, says that the merchant is not selling incense, but a strong drug, and she asks the witcher to stop him.
If Geralt agrees, he must then go and speak with the Herbalist. During that conversation, he has the option to use Axii or intimidation to get either the real recipe or a "similar (fake) recipe".
If Geralt puts him out of business, the villagers give him his "handsome reward": 20 orens.
 "In Flotsam's town square, Geralt met some inhabitants protesting against a shopkeeper for selling dubious herbs. As you know, witchers and herbalists always meet aversion, but in this case it turned out a little different. The protester's leader Matilda Szabo, asked Geralt to make the shopkeeper close his business."
 "Our hero used his diplomatic talents again. The witcher convinced the owner of the shop to close his stinking business then returned to Matilda Szabo to be rewarded for his efforts."
 "The reward gladdened the eye and loaded the moneybag nicely. Geralt moved along to spread justice and prosperity. All right, he went off to do his job."

&lt;/infobox&gt;
With Flickering Heart is a quest in "". This quest is obtainable only by choosing to follow quest line.
Walkthrough.
You can start the quest after the council meeting in Vergen with Saskia and rest of leaders. The quest is given by an elf, Ele'yas, in front of The Cauldron, the tavern near the notice board.
Before proceeding to the catacombs buy some surgical tools from Felicia Cori in Rhundurin Square in Vergen. This quest item is necessary to gather evidence from one of the bodies in the catacombs, the fresh corpse.
After examining the body, find Dandelion at the inn to proceed. After that, proceed to the burned village at midnight to lure the succubus with a ballad. The lyrics should be the third sequence from Dandelion's poetry sketchbook:
 "If our bodies could a song compose..." (second dialogue option)
 "My heart would inquire of your hands pale and fine... If they'd grasp it gently, to hold like a rose..." (first dialogue option)
 "Or treat it as a morsel upon which to dine?" (second dialogue option)
At this point, the player is in control of Dandelion rather than the witcher. As Dandelion you can either choose to enter the succubus' lair by means of a trap door which opens or inform Geralt who takes over the investigation. After talking with the succubus, you will be able to choose to side with either the succubus or Ele'yas.
Rewards.
Either side has its advantages but you may want to side with the succubus in lesser difficulty modes. If you have played your cards right you should already have a better weapon (Kaedweni black sword) and a Robust red meteorite sword. The Kayran's chest piece could be considered better than Thyssen's armor but the sword may still be considerable.
High difficulty players (Dark / Insane) will have long had access to better equipment and could likely use the extra orens from siding with Ele'yas and looting the succubus.
 "And now let me tell you how I solved a crime in Vergen with a bit of help from Geralt, who started the whole thing by talking to the elf Ele'yas. Ele'yas thought he would need a witcher, but had no idea that a poet would prove to be key to the case! Young men, both elves and humans, were being murdered in Vergen. The elf said their bodies were being found near a burned village located at the mouth of the gully leading to Vergen, and subsequently being interred in catacombs beyond the town. Geralt took it all in and began to wonder if he should go to the crime scene or the burial site."
 "As Geralt searched the burned village for clues, he could not help but notice a pervading scent of sulfur, a scent so characteristic and strong that it obscures all others, as I'm sure you know. Odors at the site of a fire are nothing unusual, but the added scent of sulfur can mean only one thing to a witcher – that a succubus is or was near. Finding no other traces of the beast, however, Geralt noted his suspicion and set off for the dwarven catacombs to pursue his other lead."
 "The witcher examined the bodies of the victims and, based on his professional knowledge, concluded that the a [] succubus had killed the men. Also, Geralt found a book, a tome of my poetry, on one of the corpses. Whosoever doubted that humans and beasts alike admire my oeuvre and love me, should doubt no more, as this was proof positive of my fame. In any case, the witcher had hit a dead end and came to talk to me."
 "The book the witcher found had been stolen from me some time before. Needless to say, I was glad to recover it. This clue suggested that the succubus was an avid fan of poetry. Thus, I had no choice but to return to the village to lure the beast out with some moving lyrics. As many an epic romance states, and as Geralt reassured me, succubi are nocturnal creatures, so the witcher and I agreed to meet at midnight."
 If Dandelion doesn't sing the correct lyrics (the quest fails):
 "I tried to charm the succubus with sonnets to no avail, throwing my verses to the wind. The she-beast would not emerge from her den. Certain that no one could have done better in my place, I could but throw my arms up in helplessness. Thus, my career as a detective came to a premature and disappointing end."
 If Geralt decides to talk to Ele'yas after meeting the succubus:
 "The succubus literally ate out of my hand – such was the power of my poetry. With my aid, the witcher could speak with the demon. According to the beast, the murderer was the elf Ele'yas, a jealous lover, for you must know that the succubus had many lovers, all the murder victims among them. Geralt listened to her testimony and went to speak to the elf."
 "Obviously Ele'yas protested his innocence. And, to be honest, Geralt and I had no evidence to prove either his or the succubus' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The word of a monster against the word of a bandit – the decision was hard indeed."
 Siding with Ele'yas:
 "Geralt decided that the succubus – guilty or not – was too dangerous to leave alive. He proceeded to kill the beast. The case was thus closed, but the mystery was never fully unraveled. To this day we cannot be certain who was killing the young men, even though the succubus was the more likely perpetrator. Having fulfilled the contractor's wish, Geralt went to see Ele'yas about his reward."
 "Ele'yas seemed content that the succubus was dead, though it might be more accurate to say he was not unmoved. His face seemed to express an entire range of emotions, so many, in fact, that the witcher could not ascertain if the elf had detested the she-beast or now mourned her. Be that as it may, Ele'yas rewarded Geralt for his toil, and the case proved entirely profitable for the witcher. I cannot say if there were no more murders in Vergen. Fate in all its fickleness soon sent us off on other adventures, and I received no more news from Vergen."
 Siding with the succubus:
 "Geralt decided to accuse Ele'yas. He presented what little evidence we had gathered to Iorveth. The Scoia'tael leader wanted to talk to his subordinate, but Ele'yas was far away by then – he had fled. Still uncertain of the elf's guilt, the witcher went to tell the succubus everything."
 "Geralt decided that Ele'yas – guilty or not – would sooner or later kill the succubus. The witcher's discussion with the elf quickly escalated into a fight, and Geralt slew the Scoia'tael. We will never know if Ele'yas was truly the murderer, yet we think this very likely. Either way, the witcher decided he deserved some reward and went to see the succubus about it."
 "I will not describe how the succubus rewarded Geralt. I leave that to your imagination, dear reader. I will note only that the witcher seemed more satisfied than he usually was upon receiving a bulging pouch of orens. All in all, the adventure with the she-beast ended well for us. Were there no more murders in Vergen? That I do not know, for we were soon forced to leave the proud dwarven town and, alas, I received no more news from there."

Walkthrough.
During a close encounter with a dragon in the Prologue, Geralt lost his silver sword. This quest is to find a replacement in or around Flotsam.
There are several solutions:
 "A witcher stripped of his monster-fighting sword is like a dwarf without a beard. Geralt's silver blade had flown off with the dragon just after their memorable encounter on the walls of La Valette Castle, so our hero needed a new one. The best though certainly not the only way to acquire one was to have it forged by the dwarf blacksmith who had a workshop in Flotsam's nonhuman district."
 "With the silver sword in hand at last, Geralt's job became incomparably easier. Finally equipped like a witcher should be, our hero took to solving his own and other's problems with renewed energy."

&lt;/infobox&gt;The Eternal Battle is a quest in Chapter 2 of "". It occurs on both Iorveth's and Roche's paths.
Walkthrough.
Iorveth path.
This quest begins as soon as Geralt arrives into Vergen with Iorveth. During a with King Henselt and his allies, a powerful curse is awakened and a spectral mist appears, enveloping the Battlefield. Speaking with Philippa Eilhart at her house in Vergen, Geralt learns that to break the curse, he needs to collect some artifacts: a symbol of death, a symbol of hatred, a symbol of faith and a symbol of courage. He must retrieve the first two, death and hatred, while the sorceress promises to take care of the others.
Once the witcher has collected the items (the Standard and the Commander's sword), he must then go back to Philippa Eilhart and tell her that he is ready to proceed with the ritual. The sorceress tells him that the spirit of the Visitor, Vandergrift has changed and a powerful demon of war, a draug, has taken his place. Geralt must then proceed to the entrance to the Battlefield and enter the mist.
Roche's path.
The quest begins immediately after Geralt accompanies King Henselt and his entourage out of the Battlefield and the spectral mist, which has just appeared because of the awakening of a curse. Speaking with Dethmold in his tent, Geralt learns that he needs four artifacts to break the spell: a symbol of hate, a symbol of death, a symbol of the faith and a symbol of courage. He also needs to appease Sabrina Glevissig's ghost, by performing a ritual with the cooperation of the king.
Once the witcher has dealt with all his tasks, he must return to Dethmold and tell him he is ready to proceed. The sorcerer then tells him that the spirit of the Visitor has changed and that a powerful demon of war, a Draug, has taken his place. Geralt must then leave the Kaedweni camp and enter the spectral mist.
The Mist.
As soon as Geralt enters the mist, he is possessed by one of the ghosts and a battle begins. First, he relives the experience of one of the soldiers who was in the battle three years ago, under the Aedirnian banner. His task: to take the standard from the enemy. During this possession, Geralt cannot use his witcher abilities: he can only hit and parry. He faces three wraiths and a Draugir, in a fairly restrictive area. (Note: You can't save your game at this stage, but at the end of any cutscene, the game will save automatically).
 This battle can be rather annoying and difficult: try not to be hasty, especially on Hard and Dark Mode. Limit yourself to parrying all the coming blows and avoiding the Draugir's charges. Focus on one enemy at a time. You can press to lock onto a target. Kill them one by one and leave the Draugir until the end. Fortunately, they have relatively few hit points each, so it only takes a few blows for them to go down. Another way of killing the soldier wraiths is forcing them into the ring of fire that surrounds the battle area, once the soldier wraiths flail about when set on fire they will probably burn to death without further interference. Use the riposte ability against the Draugir to kill it, it can also be set on fire but is more resistant and will continue to attack regardless.
 After the fight, a second vision begins. This time your task is to bring a message to the unit commander. All you have to do is running, avoiding the flaming arrows rain. You can hear the sound of a horn announcing incoming arrows every time. So do not dawdle and run behind the barricades. Remember not to wait too long behind them, because a second round of arrows may be sufficient to burn and destroy them.
 This part can be extremely stressful because, if you get hit even once by the arrows, you die. You must be very patient and calculate well the time between the two horn blows.
In the next scene, Geralt sees Vandergrift, the commander of the opposing army "–" who has become a Draug "–" talking with Sabrina Glevissig complaining about her poor results in the battle so far and threatening to inform Henselt. The scene then switches to Sabrina consulting with the Lodge of Sorceresses about using Melgar's Fire to win the battle and destroy Vandergrift at the same time. In the next scene, Geralt is possessed by the ghost of Seltkirk. As Seltkirk, Geralt must fight the enemies he meets along the way and once again he has no witcher skills at his disposal. He can only block and hit. This time however, the fight is much easier.
 Use the counterattack (if chosen in the swordsmanship tree) against the enemies and try to block all incoming blows. At the end of the scene, finally you take the role of Geralt and face the final boss.
 If you approach the second group carefully, you might be able to lure them out one by one.
 All you have to do is avoid the charges of the Draug, the meteor shower and the whirlwind, into which the draug occasionally transforms. You cannot parry its blows in any way, they are too strong. Dodge them by pressing . When the Draug shouts "Archers!", find cover behind the rocks to avoid the flaming arrow volleys. When the Draug shouts "Trebuchets!" it means that a meteor shower is coming. In addition to the vitality bar, it also has a shield bar, that must be depleted unless you are attacking from behind. The best strategy is to cast Quen or Yrden, although the Draug has a high resistance and it may take a while to trap it. Fast attack does negligible damage against it, and attacks from the front do no damage until its shield is depleted. Instead, use the strong attack and attack from behind.
 When you finally defeat it, loot its remains, which include some crafting components to make the Draug armor. (In the enhanced edition Geralt will automatically loot the body of the Draug)
The Draug.
Once the curse is broken, Geralt witnesses a scene where Seltkirk laments the falling meteor storm. Another ghost then possesses him, a priest this time. His task: to lead some soldiers to safety, using the palisades to as shields from the incoming attacks. This task is much easier than the previous tasks.
Once the soldiers have been led to safety, Geralt witnesses another scene with Henselt sentencing Sabrina to death, for casting the fire storm on the army, causing the loss of his men. Geralt also recovers another one of his memories, this time remembering when he met Letho, while saving the latter against a beast that nearly killed him.
Roche's path:
"In the world of wraiths, only those relics the ghosts had a connection to in life have any meaning. Geralt and Dethmold agreed that they would need items symbolizing war, specifically, objects representing the concepts of hatred, courage, faith and death. The witcher thus began his search for the Dun Banner's standard, the symbol of death, for the sword that had belonged to the infamous and odious General Vandergrift, and for a piece of the armor that had once belonged to the brave Seltkirk. The symbol of faith – a medallion – was in Henselt's possession."
 "Thus the witcher acquired all the relics. He was ready to lift the curse from the battlefield, so he went to talk to Dethmold."
Iorveth's path:
 "In the world of wraiths, only those relics the ghosts had a connection to in life have any meaning. After conferring with Philippa Eilhart, Geralt ascertained that he would need items symbolizing ideas linked to war, specifically, objects representing hatred, courage, faith and death. The witcher thus embarked on a search for the Dun Banner's standard, believed to be the symbol of death, and for a sword that had belonged to the infamous commander named Vandergrift, purported to symbolize hatred. The sorceress promised to find a medallion symbolizing faith and a fragment of a suit of armor that had belonged to the brave Seltkirk."
 "And so, Geralt acquired those relics within his reach, and went to see Philippa, who promised to find the others."
 "Just as she had promised, Philippa provided the armor fragment and the medallion. She was, after all, a mistress of magic, wasn't she?"
 "Thus the witcher had acquired all the relics. Ready to lift the curse from the battlefield, he went to see Philippa."
 "Armed with artifacts and some good advice, with his heart in his mouth, Geralt set off to take part in the spectral battle. His resolve to lift the blood curse had never been stronger, for he realized that Cedric's prophecy could be taken literally - dispersing the mist could restore the witcher's memory. Within the mist, a worthy foe already awaited Geralt."
 "Now listen how Geralt achieved the impossible. How he ended the blood curse and defeated a draug, a creature that never should have set foot in this world. Witchers and poets know well that wraiths are beings trapped in an illusory reality, forever damned to repeat events from the past. Defeating them is only possible through entering that reality, the only true reality for them. And so, Geralt entered the mist as an Aedirnian soldier, thus declaring for one of the sides. He had to change the course of battle, that is defeat the Kaedweni standard bearer and capture the banner he carried."
 "So, how did Geralt lift the blood curse and defeat the terrifying leader of the wraiths? Well, he did it like a witcher would. He knew the battle was taking place in a reality born of evil magic. That reality consisted of the ghosts of the fallen, and they could be reached only by entering their world. Geralt had to change the course of battle, so he entered the mist as a Kaedweni soldier. He ran to his commander to inform him that the enemy had captured the standard, and to warn him about a possible ambush."
 "Entering the mist this time, Geralt joined in the battle between the wraiths of Aedirnian soldiers and those of Kaedweni soldiers. The witcher assumed the all important role of the heroic Seltkirk, fighting under the sign of the chevron. Our hero faced a difficult task - he had to fight his way through the battlefield and defeat the Kaedweni army's general."
 "Pushing through the battlefield, Geralt spotted a Kaedweni general. Defeating the wraith would disrupt the scenario of the eternal battle, so the witcher did not hesitate for one moment."
 "Sorceresses took part in the battle. Though regular Kaedweni forces won the advantage, the magicians began a sorcerous barrage. Fireballs decimated both sides, and Geralt could only gather his unit and lead it out of the battle, to the king's position."

Some time after his tour of the Kaedweni camp and meeting with the king, Geralt speaks with Zyvik, who tells him that two of his soldiers have gone missing.
The lost soldiers can be found at the site of Sabrina Glevissig's execution, southwest of the Kaedweni camp along the beach. They explain that the Visionary led them here and now they are afraid to leave due to the drowners nearby. After examining the items at the execution site, the guards will agree to go with you. You must escort the soldiers out of the area, protecting them from Drowners. Either of the soldiers dying will cause the quest to fail.
If you decide not to help the guards, the quest will remain in your quest log until the end of Chapter II but you will not be able to finish it.
 "As the witcher wandered the Kaedweni camp, he was approached by Zyvik, whom he already met earlier. The man, visibly concerned, asked Geralt to find some soldiers who had gone missing somewhere beyond the palisade. The soldier offered a reward for completing this task, so refusing him whould have been sinful. The witcher promised to keep an eye out for the missing grunts during his excursions in the area."
 "It turned out the soldiers had been led astray by a religious fanatic known as the Visionary. Led astray to a dangerous place at that, on thick with monsters. Geralt, as befit a witcher, decided to save the soldiers and led them to safety."
 "The witcher should have received a medal. Both soldiers reached the camp safely. I have to admit that Geralt can be useful when he wants to be. He truly earned the reward that awaited him in Zyvik's hands."
 "Seeing both soldiers returned in one piece, Zyvik was so happy he nearly embraced Geralt. He gladly gave the witcher his reward, and Geralt gladly accepted."

Conspiracy Theory is a quest in "". It runs in parallel with the quest Courage Symbolized.
Walkthrough.
"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
Leave the camp and go to the southwest where the red tents are. Talk to Madame Carole, ask for a prostitute, and give her a square coin (obtained upon completion of the quest The Butcher of Cidaris or In Cervisia Veritas, or by examining the items around the circle at the site of Sabrina Glevissig's execution during Lost Lambs). Ask specifically for Whistling Wendy. When Whistling Wendy asks what you would like, choose "open the gates of paradise with her smile."
Whistling Wendy will walk to her room and open a trap door. Jump down and get ready for a fight. Traut will have a short conversation with you, but you will enter battle with him and few of his allies. Kill them all and take everything - among the loot you will find Seltkirk's armor which enables the quest Courage Symbolized to be completed.
Follow the map arrow and talk to Dandelion about his role creating the anti-Henselt pamphlet. Then talk to Dethmold. At this point, the quest will come to a standstill, and it cannot be advanced until the Draug has been defeated in The Eternal Battle.
Upon awaking in the Kaedweni brothel, Dandelion tells you he overhead someone in the conspiracy was going to a meeting at the hut on the cliff, and that Dethmold has arrested multiple people suspected of being involved in the conspiracy. Upon traveling to the hut, Geralt finds a meeting with Vernon Roche and three Kaedweni nobles. Tensions in the meeting were high before Geralt's arrival, and when the Witcher reveals the names of those arrested, the conspirators realize their scheme is over and they disperse. Roche, however, realizes his men are in danger, and urges Geralt to rush with him back to their camp.
In the Blue Stripes' Camp, several Kaedweni soldiers are waiting for you and Roche, and they attack on sight. Upon defeating them, a prostitute appears, revealing that the Blue Stripes were invited into the camp for a feast. Inside the palisades, Roche and Geralt are again attacked by Kaedwenis. Upon defeating them, enter the camp's canteen. There, the Blue Stripes hang from the rafters. Ves is still alive, crying in the corner. She recounts the betrayal, after which Geralt urges Roche to avoid sacrificing his life in anger.
 "Do you want o hear how the witcher got embroiled into a high level conspiracy? Well, our hero was summoned before Dethmold - a bad beginning making a worse ending."
 "The sorcerer was aware that the witcher is interested in the curse placed on the battlefield, and pointed him to a clue. So it was that several soldiers hatched a plot apparently connected to the curse. Dethmold did not know what was the conspiracy's aim and who belonged to it. After getting this, oh how precise, clue, Geralt decided to nose around the camp."
 "How does one recognize a conspiracy? When you get a square coin, are told to go to the brothel, ask for Whistling Wendy and tell her to open the gates of paradise with her smile - then, beyond any doubt, you are dealing with a conspiracy."
 If Geralt talks to Dethmold about finding conspirator's hideout, he will give you 4 soldiers to help:
 "Geralt met with Dethmold and told him about the investigation's progress. The sorcerer gave him his best soldiers as backup, and told him to dig deeper."
 If Geralt asks Roche for help:
 "The witcher spoke to Vernon about the conspiracy, but Roche turned out to be unwelcome in Henselt's camp, and his every move was being keenly watched. In this, and every other case, his hands were tied."
 "Geralt didn't have a chance to chat with the conspirators. He had barely entered the basement where they were hiding when they lunged at him, swords in hand, believing him a spy of Henselt's Geralt killed them al in self defense, though not without satisfaction, as he was sore. When he did the deed, he sheathed his sword, looked about in search of trails connected to his investigation and then went to give Dethmold a report of his actions."
 "Oh, I almost forgot. In the plotters' hideout, Geralt found Seltkirk's chainmail, in the hands of one Traut. This brought him one step closer to lifting the curse."
 "At the plotters' headquarters, Geralt found a pamphlet denigrating King Henselt. I proudly admit to being its author. The witcher, however, should be ashamed, for he did not appreciate this well written lampoon and even dared reprimand me."
 "The witcher bombarded me with questions, but I did not have the answers he expected. The truth was prosaic, as it tends to be. Henselt had asked me to write a panegyric about His Royal Majesty, but, as a fully independent poet loyal only to the Arts, I could not accept this servile commission. Like witchers, I have my code. Instead of writing a song praising the king, I cooked up a beautiful lampoon that soon became famous among the soldiers. Geralt had found a copy of the work in question."
 "Learning nothing of interest from me, Geralt, admittedly dejected, decided to report his progress to Dethmold."
 If Geralt refuses the bounty on the conspirators heads:
 "It turned out there was a reward on the conspirators heads. However, Geralt didn't accept the money, faithful to the rule that witchers do not accept contracts on humans. Ridiculed by Dethmold and still poor, he left with his pride intact. That's a witcher's lot for you."
 If Geralt accepts the bounty on the conspirators heads:
 "It turned out there was a reward on the conspirators heads. Witchers don't usually accept contracts on humans, but since the killing was already done, Geralt took the money, reasoning that every coin was useful and Henselt would not grow poor."
 'Geralt's investigation had come to a stan"dstill. He had chatted with Dethmold and with me, but the solution to the mystery remained well beyond his reach. The witcher's discoveries had not moved things forward, a fact that soured his face. He decided to focus on other matters while waiting for new leads to appear."
 "Geralt defeated the draug, but nearly pad with his life for the victory. He was found unconscious and brought to the brothel in the camp followers' encampment. There, the witcher slept for three days, regaining his strength. And it was there that I found him. Seeing my friend in such a pitiful state, bruised and exhausted, I felt compassion overwhelming me. I told him what I had learned upon overhearing Whistling Wendy talking with one of the conspirators: that they would hold a meeting at the hut on the cliff. Thus I solved a mystery that had proved too difficult for the witcher's head."
 "You should have seen Geralt's face when he saw Vernon Roche talking to three other noble-born conspirators in the hut atop the cliff! Woe to the country whose intelligence relies on watchers! The Blue Stripes' leader's jaw dropped too, and fast, when he realized that the lives of his men were in danger. The head plotter and the man who had uncovered him rushed to the Kaedweni camp."
 "There a welcoming committee of Kaedweni men-at-arms awaited Geralt and Vernon. These were but a minor problem, however. A young prostitute who survived the slaughter by remaining neutral informed our heroes that Dethmold had invited the Blue Stripes to a feast in the camp's canteen."
 "The entire unit had been ambushed, captured and hanged. Roche had never been more furious in his life. He burned with a lust for vengeance and Geralt barely stopped him from doing something foolish. Henselt was just waiting for our heroes to make a mistake. He yearned to finish his own bloody vengeance, and was surely well prepared to do so. The only thing left to do was to save revenge for later and follow Sile de Tanserville, who had fled for Vergen."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;The Rotfiend Contract is one of three possible contract quests in Chapter II "". It is only available if Geralt chooses Roche's path.
 Rotfiend Contract
 "It is hereby announced that the good King Henselt, Lord of Kaedwen, offers a bounty for the extermination of rotfiends in the vicinity of the camp. The monsters must be eliminated once and for all, by any method. The brave soul that rids us of the rotfiends will be rewarded by Proximo, and his feat duly recorded in the chronicles of Kaedwen."
Walkthrough.
This quest can be acquired from either from the notice board next to the canteen, or from Proximo, who is standing near a fire with some soldiers, near the fighter's arena. Ask him if there are jobs.
If you speak with Sambor outside the camp (he is next to the small bright red tent) you can buy the from him.
There are a total of nine corpses to burn, spread out in three locations. The first location is near the camp followers' encampment, the second is past the tower, and the third is to the north of the camp within the ravines (on the way to the Visionary).
Note: On the map, the large B is the location of the notice board and the shields are the locations of the corpses.
 "Henselt's army was pestered by rotfiends. The creatures were dangerous in their own right, but also carried diseases which would spread among the army like gossip through a dormitory for high society girls. The witcher took up the task of slaying the monsters and went about it like a true professional - he killed individual specimens, and also read books about rotfiends."
 "He quickly discovered that rotfiends are necrophages. Their diet is made up of corpses, or even just bones from which they sucked marrow. Burning all the carcasses was the only way to rid the area of the monsters."
 "Geralt burned the unburied corpses around the camp, thus cutting off the rotfiends' food supply. Content with himself, he went to see Proximo about his reward."
 "Proximo was happy with the witcher's service. Geralt took a pouch full of orens and went to take care of other business."

A Score to Settle is a fistfighting quest which beings in Chapter II and ends in Chapter III of "".
Walkthrough.
This quest is activated when you do the fist fights in Roche's camp (Roche's side) or Vergen (Iorveth's side) in Chapter II. After completing all the fights, the quest is continued on in Chapter III.
 In the Blue Stripes' camp, after having the fistfight with Vernon, Geralt is approached by Burton, a beligerent Kaedweni soldier who challenges him to a fourth fight.
 Later, in Loc Muinne, the witcher chances upon the Kaedweni soldier once again and engages him in one last fistfight.
 In Vergen, after completing three fights Geralt is challenged by Silgrat, the younger brother of the war hero Seltkirk, who boasts being an accomplished fist fighter due to his heritage. However, beating him is just as easy (or hard) as any other fist-fighter. After losing the match Silgrat swears vengeance for being humiliated and walks away...
 Later, in Loc Muinne, the witcher chances upon Silgrat once again and engages him in one last fistfight.
Journal entry.
Chapter II
 Roche's path:
 "As you remember, the witcher had been training a bit with Roche's men. The Kaedweni soldiers watched the sparring with interest and, once the witcher was done, one of the onlookers challenged him to a duel. Zyvik interrupted the fight, however. The soldier left, angry, mumbling something about square coins. It would have been the strangest cursing in the world, if not for the fact that square coins were closely connected to the conspiracy against King Henselt. They were used by the conspirators as a secret symbol."
 Iorveth's path:
 If Geralt chooses not to fight Silgrat:
 "As you may remember, Seltkirk was the hero of the previous war with Kaedwen. Everyone in Vergen had heard of him, but his brother Silgrat was not nearly as faamous. Living in the shadow of his great brother, Silgrat became embittered, hungry for acclaim. He thought defeating a witcher in a fistfight would bring him glory. However Geralt refused and left, the knight's curses following him."
 If Geralt chooses to fight Silgrat:
 "As you may remember, Seltkirk was the hero of the previous war with Kaedwen. Everyone in Vergen had heard of him, but his brother Silgrat was not nearly as famous. Living in the shadow of his great brother, Silgrat became embittered, hungry for acclaim. He thought defeating a witcher in a fistfight would bring him glory. Geralt picked up the gauntlet."
 If Geralt wins:
 "When Silgrat barred Geralt's way, using lofty words to explain his intentions, the witcher shrugged impatiently. In the blink of an eye he beat the nobleman black and blue, ruining his plans for eternal glory. The knight's curses followed Geralt."
 If Geralt loses:
 "Silgrat barred Geralt's way, explained what he wanted and then attacked. You wouldn't believe, but the witcher lost. Silgrat left, proud as a peacock, and I am ashamed of Geralt to this day."
Chapter III
 Roche's path:
 If Geralt beats the Kaedweni soldier:
 "In the square of Loc Muinne, Geralt chanced upon a Kaedweni soldier he had met back in Aedirn. You might remember that the soldier had a score to settle with the witcher and, given the chance, decided to do so amid the picturesque scenery of the ruins. Geralt was no weakling, however, and beat the living daylights out of his opponent."
 If the Kaedweni soldier beats Geralt:
"In the square of Loc Muinne Geralt chanced upon a Kaedweni soldier met back in Aedirn. You might remember that he had a score to settle with the witcher and, given the chance, decided to do so in the picturesque scenery of the ruins. Geralt let his guard down and lost. The soldier left, content, and I am forced to report another of the witcher's defeats. What kind of a literary hero is he, allowing some nobody to give him a thrashing?"
 Iorveth's path:
 If Geralt beats Silgrat:
 "The witcher thought his adventure with Silgrat had ended. He could not have been more wrong. The nobleman attacked Geralt in the square in Loc Muinne square, and the witcher was forced to give him another beating. After that, he never saw Silgrat again."
 If Geralt loses to Silgrat:
"The witcher believed his adventure with Silgrat had ended. He could not have been more wrong. The nobleman attacked Geralt suddenly in the square in Loc Muinne and beat him black and blue. Thus was confirmed the old truth that if you believe something hard enough and work at it even harder, you will finally prevail."

Courage Symbolized is a quest in "". It is one of the four quests that must be completed to advance the quest The Eternal Battle, and it is also part of the Conspiracy Theory quest.
Walkthrough.
In the process of completing the quest Conspiracy Theory, Geralt was led to the basement of the old tower. There he faced Vinson Traut. After defeating him and his lackeys, Geralt took Seltkirk's armor which is the symbol of Courage, from his corpse.
 "Lifting a curse from a battlefield is no small feat. It requires preparation and a professional approach. The Witcher was fully qualified and, thanks to the advice of other professionals, knew exactly how to approach this thankless task. Among other things, he had to acquire artifacts of the battle, representing the virtues and horrors of war. The symbol of courage was one of them. The Witcher decided to enquire around the camp about the nature of this symbol, for nobody knows more about war than soldiers."
 "The armor ended up in the hands of Vinson Traut, a cutthroat. To obtain the artifact, the witcher had to find the knave."
 "The Witcher found Traut, rest assured. Their acquaintance was short, for Geralt slaughtered him not long after they were introduced. Traut was a member of the group scheming against Henselt and attempted to kill our hero when he burst into the conspirators' meeting. He made a mistake, but he did the Witcher a favor, since Geralt took Seltkirk's armor from his still warm body."
 "This way the Witcher acquired the symbol of courage."

Little Sisters is a quest in "".
IMPORTANT This quest has a very high chance to be bugged, it is recommended that you save before starting the quest, and also that you do all parts of it uninterrupted by other quests - to be safe, ignore the house until after the quest is complete. NOTE: One way it can be bugged is by selling Malget's notes to Dethmold before completing this quest.
Walkthrough.
This quest is available only if you side with Vernon Roche in Chapter I.
Upon entering the upper Kaedweni camp, Geralt sees Mavrick, one of the soldiers near the western exit, being harassed by other soldiers. He talks to the soldier, who tells him that he is being haunted by a ghost. He tells a tale of falling asleep by the riverside and being woken by the specter about an hour before midnight and being so frightened that he shit himself and was forced to return to camp with a "pantload". This is the source of his unfortunate nickname "the Crapper" and the reason why he is ridiculed constantly.
When Geralt asks him for more information, he tells the witcher to talk to one of the prostitutes by the whores' tent in the camp followers' encampment.
After talking to the prostitute, Geralt makes his way to the hut on the cliff, which is located south west of the camp followers' encampment, in a small ravine. Behind the hut (again, southwest), there is an alcove to containing four graves, one for Moira, Marissa, Murron and Malget. Geralt examines each of the graves closely and takes note of the symbols on Malget's grave marker.
He then returns to the hut and notices a pile of barrels covering up a trap door. He uses his Aard sign to remove the obstacle and descends to the cellar under the hut. There he finds three strange altars with a symbol carved on the front and a candle on top of each one. He decides to light the candles and see what happens. At first he tries randomly lighting the candles but this only seems to cause wraiths to spawn, though they are easily defeated.
Geralt then notices that the symbols on the altars match the symbols on the graves, so he decides to try the sequence on Malget's own grave — lighting the west candle first as it is marked with the "V", then the east candle as it has the diamond shaped rune "♢", and then the north candle which is marked with the "Λ". This causes a previously hidden door to open in the wall revealing a small chamber. Inside, Geralt finds a table with Malget's notes, but he can make no sense of them and decides he must find a wizard to translate (part of the quest "From a Bygone Era").
Geralt then decides to go to the beach and wait until 11pm (the time at which the specter appeared to Mavrick the first time). At the appointed hour, three specters appears, wraiths in fact. The leader tells Geralt that Mavrick was the one who killed her and her sisters, and that she is haunting him to get revenge. Geralt must then decide whether he believes her, or if he should talk to Mavrick again to confirm the story. He can choose to just kill her then and there, in which case he can return to the camp to tell Mavrick that the specters are dead earning the soldier's thanks. In that case, the quest ends with a 50 XP reward (recommended if you always get the quest bugged and cannot complete it in another way).
Is Mavrick lying?
If Geralt decides to confirm the facts with Mavrick, he goes back to the camp and talks to the soldier again. Then, he listens to Mavrick's side of things (which is still a bit vague on details) and after, tells the soldier to meet him back at the beach one hour before midnight to sort things out. He then makes his way back to the beach, meeting up with Mavrick by the entrance to the enclave. The two of them then walk down to the shore to meet the wraith together.
If Geralt accuses Mavrick of murder, the soldier gets angry and runs off. A trip back to the beach reveals that the specters have killed Mavrick. The wraith then laughs at Geralt for being easily fooled, pointing out that even she was worried he would not believe her story as it did not match the facts — specifically, she spoke of her two sisters, when in fact Mavrick only had two sisters and one "brother". She then disappears, summoning a "demon" (Bullvore) and the quest fails (the bullvore drops sword schematics for a Mahakaman Sihil).
The wraith once again tries to sow the seeds of doubt and Geralt must decide once and for all whether or not he believes Mavrick. If he decides at that point that Mavrick was lying (because he cannot adequately defend his actions), Geralt can leave him to be killed by the specters and the same scenario as before plays out with Mavrick being killed and the bruxa laughing at Geralt.
If Geralt sides with Mavrick and accuses the specter of lying, she summons her two "Little Sisters" and they attack the men. Luckily, they are easily dispatched (no special drop but a nice 300 XP reward). "NOTE: the actual reward is 600 XP, contrary to what is displayed after completing quest"
The whole story.
Once the specters are dispatched, Mavrick finally tells Geralt the whole story: Mavrick was lead scout for Vandergrift and used his family home as a base. His sisters were "dishonored" by the Aedirnian soldiers when he scouted beyond the river, driving Malget to kill his own children (though he claims innocence, and it is hinted that he may have been possessed by an evil spirit of his own summoning). Returning home, Mavrick found his father digging graves for his siblings in bloody clothes. The two fought and during the struggle, Malget fell to his death from the cliff behind the hut. Mavrick buried him, and has carried the guilt ever since. He speculates that the spirits of his sisters haunted him as a punishment for patricide, while the codex entry suggests they wanted all of the siblings united in the afterlife.
 "Geralt was walking through the camp and witnessed an unpleasant incident. One of the soldiers was unceremoniously barked at, beaten and heard derision and sneering instead of farewells. It did not look like a regular drinking brawl. The witcher always had a nose for finding jobs and sniffed a mystery hiding behind that row. He approached the soldier to learn what was that all about."
 "The ill-treated soldier's name was Mavrick. He was a veteran of the battle that had taken place three years before, yet he was not respected because he had shat himself after encountering a specter on a riverside beach one night. That event destroyed Mavrick's life - no wonder then that he hired the witcher to rid him of his nightmare. Hoping to encounter the phantom himself, Geralt decided to go to the beach at night. The trails also led to a lonely house on the cliff. The witcher knew that there's always a story connected with the appearance of a wraith, so he decided to ask Liva, a medic making a living from healing camp followers. Three years earlier the girl had helped to dress the wounds of the battle casualties - she was sure to provide a wealth of information."
 "Geralt was interested in the house on the cliff and asked among the camp followers. One of them, Liva, claimed that the estate had once been the abode of Malget, a folk healer. Five years ago, while the quack was tending to those wounded in the battle, someone murdered his children. In despair, Malget threw himself from the cliff."
 "Geralt explored the hut on the cliff and concluded that no one had lived in the ruined building for a long time. However, he knew from experience that abandoned buildings with a past tend to hide dreadful secrets. He decided to take a good look at the hut's surroundings."
 "While searching the hut and its surroundings, the witcher found the entrance to a cellar. Inside, the signs were unmistakable - magic rituals had been performed there. Our hero carefully examined the furnishings, hoping to learn more about the hut's past."
 "When Geralt lighted the ritual totems in the wrong order, a guardian ghost appeared. The witcher was more careful in his next attempt..."
 "When Geralt lighted the ritual totems in the proper order, the released magic opened the entrance to a secret room. The witcher started to search it."
 "Geralt found some old papers in the cellar of the house on the cliff. An old rule says that one should not disregard documents found in a haunted house, but these papers did not concern Mavrick's case directly. Therefore the Witcher hid them for later and returned to helping Mavrick."
 "There were three tombstones on the cemetery, with the following names inscribed: Moira, Marisa and Murron. Geralt also found the final resting place of the quack himself. It seemed suspicious that someone would fish out a suicide's body and bury it properly. Geralt even considered the croaker might have not killed himself at all. The name Murron - without doubt a male name! - was another mystery."
 "The specters claimed that Mavrick was responsible for the damned existence. He had murdered the three sisters and now they, as wraiths, craved revenge. The story seemed unclear and full of half-truths, so Geralt did not act hastily. He was unsure whether to trust Mavrick or the restless souls."
 "Geralt pressed Mavrick for information and learned that Malget was rumored to have colluded with demons. This meant that the mysterious specters could have influenced Mavrick when he was stationed in Malget's house and now wanted something from the soldier."
 If Geralt believes Mavrick:
 "Geralt agreed to meet Mavrick at the beach, an hour before midnight. He wanted to solve the mystery and hoped that after that night he would be able to decide who was right."
 "The specters tried to trick Geralt, yet the witcher knew how to separate the wheat from the chaff. He realized that Mavrick was innocent. Now he had to send the evil spirit to the beyond."
 "The specters were defeated and Mavrick's contribution to the victory has to be mentioned, as he fought like a lion at the witcher's side. Geralt completed the task, and solved Malget's secret on top of that. The healer had killed his own children during the war. Only his son had survived - Mavrick, who had murdered his father in revenge for the slayings. His siblings' phantoms had haunted Mavrick because they wanted him to join them in the beyond. Siblings should not be separated? Bah."
 If Geralt doesn't believe Mavrick:
 "Geralt carefully watched the events and decided that Mavrick was guilty. He handed him over to the vengeful specters. He knew that once they were sated they would pass into the beyond and stop tormenting the living."
"Geralt turned out to be a fool. The apparitions tricked him into letting an innocent man die."
"Geralt proved to be naïve after all. He allowed an evil spirit to grow in strength, caused the death of an innocent man, and barely escaped with his life."

Ave Henselt! is a quest in Chapter II of "" if Geralt chooses Roche's path.
In this quest, Geralt has the opportunity to individually fight three Kaedweni knights in the arena. If victorious, he can then fight Ves.
Notice board announcement.
Grand Tourney in the Arena!
"By the will of our gracious King Henselt, I hereby announce the opening of sign-ups for a grand swordsmanship tourney to take place in the camp arena. As expert swordsmanship is a soldier's virtue, anyone familiar with the craft of war is encouraged to apply. Whether kinsman or foreigner, man or woman – if you fear not the sight of your own blood on sand, I await you by the arena."
"Ave Henselt!"
"Proximo Woodblade"
Walkthrough.
The quest begins when Proximo approaches Geralt in the Kaedweni camp (after The Butcher of Cidaris has been completed), saying that Henselt is impressed with the witcher's skills and has called for a tournament to be organized. Geralt can take part by speaking with him again at the arena between noon and dusk. There are four opponents, with opportunities to rest or prepare after each of the first two duels. Each duel ends when either the opponent or Geralt yields (by pressing the key).
The first opponent is Gwydion, a dual sword wielding warrior with no armour. The second is Rendag, a fully armoured and shielded knight. The third is Borin, a lightly armored two-handed sword wielder. Immediately after Borin is the dual weapon wielding Ves. Yielding to any of the three Kaedwenis will cause the quest to fail.
After the duel with Ves, speak with her at the Blue Stripes' camp to end the quest. If she yielded to Geralt, there will be an opportunity to have sex with her.
 "King Henselt loved gladiator fights. One might even say he was something of a connoisseur. Naturally, he was eager to see the witcher – a famed swordsman – enter the arena to face Kaedwen's greatest swashbucklers. It was not long before Proximo, master of Henselt's arena, approached Geralt, requesting that he take part in a tournament. The fights were not to the death, but the slashes and thrusts were not at all feigned and real blood stained the arena's sandy floor. Fights took place from dawn to dusk. The witcher considered the offer briefly before finding Proximo in order to sign up."
 "A man named Gwydion was first in line. He fought bravely, but could not hold his own against the witcher's blade. Geralt could now enter the next fight."
 "During his clash with Rendang [], Geralt had the chance to practice sword fighting techniques he rarely used, for Rendang proved an unexpectedly easy opponent. The witcher won hands down and qualified for the next duel."
 "Borin, his next opponent, gave it his all, but still lost. No more Kaedwenis were willing to face the witcher in a fair fight. Henselt grew furious as a sow deprived of her young, and then Ves challenged Geralt. The girl was excited and the witcher saw how badly she wanted to win, how badly she wished to show all the men who had lost to the witcher what she was made of. Our hero considered what was more important to him – winning, or losing and making Ves happy."
 If Geralt yields to one of the Kaedwenis:
"Geralt might be a witcher extraordinaire, but he was a meager gladiator. In other words, he lost the fight and fell out of the tournament, becoming a hero unworthy of my prose. I continued to record his other adventures only because he paid my bar tabs."
 If Geralt yields to Ves:
 "The witcher decided to let Ves win, but he did it so clumsily that his intention did not escape her scrutiny. The girl bridled up and left, furious at the witcher. As you can see, Geralt could be grossly foolish and did not understand women at all."
 "The witcher tried to mollify Ves, but talk did not improve Geralt's situation. The girl, still furious with him, didn't want to hear his apologies. She had spent her entire adult life trying to match men and deal with discrimination, and had finally become the best soldier in Roche's unit. She saw the witcher's deed as an insult, for Geralt had presumed she was the lesser warrior. Our hero – having learned a lesson – decided to treat Ves as she deserved, but never managed to repair the damage. Thus ended the story of the arena fights."
 If Ves yields to Geralt:
 "The witcher decided that Ves would be furious if he threw the fight. So he defeated her, though not without effort, thus winning the tournament as a whole. Having received his reward, he thought it would be prudent to discuss the girl's ambitions with her."
 "When Geralt talked to Ves after the tournament, he discovered that she was very pleased, as he had taken her seriously in the arena. You should know that the girl had spent her entire adult life trying to match men and deal with discrimination, and had finally become the best soldier in Roche's unit. Geralt had recognized her abilities and given her due credit. As the feeling of mutual respect grew between the two, the physical distance between them shrank. What happened afterwards, I shall not say."

Against the Blue Stripes is a fistfighting quest in "".
Walkthrough.
This is the fistfighting quest in Chapter II if Geralt sides with Vernon Roche at the end of Chapter I.
Geralt stumbles upon Roche's men sparring with each other to improve their skills. The witcher then offers to fight them, out of curiosity mostly, but also to help them improve.
First he must face Fenn, then Silas. At that point, Vernon himself appears demanding to know what is going on. Upon hearing that Geralt is sparring with his men, Roche challenges the witcher to a little one on one.
 "Geralt liked to watch Roche's soldiers training. Their fighting style was different from that of the witchers, it was tailored to tackling armed opponents. In turn, Roche's men were always curious about the witcher's techniques and gladly pried at them. After talking to several of them, Geralt decided to try holding his own against Vernon's subordinates, but without weapons, just using fists. Fenn was first in line."
 "Fenn lost, obviously, but the Blue Stripes were undeterred. Silas was more than eager to face Geralt."
 "When Silas was also beaten, Vernon Roche had no choice but to defend his unit's honor."
 If Geralt defeats Roche:
 "It was a beautiful fight. I had my doubts about who would win for a long time. Yet if you had placed a bet on Geralt, you would have won. Roche lost, yet that was no dishonor in it. Vernon's soldiers, glad their commander had taken a beating, gave Geralt a nice piece of steel."
 If Roche defeats Geralt:
 "Either Geralt went about it half-heartedly or the special forces are even better than I thought – either way the witcher lost the bout. The soldiers were no longer interested in dueling Geralt."

&lt;/infobox&gt;The Butcher of Cidaris is a quest in "".
To gather further information about the square coin conspiracy, Geralt must defend Manfred's son, Sven, who is honor-bound to fight the Butcher of Cidaris in the arena. This quest is only accessible on Roche's Path, and is, along with In Cervisia Veritas and Lost Lambs, one of three ways to acquire a square coin needed to advance Conspiracy Theory.
Walkthrough.
In the canteen of the Kaedweni camp, Geralt meets a man named Manfred who is sipping vodka alone. The witcher invites himself and offers to buy the man a drink. Manfred agrees and proceeds to tell Geralt about his son Sven; to raise the army's morale, King Henselt has ordered duels to take place, and Sven has drawn lots to fight Letande Avet, the Butcher of Cidaris, in a duel to the death. Manfred is certain Sven will lose, but his son, unwilling to accept dishonor, refuses to back down from the fight.
Geralt convinces the old soldier to let him help Sven somehow. Ouside the canteen, Sven is practicing his skills. The witcher strikes up a conversation and after a bit of arm-twisting, manages to convince the boy that he can retain his honor by making it a 2-on-2 duel with the witcher as his second. Geralt then goes off in search of the Butcher of Cidaris to challenge him to the duel.
When he finds Avet and challenges him, another knight, Edwin Leistham, volunteers to be Letande's second. At first Avet just ridicules the man's epithet, but ultimately accepts him as a second.
The duel takes place in the Arena, with Henselt watching from above. If Sven survives the fight, he is awarded a knighthood. Outside the arena, Manfred reveals that Geralt should talk to Whistling Wendy and hands the witcher a square coin. The soldier also warns Geralt about Traut, saying that the man would certainly betray the conspiracy if caught, and that his magical armor would make him a tough challenge, even for a witcher.
Upon completion of the quest, Geralt is approached by Proximo, starting the quest Ave Henselt!.
 "On his way to the camp canteen, Geralt witnessed an argument between a father and a son. Though the witcher usually stays out of family quarrels, this one looked like a matter of life and death. Our hero had the mystery of the conspiracy against Henselt to solve and needed information. He had precious few friends in the camp but knew from experience that he'd be more likely to get a back scratch if he gave one first. Do someone a favor and they're likely to pay you back in kind. Geralt decided to talk to the old soldier. As it later turned out, this was a very good decision."
 "The old soldier was named Manfred. He needed help an agreed to help in the witcher's investigation on the condition that first Geralt will help out his son, Sven."
 "Sven was hot-headed. He wanted to face the famous Butcher of Cidaris in an arena duel. The lad would surely perish, so Geralt decided the fight would be in tandem, two against two. Now he only had to convince the menacing Letande Avet."
 "The Butcher of Cidaris did not need much convincing. Geralt went to get Sven and together they returned to Avet's tent. In the meantime, the Butcher of Cidaris readied himself for battle and awaited the arrival of his opponents."
 If Sven survives:
 "Not belittling anyone, Sven had a lot of luck, and Geralt some brains. Their opponents were defeated mainly because of the witcher's inhuman abilities. He however, thought nothing of a winner's fame. He solved Manfred's problem and expected the old soldier to tell him about the conspiracy."
 "Seeing his son in one piece, and basking in the glory of Letande Avet's vanquisher at that, Manfred was immensely happy. The old soldier kept his part of the deal and told the witcher everything he knew about the conspiracy."
 If Sven dies:
 "Geralt is a proficient and experienced swordsman, which means, among others, that in battle he looks after himself first. Sven proved to be hot-headed and lacking in ability, so he died. The witcher was not able to save the boy. With a heavy heart, he went to bring the bad news to his father."
 "The news of his son's death was a great blow to Manfred. Geralt didn't meet his expectations, but the old soldier helped him despite that, telling him everything he knew about the conspiracy."

Baltimore's Nightmare

Baltimore's Nightmare is a quest in "" and is only avaliable on Iorveth's path.
Walkthrough.
The quest begins after viewing the Baltimore's dream crystal (silver in color) at the sealed off harpy lair beyond the old quarry.
 "Geralt witnessed various wonders in the harpies' nest. Among others, he saw the dream of Baltimore, a dwarf who had once lived in Vergen. Baltimore was now dead, his dream - in which he was running in terror - having become a reality. Before the witcher would discover that, however, he would have to find the dwarf's house."
 "Geralt found the building from the dream. It looked like a workshop. He was about to enter it when he noticed some craftsmen working at anvils nearby. The witcher decided that if anyone knew anything about Baltimore's fate, these dwarves would."
 "Geralt was right - the building from the dream had indeed been Baltimore's old workshop. His former home stood right next to it and was now occupied by a dwarf named Thorak, Vergen's new rune master. The witcher learned that its former owner had vanished without a trace years ago and was considered dead. The story intrigued Geralt. He knew Baltimore had been living in fear, so he suspected there might be a secret behind the dwarf's disappearance. He decided to investigate and started by conducting a thorough search of the abandoned workshop of the former rune master, who had experienced the terrible nightmare."
 "It appears that dwarves tend to hide maps and keys in old furnaces. Geralt cleared the soot from his discovery, and the curious Thorak did not voice a single objection to his destruction of the furnace. The note was written in Elder Speech, a language the witcher knew, of course. It said: 'Start looking at the well where loud echoes dwell. Take ten paces t'wards the river, a walk left and do not shiver. A meager two tens of paces, pass the gate in my good graces. The one that our safety keeps. Go where the crossroads' patron sleeps. Every road you need to take, yet the middle one is safe. Heed and look for Ingrand's signs, and you'll follow my designs. Should you choose to go right, you'll soon see someone in plight. At noon this drowned soul points its shadow at your goal'. Geralt knew that an Ingrand's sign is the symbol of the patron guides, shaped like a circle with a line traced from it. The line always points to a shelter."
 If Geralt lies about finding Baltimore's notes:
 "Geralt understood that Thorak was only feigning indifference and in reality was very interested in his search. The dwarf was not to the witcher's liking. Our hero decided to continue his investigation while keeping an eye on Thorak. First he deciphered the notes."
 If Geralt shows Baltimore's notes to Thorak:
 "Thorak could not believe his own eyes when the witcher showed him Baltimore's notes. He asked Geralt to immediately notify him of every discovery"
 "The witcher found an Ingrand's sign. He went in the direction pointed by the line."
 "Following Ingrand's signs, Geralt found a key hidden by Baltimore. Now he needed to find the lock which the key fit. The witcher looked at the notes and followed the second path."
 If Geralt refuses Thorak's deal:
 "Thorak shadowed Geralt the whole time. He had a guilty conscience. The letter found by the witcher was irrefutable proof that Thorak had killed Baltimore. Our hero decided the Vergen elder should learn of this."
 "Cecil Burdon was shattered by the news of Thorak's crime. In one stroke a murderer was discovered and a rune master lost. The elder began to ponder the situation, yet he did not forget to reward the witcher for solving the mystery."
 If Geralt gives Thorak the notes:
 "Geralt was treasure hunting, and Thorak was spying on him. He finally told the witcher that recovering ancient rune lore, which had been lost with the previous smith, was of the utmost importance to him. Baltimore had been a genius, yet his talent had had a darker side - Thorak expected to find documents besmirching Vergen authorities among the hidden papers. Revealing these notes would cause a split in the town. And since Vergen's situation was difficult, any rifts would be very harmful."

Hunting Magic is a quest (Iorveth's path) in Chapter 2 of "".
Walkthrough.
After talking to Cecil Burdon and the others, your map will be updated with the location of the ruins in the forest. Once you venture out and kill everything that moves, you'll notice that the object you're looking for is on top of a plateau. Don't waste your time exploring all around it; to get to the top of it, you need to back track and walk on top of an earlier plateau, which does have a convenient ramp (if you look at the map, this plateau will look like a 'J' turned on its side) (even simpler it's by the shallow lake first crossing point). At the end of it, a "jump" command will appear. After two jumps, you'll get to the location. Some Harpies will attack you. In a ruin you will find a dream crystal.
Go back to Philippa and she'll tell you that the dream crystal you acquired is not powerful enough. Philippa will tell you that near the quarry there is an entrance to a harpy lair where more dream crystals may be found. But it is currently barred from entry so Philippa reveals some information which you can use to persuade Cecil Burdon to open up the barred entrance. After talking to Cecil, you will have gained access to the lair.
Upon entering the lair, you will be attacked by harpies numerous times (remember to bring 7 Harpy traps for The Harpy Contract, four for the quarry and three for the lair). Eventually you will come across the Harpy Queen who is putting a dream crystal into a projector. It shows a conversation between Letho and another assassin about the assassination of a king. Upon killing the harpy queen and her minions (don't let them surround you, it is instant death!), search around the place for other dream crystals. There are 4 of them. As soon as you acquire each of them, you will be attacked by a pair of harpies.
Put all the crystals into projector (after you retrieve Letho's dream from the projector).Below is a list of corresponding crystal colors and dreams:
The silver crystal will start the Baltimore's Nightmare quest and the red crystal will be powerful enough to cure Saskia, concluding the quest.
 "Having been poisoned during the council meeting, Saskia was dying, and nearly everyone who supported her cause now prayed for her health. Among her allies, however, were those who did not believe in gods, or at least in divine intervention. Lady Eilhart, the kind of woman who rolled her sleeves up and started casting spells when things got tough, fit this description. So when Geralt learned that a magical artifact was one of the ingredients for the Dragonslayer's cure, he reasoned that Philippa would be the ideal consultant. Therefore he decided to have a chat with her at her house."
 "One of the ingredients needed for the Dragonslayer's cure was a magical artifact, an item radiating powerful energy. The sorceress could not just create one on the fly, and time was against them. So the witcher headed outside to ask around the town about magical Intersections, ruins, legends of any treasure – in a word, about places where he could find an item of the kind he needed. Entering the streets, Geralt thought deeply about which townspeople would be best informed and about those who liked collecting stories."
 "Vergen's alderman told Geralt that a sorcerer had once lived in the nearby forest. With Cecil's map in hand, the witcher began his search."
 "And he found a crystal. Thanks to his medallion, he felt the magic pulsating within. The trophy seemed appropriate, so he took it to Philippa."
 "For a long time, Cecil Burdon refused to open the gate to the harpy lair. He warned that if the folk of Vergen were to see each others' dreams, this would shatter the already tenuous unity of the town's defenders. He also worried that nightmares could become real, and horrors incarnate would appear in Vergen's streets. Knowing the alderman's secret, the witcher blackmailed him. Cecil finally agreed to let Geralt into the harpy caves. What was this affliction that caused the dwarf to fold? Well, the alderman had promised his sister he would refuse himself alcohol to the end of his days. In dwarven society, where drinking is rampant, a teetotaler is ostracized. He is suspect, considered a squealer and a traitor to age-old traditions. He cannot be vested with public trust, so he cannot be an alderman, let alone a wartime leader. For the good of Vergen, which would soon face Henselt's might, and to save his nephew any shame, Burdon had decided to keep his abstinence a secret. Thus, he played into Geralt's hand, and the witcher kept the secret. He told only me, and I am the very embodiment of discretion."
 "Geralt was right - the harpy lair was full of dreams encased in crystals. He had only to find the one with the strongest magical aura."
 "Geralt found a truly unique place. It was the cave where the harpies viewed the dreams they stole. The witcher realized that a dream encased in a crystal could work as an ingredient of Saskia's cure, so he began looking for dreams and viewing them in the projector he found in the cave. He needed the most powerful one, the one most strongly emanating magic."
 "The witcher cast a net into the sea of dreams and fished out the very one he needed. A dream stolen from a dragon could contain enough magic to be useful to Philippa. Geralt had found another ingredient of Saskia's cure."

Royal Blood

"Something wrong with my face?"&lt;br&gt;This article or its infobox is missing an image. You can help by it.&lt;br&gt;Please do not upload images from other fan sites unless it's official artwork.
Royal Blood is a quest in Chapter II of "". It is part of Iorveth's path.
Walkthrough.
"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
You need royal blood to make the antidote for Saskia. This can come from Prince Stennis of Aedirn or from King Henselt of Kaedwen.
After the conversation in which you give Triss' bandana to Philippa Eilhart in order to locate her, a noble outside the sorceress' house will alert you to a commotion outside of Stennis' quarters. A peasant mob is demanding his death, believing him guilty of poisoning Saskia. Note that, "at this point", there is no time limit for resolving the mob. You may leave to accomplish other quests (It is also advised that you complete With Flickering Heart before this quest is even triggered by bringing Triss' bandana to Philippa, as this quest can make the former fail). Upon arrival, Dandelion and Zoltan Chivay will brief you on the situation; Iorveth will then step in to stall the rising violent tensions, asking you to investigate the matter.
You will not have time to question every relevant party during this quest. Or rather, you can only talk to three out of the four groups; The Dwarven Group, The Noble Group, The Peasant Group, and Stennis. Zoltan and Dandelion, and the Single Noble change the quest phase but do not add to the 'countdown'. Names of the NPCs will be randomised, so don't be worried if you can't find the NPC named in a walkthrough. You may talk to:
It's possible to speak to a total of five groups (Zoltan and Dandelion, The Single Noble and three out of the four other groups) of inquiry before a cutscene triggers and the mob demands Stennis be brought out to face them. However, speaking to three out of the four groups will trigger the cutscene before giving you chance to complete the sub quests. To maximize the experience it is best to talk to the dwarves and the peasants, then leave, finish the two sidequests, then return to Stennis' quarters. Completion of one side quest and returning risks triggering the cutscene without completion of the other.
Upon returning a cutscene will be triggered, wherein Silgrat (of A Score to Settle) will question you in defense of Stennis - depending on how much you found out, you will either automatically counter his arguments, or you must choose between conceding the point ("That's a good question") or supporting Kalten and the mob ("That makes sense"). Following the investigation properly insofar as possible nets you more experience, but in the end Geralt can still make the decision to set the mob loose on the Prince or see that he faces trial without having collected any "hard" evidence.
If you let the mob lynch the prince, you get the blood right then. If you let him live, you'll later have to convince Henselt to give it to you.
For consequences of this choice see The Decision Checklist.
 "It's a shame Philippa didn't demand a crocodile's tears and a sorceress' smile as ingredients of the antidote for Saskia. I believe the witcher would have had an easier time obtaining either of those. As it was, he had to acquire some royal blood - literally. There were only two potential donors in the area: Henselt and Stennis."
 "The blood coursing through the veins of Stennis, son of Demavend, was royal without a doubt. When a messenger arrived bearing news of a riot in front of the prince's abode, Philippa dispatched Geralt there immediately. Peasants recruited into the army were accusing Stennis of poisoning Saskia and threatening to lynch him, so there was no time to lose."
 "Luckily, Iorveth was faster than Geralt and managed to subdue the excited mob before any blood was shed. Yet the peasants were still furious. Left to their own devices, they would sooner or later force their way into Stennis' house. The witcher decided to see if the accusations of poisoning were justified. He began talking to those gathered in the square and also went inside to speak with the prince."
 "The nobility had their opinion, the peasants theirs. The man accused by the nobility was not guilty. They blamed Stennis for poisoning Saskia, as the peasant movements initiated by the Dragonslayer were not to his liking."
 "The noble born thought that a peasant bribed by Henselt poisoned Saskia. Serfs are always greedy for coin - the notables standing before Stennis' chamber claimed - they have no honor, they would sell their own mothers for a handful of copper."
 If Geralt finds the peasant:
 "Geralt found the allegedly bribed peasant but could not convince him to talk. Well, if bad luck haunts you, you're very likely to find that just when you're ready to get up and dance, the musicians need to leave to take a dump."
 "The craftsman claimed that the people of Vergen adored Saskia. Their love was so great, that they had a beautifully adorned goblet fashioned for the Dragonslayer. The dwarf so highly lauded the quality of the adornments inside the goblet that Geralt had a terrible thought: someone could have placed the poison within the goblet, and not in the wine Saskia had consumed."
 If Geralt dissuades the peasants from lynching the prince:
 "Geralt ruled that the Virgin of Aedirn should decide Stennis' fate. Of course the peasants did not like it, but nobody was keen on angering a witcher, nor to question Saskia's right to pass judgment. Everyone thought the girl's verdict would be just, that is condemning."
 "Stennis was captured and led away under guard. Geralt had only one source of royal blood remaining - Henselt of Kaedwen."
 If Geralt allows the peasants to lynch the prince:
 "Geralt passed judgment, and a stern judgment it was! The peasants ripped the prince apart. The death of the rightful heir to Aedirn's throne set in motion events the consequences of which affect us to this day. However, at that moment Geralt could think of nothing but obtaining a vial of royal blood. He hid it away in his jacket pocket as he walked away from the scene of the murder."
Bugs:.
In the Enhanced Edition, when you complete The Walls Have Ears and and get to Chapter 3, one or both of these 2 quests may be marked as Failed. You still get the XP because you completed them so it does not seem to matter.
However it does, you will notice this on the game Ending Epilogues. For example: Saskia lives and Stennis (as King Stennis I) lives = Stennis is not mentioned, meaning that the game is truly considering Stennis as killed, but not on the Journal. In other words, Stennis will be revealed that he did order Saskia's poisoning and has recived his well desired coronation. But after he becomes king, he will not be shown trying to oppose Saskia with the support of other kings.

Walkthrough.
Saskia has been poisoned and is barely clinging to life. Philippa Eilhart has given a list for items she'll need to cure her. The items needed are the following:
 "As you already know, Saskia, known to those who loved her as the Virgin of Aedirn and to those close to King Henselt as "That Insolent Wench", had been poisoned. There are numerous stories about how the witcher cured the girl, how he climbed a glass mountain and placed a healing kiss on her carmine lips. Well, none of those are true. Several unusual ingredients were needed to prepare the antidote, that is, a rose of remembrance, a dragon's dream, an immortelle and royal blood. The witcher began his search for these ingredients."
 "And when the witcher gathered all the ingredients, he headed for Philippa Eilhart's house with them."

Hatred Symbolized is a quest in Chapter 2 of "". It is a part of both paths in the game, and it is one of several quests that must be completed to advance The Eternal Battle.
Walkthrough.
Roche's path:
 Exit Vergen and walk past the burned village, head to your left through the stone archway. You will encounter a small shrine, with three paths open. The right path (to the right of the shrine) leads up to a dead end. The center path leads you to Elthon's hut and the old quarry. The left most path will lead you to to an entrance to the Tunnel of the Founders. Take the left most path.
 The entire region here is very dark, so you must use Cat potions or Flares in order to progress through the mine. Common enemies include nekkers and rotfiends, along with two bullvores. There will be a clearing in the mine where you fight a bullvore, past that room you will find Zoltan and Saskia, who will freely give you the Commander's sword.
Iorveth's path:
 If you sided with Iorveth in Act I this quest will be automatically completed upon completion of another quest, A Matter of Life and Death. Once Saskia recovers, she tells Geralt that he should simply have taken the sword while she was ill.
Journal entry.
Roche's path: Zabre Bayak Alawouz
 "Zyvik told Geralt that Vandergrift, the infamous butcher, had had a sword named "Hatred." If anything linked to the battle was the symbol of hatred, it was this very blade. Rumor had it that the weapon was in the possession of the Dragonslayer, and therefore seemingly out of Geralt's reach."
 "The course of events would finally carry the witcher to the other side of the mist. Geralt was sent to Vergen to acquire Yahon's spearhead, supposedly in Iorveth's possession. The sorcerer Dethmold helped our hero cross the cursed battlefield, and Geralt hoped to acquire "Hatred" on the other side, too."
 "Talking to Yarpen and young Burdon confirmed the rumor - Saskia had Vandergrift's sword. Zoltan was a dwarf and, unlike Geralt, he could enter Vergen, so he promised to acquire the weapon. The friends agreed to meet in an underground tunnel, a secret entrance to the town."
 "The corridors beneath Vergen, known as the Tunnel of the Founders, were considered secret. Nevertheless, Geralt managed to find the concealed entrance. Now, all he had to do was find his friend Zoltan somewhere down there."
 "Sending Zoltan out on an espionage mission is like asking a bear to knit you a sweater - nothing good is likely to come of either. Dwarves are just ill disposed to doing things discreetly. The plan to get the sword secretly proved a miserable failure. At the meeting place, Geralt found not only Zoltan, but also Saskia. The Dragonslayer had squeezed the dwarf for information and plucked it from him one word after another. She then expressed a desire to meet the witcher personally. Luckily, Saskia proved to be a wise and compassionate person. After a courteous discussion she honorably handed Geralt the sword."
Iorveth's path:
 "The witcher learned that to lift the curse from the battlefield he would need mementos of the battle representing the virtues and horrors of war. He was concerned because he knew very little about the clash between the Aedirnian and Kaedweni armies. Philippa Eilhart then told him to see Cecil Burdon, Vergen's alderman, who was reputed to b e a real trove of knowledge on the subject. Geralt went off to question the dwarf about the battle."
 "Cecil did not disappoint. He knew a lot and gladly shared his knowledge. The alderman told Geralt that the symbol of hatred could only be the sword of the infamous Vandergrift, bearing the dreaded but fitting name of "Hatred". Unfortunately, the blade belonged to Saskia the Dragonslayer, who had been poisoned and lay dying. Though the witcher had stolen from the dead or dying in the past, in this instance he decided to stay his hand."
 "The healed Dragonslayer had no objections and handed the Witcher Vandergrift's sword while expressing her gratitude. Our hero acquired the symbol of hatred."

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
Hey, Work's on in the Mines! is a quest in Chapter II of "". It is done more or less concurrently with Subterranean Life.
Walkthrough.
When you first enter, there will be three paths. The order you should explore them in (viewing from the map screen) is west, then east, then middle. At the end of the west path will be a body with a key, which opens the door in the east path (this door is tucked away in a corner and can be easily missed). In all you will find 3 different bodies containing three different keys.
There will be a point where you come across one of the nests, but clicking the when it says "collapse tunnel" will do nothing if you do not have grapeshot bombs in your quickslots (although the game text says "beehive"). Ideally you should have purchased these in the previous chapter from Cedric or made them yourself.
There are grapeshot bombs in the storage room, at the end of the southernmost point, in a small room which requires a key to open. There you'll find 3 in a chest. The body in which the key drops is at the end of a passage filled with snare traps near the end of the map, so you'll have to run the whole mine again to complete the quest...
You can always buy the grapeshot diagram and make yourself the bombs you need.
 "The people of Vergen had worked in the nearby mines from time immemorial. Their excavation was halted, however, once monsters began multiplying there. How happy must the elder, Cecil Burdon, have been when a witcher arrived at his town. The dwarf promised a hefty reward for clearing the beasts out from the underground tunnels."
 "Geralt headed beneath the ground and started looking for the cause of the problems. He quickly discovered that the miners had delved too deep and had broken through to ancient tunnels carved by creatures never meant to see the light of day. The creatures were entering the mines through fissues in the rock, and Geralt decided to collapse these branches using bombs known as beehives."
 "The monsters were exterminated and the breaches they had used to enter the mine shafts were collapsed. There was nothing else to do but head to Cecil Burdon for the reward."
 "Vergen regained its mines. The elder was pleased and rewarded our hero."

The War Council is a quest in Chapter II of "".
Walkthrough.
The War Council is a meeting of the leaders of Vergen called by Saskia to discuss the impending battle with the Kaedwenis camped across the river. In attendance are Cecil Burdon, Zoltan Chivay, Yarpen Zigrin, Prince Stennis, Geralt and a few of the nobles.
The relative disparity in the number of fighting men available is discussed. Aedirn has about 200 dwarves, roughly 500 peasants, 53 knights with 200 armed men, and as Saskia reveals, 100 elite elven archers, to be led by Iorveth who will face Henselt's trained army of 5000 making it about a 5:1 ratio in favour of Kaedwen.
 "After reaching Vergen, Saskia and Stennis left Geralt to his own devices. The elder, Cecil Burdon, greeted the witcher. It turned out that because of the Kaedweni threat, the gates will be closed. A debate was to be held, where all attendees would discuss how to end that threat. The witcher was invited too, but at the moment he could rest in a room at he local inn provided for him. Following Burdon's nephew to the inn, our hero thought deeply about Upper Aedirn's situation."
 "In spite of its dwarven standards, Geralt's room at The Cauldron proved quite cozy. The witcher settled in and, once ready, ventured out to attend the war council."
 "My, was that ever a debate. Those attending discussed how best to repel Henselt. There were as many positions and proposals as there were debaters and disputants. Luckily, the witcher's task was simple – to life the curse from the battlefield with Philippa Eilhart's help, thus getting rid of the ghastly mist and allowing the armies to move against one another. The witcher would have started right away, glad to leave the debaters spewing words and spittle, but a tragedy occurred – Saskia was poisoned. The dying girl was moved to her house, while Geralt, Iorveth and Cecil went to its door to await news. When only Philippa emerged, the witcher began questioning her about the Dragonslayer's condition."
 "And Saskia's condition was bad, and still deteriorating. The witcher not only had to find a way to life the curse from the battlefield, but also get an anitdote for the poison coursing through Saskia's veins as fast as possible."

Subterranean Life

Subterranean Life is a quest in Chapter II of "". It is done more or less concurrently with Hey, Work's on in the Mines!
Walkthrough.
In order to help Philippa concoct a cure for the poison ingested by Saskia, the witcher must collect ingredients, one of which is the fabled dwarven immortelle which grows only underground.
To enter the abandoned mine in Vergen, Geralt first has to get permission from Cecil Burdon. Once in the mine, he must contend with nekkers and rotfiends. At the end of the tunnels, he must face a Bullvore along with waves of nekkers until the Bullvore is defeated. Finally, the witcher finds the elusive flowers.
 "To call Philippa Eilhart a healer is like calling a drowner an advertiser of swimming. Nonetheless Philippa was a sorceress, a powerful one at that. Though healing was not her specialty, she could help the poisoned Saskia. To create a cure, she needed special ingredients, a dwarven immortelle among them. Geralt started the search with asking one of his dwarven friends staying in Vergen. Zoltan, for he was said friend, tarried in the local inn."
 "Because a dwarven immortelle only grows underground, Geralt had no choice but to enter the mines. He needed the consent of Cecil Burdon, the Vergen elder, first."
 "One can find more than rare herbs in abandoned mines. Monstrosities - both those rare and common - too. Rotfiends are among the most common monsters, but cannot disregard them. Geralt remained as vigilant as ever. He had to go deeper to find the immortelle, and there were more rotfiends down there."
 "In the darkest depths of the mine, where bats stumble over moles, Geralt finally found the herb. He headed for the surface, content that he could now focus on searching for the remaining ingredients."

&lt;/infobox&gt;Death Symbolized is a quest in Chapter 2 of "". It is a part of both paths in the game, and it is one of several quests that must be completed to advance The Eternal Battle.
Walkthrough.
Cecil Burdon (Iorveth's Path) or Zyvik (Roche's Path) tells Geralt that the lost standard of the Dun Banner may be seen as a symbol of death, and that he can likely find it in the dwarven catacombs outside Vergen (on Iorveth's path, it is advisable to complete this quest in conjunction with the quest With Flickering Heart to save time).
In the catacombs Geralt encounters numerous wraiths, corpses to examine (one of which is part of With Flickering Heart and requires the surgical tools for an impromptu autopsy), and weakened walls to tear down with Aard.
The Wraith guarding the Dun Banner standard introduces himself as "Ekhart Henessy – ensign and color bearer of the Dun Banner". He is hidden behind a weakened wall on a lower level of the catacombs. Geralt can then choose to either deceive the Wraith by pretending to be a former member of the Dun Banner, or destroy it.
To deceive the Wraith, Geralt uses the following dialogue answers (All the information required to answer these questions is furnished by talking to Zoltan Chivay, Yarpen and Sheldon at The Cauldron, or to Zyvik at the Kaedweni camp):
If the witcher answers incorrectly, the Wraith attacks him. However, if Geralt is in possession of a beaver cap and / or the Dun Banner cloak the wraith concedes that he might actually be a former Dun Banner member and allows him to give one incorrect answer without triggering a fight (the beaver cap is obtained by finishing Baltimore's Nightmare (Iorveth's path), or from Zyvik in the Kaedweni camp (Roche's path).
After successfully deceiving the wraith, Geralt gets the Dun Banner's standard and the Sword of the Dun Banner by looting the sarcophagus. If he destroys the Wraith instead, the sword is not there and he gets only the standard.
The quest is complete once Geralt takes the Standard.
Roche's path:
 "It seemed very likely that the standard of the Dun Banner, the famous unit of Kaedweni light cavalry, was the symbol of death, and thus one of the artifacts Geralt needed to lift the curse from the battlefield. At least so thought Zyvik, King Henselt's soldier who'd seen a lot in life. The witcher decided that where war craft was concerned, the veteran could be trusted. Unfortunately, the standard was buried with the fallen men of the unit in the dwarven catacombs on the other side of the spectral mist. For now, the symbol of death remained beyond our hero's grasp. The witcher needed to cross to the other side of the mist, but was forced to wait for an opportunity to do so."
 "And the opportunity arrived when Geralt was forced to go to Vergen in search of a spearhead supposedly in Iorveth's possession. With Dethmold's help, the witcher could pass through the mist and use the opportunity to look for the standard as well."
 "Geralt met Yarpen Zigrin and Skalen Burdon in Vergen and they told him about the catacombs in the forest. The Dun Banner's standard rested somewhere in the depths of the tomb. So the Witcher headed into the forest, looking for the crypt's entrance."
Iorveth's path:
 "One of the artifacts needed to lift the curse from the battlefield was to symbolize death. Having no idea what he was to look for, the witcher took Philippa's advice and decided to talk to Cecil Burdon. Vergen's alderman knew a lot about the battle between the Kaedweni and Aedirnian armies, so he would likely give Geralt a good lead."
 "After hearing the witcher out, Cecil Burdon stroked his beard and began his tale of the Dun Banner. The Dun was a unit of Kaedweni light cavalry, known far beyond the borders of Henselt's kingdom. Its soldiers had taken part in the battle, and their standard, easily recognized by any veteran from the North, could very well be the symbol of death. The unit's standard was buried in the forest crypt, alongside the fallen soldiers. The witcher had to find the tomb and the artifact."
 "The dwarves told the truth, the standard was indeed in the catacombs. But the symbol of death had a guardian - the wraith of a Dun Banner veteran. The Witcher could acquire the item he sought by defeating the ghost in battle or by using deception. The latter choice would force him to impersonate a unit member and appeal to an old brother-in-arms."
Destroying the Wraith
 "Geralt destroyed the wraith. Now nothing stood between him and the standard."
Deceiving the Wraith
 "Geralt managed to deceive the ghost and it showed him the sarcophagus containing the Dun Banner's standard."
 "The symbol of death was now in the hands of Geralt of Rivia. The curse would soon be lifted from the battlefield."

Death to the Traitor! is a quest in Chapter I of "".
Walkthrough.
If Geralt sides with Vernon, he must join the Blue Stripes in their plan to kill the corrupt commandant of Flotsam, Bernard Loredo. In so doing, they also root out a Kaedweni spy, one Arnolt Malliger.
Roche then outlines the plan for the assault on Loredo's compound. Ves will enter Loredo's house in disguise and open a window. Geralt will then use this window to gain access to the house and proceed to the third floor, where Loredo awaits. Though the Blue Stripes will set up a ladder for Geralt to enter the compound, there is an alternative entrance which Roche does not mention.
Over the wall: Near the far end of Flotsam and the wall by Loredo's compound, Roche's men have set up a ladder. Geralt must wait until dusk to use the ladder, then climb over the wall and into the compound. Here he sees Arnolt chasing Helena through the area, and is given the choice to avoid the man or walk up behind and stun him. Whatever the choice, Geralt must then contend with several guards, either through stealth and stun or direct confrontation. After the guards are taken care of and Geralt has looted the key, he meets with Helena.
Through the cave: Geralt must head down into Flotsam harbor, to the cave explored during the quest Malena. A large horde of nekkers must be dealt with before proceeding on to the end of the cave, where a ladder waits. Geralt can then ascend the ladder and arrive right next to Helena. An extra 400 XP is awarded for using this path.
Whatever route is taken, Geralt talks with Helena and then climbs the scaffolding nearby to enter through the window. Geralt proceeds through the first level, taking care of the guards, until Marietta Loredo is encountered in a cutscene. Be prepared for a QTE and loot Marietta's key from her body once it is over.
Geralt then heads up the stairs and opens the door to find himself in a familiar area. Deal with the guards around the corner and head up more stairs. In the room full of sleeping guards, avoid breakable objects and loot the key to Loredo's room.
At the top of the stairs, open the door and watch out for another QTE, as Loredo charges in. Geralt must now face off against Loredo, who uses a halberd with a long reach. However, Loredo has no defense, and a valid strategy is to back him into a corner and attack repeatedly.
Following the fight, Geralt must untie Ves and go into the next room, where a pregnant Moril awaits. As Geralt is escorting Ves and Moril down the stairs, Moril begins to give birth. Geralt must now defend Ves while she tends to Moril. In addition, the sleeping guards have woken up and must be dealt with.
Geralt then exits the tower and moves into the courtyard, where a full on battle between the Blue Stripes and Loredo's men is taking place. Roche will show up and help Geralt deal with the rest. A series of cutscenes then begin, during which there is a QTE for Geralt to punch a soldier who insults Moril and elves in general. Moril gives birth to a healthy baby, but then commits suicide. As Geralt sails away with Roche, he sees Seherim on the shore with Moril's child.
"Who would have thought things would turn out so badly? Triss was kidnapped, Geralt had made new enemies, and his allies drove a hard bargain. The witcher wanted to find his lover and get Foltest's killer above all else, so he had to bend his rules for the sake of his priorities. Our hero agreed to kill Loredo and the decision was, unsurprisingly, very easy. According to the plan, Geralt was to meet Roche's men after dark, in an alley behind the commander's mansion."
If Geralt enters through the cave west of the Flotsam harbor, instead of following Roche's plan:
 "From his own experience Geralt knew that witchers are rarely let in through the front door. He didn't care about Roche's plans at all, and led by his infallible instinct he found a secret passage to Loredo's garden. A passage through a cave full of monsters."
If Geralt encounters Arnolt:
 "Sneaking through the garden of Loredo's mansion, the witcher came upon a foreign merchant. He froze for a moment, unsure of how to deal with the inconvenient witness - avoid or dispose of him? But then. in an instant, he chose his path."
 If Geralt chooses to avoid Arnolt:
 "Geralt decided not to cause unnecessary noise and gave the amorous suitor a wide berth."
 If Geralt chooses to dispose of Arnolt:
 "When the lustful foreigner fell to the ground and stopped causing trouble, our hero thought it would be prudent to look for the lass the would-be lover did not manage to catch. Helena - for that was the girl's name - was apparently angered by the man's less-than-gentle attentions and could prove to be a valuable ally."
If Geralt encounters Helena:
 "Geralt found Helen by the window that Ves was supposed to open. Helen was not only experienced in her profession, but also knowledgeable about Loredo's private life. She told the witcher that the instant she had seen him sneaking over the wall, she had known that it was him that Ves had whispered of. "The window in the addition," Ves had managed to say before Loredo snatched her away. Geralt also learned that the commandant had locked himself in the tower, junked up like an entire pack of bandits, together with Ves and a local elf. Though now in a hurry, Geralt acted methodically. First, in a bid to find a key to the upper quarters, he paid a visit to Marietta Loredo, who was producing fisstech in the mansion's basement."
"The witcher slaughtered the commander's mother without much ado, thus obtaining the key to the tower's upper floors."
If Geralt approaches the door to Loredo's room without having the key:
 "At the door to Loredo's room Geralt heard the commander's monologue, in which Loredo plainly explained his sexual preferences without false modesty. Unfortunately the door was locked, so our hero could not turn the monologue into a short dialogue. Understanding that time was of the essence, he began looking for a key. He thought the guard sergeant responsible for protecting the upper floor may have it."
"There, in a chest by the guard sergeant's bed, the witcher found an ornate key. He promptly put it in his bag, sure the thing will prove useful."
"The witcher did as he promised - he killed Loredo. Those who mourned the commander shed false tears, and those cheering outnumbered them greatly. I think that even though Geralt murdered a man he made the world a better place. Perhaps not on a grand historical scale, but certainly on the scale of the hapless and downtrodden."
"Geralt found Moril, an elven girl, in the tower. The elf, in the final stage of pregnancy, needed to be brought outside as fast as possible."
"It turned out that it is easier to get inside Loredo's mansion, than to get outside. The terrified Moril started to deliver her child, but this time the witcher was spared the difficult challenge. As skillfully as a certified midwife, Ves took charge of the delivery, proving claims that Roche's men are versatile. Geralt just had to buy the young mother some time, so he joined Vernon, who was holding back the attack in the courtyard."
"As always, the cavalry came late, though Roche later boasted that he had saved the witcher's skin. The battle in the courtyard of Loredo's mansion ended with a clear victory for the good guys. The enemy was beaten, disarmed or routed."

Cecil Burdon was the town Elder of Vergen at the time of the Third Pontar war and the uncle of Skalen Burdon.
Biography.
Cecil was an advisor to Vergens town Elder and took part in the Second Lormark war when the Kaedweni army lead by Vandergrift crossed the Pontar (river) to conquer Upper Aedirn. Being part of the Vergen Dwarf unit he saw the duel between the Visitor and Seltkirk, witnessing the later being killed. In the ensuing chaos caused by Sabrina Glevissig's use of Melgar's Fire Cecil scrambled to safety as all the other participants in the battle did. He managed to survive the battle and return to Vergen.
When in Vergen he volunteerd to replace the previous Elder, who had been killed, no one opposed him and he thus became the town's new Elder. At some point after this he took in his nephew Skalen Burdon after his parents were killed in a Pogrom. Skalen's mother had made Cecil promise to remain sober to the end of his days, a promise he kept but also kept a secret. As town Elder he mostly managed the cities trade and finances, put up contracts on monsters and kept the town safe from threats.
Cecil supported the peasent rebellion started by Sakia the Dragon Slayerin Aedirn and allowed them use of Vergen. He followed Saskia in her attempt to defeat the invading Kaedwen army and establishing a free nation in the Pontar Valley with Vergen as it's capitol.
"On Iorveth's path:"
Cecil was part of the war council that took place after negotiations with king Henselt broke down and a cursed fog decended upon the valley. During this meeting he voted in favour of allowing Iorweth and his Scoia'tael to stay and aid them in the war despite his deep dislike of them.
After Saskia's poisoning he helped the Witcher Geralt of Rivia in searching for the ingedients neccesary for the cure and the items needed to lift the curse. Guiding the witcher in his search with his deep knowledge of the area and it's history. When Geralt required acces to the harpy lair he turned to Cecil as his grandfather had locked it. After Cecil's initial refusal to open the lair and potentially endager Vegen the witcher used Cecil's secret to blackmail him into opening the gate. He would later also assist Geralt with his investigation into Olcan Grandemot when the peasants went after prince Stennis by providing Geralt with the location of the priets home. Cecil would participate in the defense of Vergen after the fog was lifted.
Cecil likely died during the battle as when the Pontar Valley was a free realm the position of Elder in Vergen was vacant and later filled by Barclay Els.
"On Roche's path:"
After the Kaedweni victory and conquest of Upper Aedirn, Cecil was hanged in Vergen alongside his nephew.
"When we arrived in Vergen, we learned that the town's elder was named Cecil Burdon. This former dwarven miner was typical of his kin - realistic, substantive and possessed of a sober outlook. Vergen needed an administrator like that, so Burdon was, beyond all doubt, the right dwarf in the right place."

Arachas

Arachas, or crab spiders, are large insectoids with a distinctly large abdomen. Described as an extremely venomous, its variants are found in both desert and swamp regions. The varieties found in the Ysgith tend to have mouths that resemble a large orchid.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Geralt encounters the Arachas in a forest clearing after meeting Iorveth. This takes place close to the end of Chapter I during the quest The Assassins of Kings.
The arachas is easily dispatched using a silver sword. It drops some reagents including the arachas eyes and armor. The eyes are used for restoring the power to the amulet in the quest Melitele's Heart.
On Roche's path, a second arachas is encountered at the end of a ravine northeast of the Kaedweni camp, near a lone dead conifer. There is a third arachas in a ravine guarding the Mage's gloves, this is accessible to both paths.
On Iorveth's path, an arachas is encountered in the cave on the way into Loc Muinne.
By Chapter 2, Geralt's level should be high enough for the Arachas to not give XP when killed.
"Arachnids are lone hunters - they patiently wait for their prey to kill it with one swift strike when it appears. The same is true for the arachas, a huge creature that took a liking of the riverside forest, becoming it's undisputed king. A ruler who does not tolerate other hunters on it's territory. Including witchers."
"Arachasae are large, slow and protected by a durable armor. The carapace, as the witchers call this armor, is especially tough from the front, so it is much easier to wound the creature from the side or the back. The arachas' charges make an excellent for that - one has to evade the charge at all costs by stepping out the beast's way, and then make one's blow. Without doubt it's the best to use the strong style then."
"The arachas has no fear of poison, and not much fear of fire. It's primitive nervous system barely reacts to wounds, and it's incredible vitality allows it to take even great wounds. The beast will heal them after the fight anyway, all the while digesting its prey."
"All said and done, the arachas is a bug, so one's blade should be coated with the Insectoid Oil before fighting it. The monster's susceptibility to this blade coating is probably its sole weakness. The beast can easily all shrug off other witcher tricks, so common poisons and Signs are of no use, not to mention attempts to knock the colossus down."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading The Illustrated Atlas of Insectoids.
 "N'aracche aen woed endicen [Let sleeping arachasae lie].– Elven proverb"
 "Powerful pincers, a maw filled with razor-sharp teeth and venom glands packed with deadly toxins – these creatures constitute the arachas' deadly arsenal. Since people and farm animals make up an important part of these creatures' diet, contracts on arachasae in turn constitute an important source of witcher coin."
 "Once native to the far south, this invasive species migrated north over the course of decades, adjusting as it went to new climates and temperatures. It found damp woodlands and swamps most hospitable and made them its home, making use of the much and moss found there as blankets during its winter hiberation. The arachas hides its unprotected, sack-like abdomen under a covering of hollow tree-trunks worn on its back."
 "At first glance, a stationary arachas often looks like a part of the forest undergrowth, a fact it uses to deadly advantage when hunting. It usually begins a battle by spitting venom, then tries to grab its prey with prehensile feelers in order to drag it within reach of its crushing pincers."
Combat tactics.
The Arachas hits hard plus its attacks are laced with poison. If players attempt to run away or keep a distance from this overgrown spider it will respond by shooting a sticky web stream which binds Geralt in place for a few seconds allowing the Arachas to charge in. Blindly hacking away at the Arachas from the front is unwise as it will cover itself with its pincers to mitigate damage and open Geralt up to a vicious counter-attack which can knock down.
Because of its size, Aard isn't going to knock it down no matter how high the Sign intensity. The other Signs are effective; Igni can immolate the Arachas allowing players to get in 1-2 strong hits, Quen nullifies the damage from one attack, Yrden slows the insect down to facilitate flanking and Axii keeps the Arachas pacified long enough to get into position for a slash at its less-protected rear.
The armoured arachas and venomous arachas can be fought using the same strategies and tactics as a regular Arachas, the only difference being the former taking more hits to go down while the latter's venom makes Golden Oriole a necessity for neutralising the potent poison.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Draugirs are demons of war. They arise at sites of exceptionally vicious, bloody battles. They are bloodlust and hatred in condensed form, according to Geralt.
 "The draug is a commander, and his wraith soldiers are called draughirs. The draug's will calls them into existence on battlefields or in cemeteries. Like the draug, they are borne of damned souls and trapped shells created from the remnants of arms and armor, machines and corpses torn apart by scavengers."
 "The draugirs are absolutely bound by the draug's orders. They feel no fear or pain, they cannot be forced to retreat. They are ideal soldiers. Their coming is always sudden, so one must remain constantly vigilant in the presence of their leader, for his subordinates appear in dire moments to defend the draug and tip the scales in his favor."
 "These wraiths are protected by heavy armor and a shield. A witcher should first force them to expose themselves, knocking away their shields and grinding down their armor. The best chance to wound the creature comes when the draugir charges. One should evade the attack and lunge at its unprotected back. The monsters are slow in the battle, so one needs to weaken them methodically with strong sword blows, and then finish them off. In life, draugirs were soldiers or knights, and in death they retain their proficiency in combat, so one needs to defend oneself against their blows - their lethal counterstrikes in particular - with extreme care."
 "The draugirs are susceptible to the Specter Oil, so one should coat a silver blade with it before battle. Poisons and oils increasing bleeding are of no use. These wraiths can be defeated using fire, but the silver sword is, of course, the most effective."

For a Higher Cause!

For A Higher Cause! is a quest in Chapter III of "". This quest is only available on Iorveth's path, the corresponding quest on Roche's path is For Temeria!.
Walkthrough.
You will start in the mountains of Loc Muinne together with Iorveth. While walking down the path, you will encounter several harpies. At the foot of the hills, you will have the choice to:
Note: If you had imported a saved game from "The Witcher" and were on good terms with the Order of the Flaming Rose in that particular game, they will be friendly towards you. If not, they will attack on sight, which is also their default behaviour if a saved game was not imported.
If you choose to follow Iorveth through the caves, you will encounter two Arachas at the enter of the cave, and another one later down the way along with some Endregas. After getting rid of the two first, don't forget to plunder their nest at the end of the corridor, you should find some pretty neat loot. Upon exiting the cave, follow Iorveth into the city to the courtyard with the gargoyles (they explode after being killed).
Note: Ignore the chest in the room below for now - it is part of the quest An Encrypted Manuscript.
Continuing through the ruins, ignoring the doors leading to the enemy soldiers, you will get to a passage, where there are 4 soldiers on its end. Iorveth will start talking to you on how to get to Philippa Eilhart:
Note: There are a few quests throughout the map.
"(If you choose to get arrested by the soldiers, there might be a glitch in game that makes all your Bombs and Daggers to disappear though you will still have the weight from them, you can get them back by adding same thing to same spot or taking same thing from warehouse and they will magically appear again.)"
The fastest way is to simply attack the soldiers and let your health bar drop to zero. Another way is to find the poker players about a table in the merchants area of Loc Muinne. Instead of playing dice, have Geralt insult them. After winning the fistfight, Redanian soldiers will approach and the conversation ends in Geralt being arrested.
Either way, you will be stripped of your armor and weapons and brought to the dungeons, where you can talk to Philippa about her bewitching Saskia. Once the dialogue is over Radovid will approach, order Philippa blinded and after some more talk, will leave again to participate in the debates in the city. The ambassador meanwhile believes you a threat and will order you killed. Use the Igni sign (fast mouse-clicking) to free yourself of the shackles and fight the guards.
The other way is to walk to Philippa in the dungeons all the way by using the sewers. The sewers are accessed via a small building entrance next to the Mighty Numa. It should not be confused with the other locked entrance which is guarded by two soldiers.
Whichever way you choose, the executioner will blind Philippa in front of you and you will have one big decision to make:
To either help Philippa home to get an item that'll free Saskia from her control, or to go save Triss. (500XP in either case)
If you go with Philippa, Letho will save Triss.
 "Behold the last part of the story about Geralt and the assassins of kings. In his search for the kidnapped Triss Merigold and the treacherous Síle de Tansarville, Geralt arrived at Loc Muinne, an ancient city once inhabited by the elves. The witcher was in the company of Iorveth. Truly, should Geralt lead a Manticore on a leash, he would attract less attention from onlookers."
 "Meanwhile - the irony! - knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose made camp by the city gates. There was no way an elf, nay, one of the most famous and most wanted Scoia'tael, got through that gate without being accosted by the knights. Iorveth turned from the path in order to find another way into the city, and Geralt faced a dilemma: to follow him, or to have a look around the camp in search of familiar faces from Vizima."
 "As a Scoia'tael, Iorveth was quite experienced in finding hidden passages. He did not have to search for long - a path through a cave led straight to Loc Muinne. The witcher followed the elf underground."
 "Thanks to Iorveth's talent at sneaking unnoticed, our heroes got behind Loc Muinne city walls and started looking for Philippa Eilhart."
 "By a stroke of luck our heroes met Temerian soldiers discussing the sorceress they sought. Waiting in hiding, Geralt and Iorveth overheard that Philippa had been imprisoned. Luckily, an elven sewage system stretched under the city and even connected to the dungeon. Our spies split up - Iorveth went to search the sorceress' house, while Geralt headed into the sewers. The witcher wasn't looking forward to trudging through sewers again and seriously considered surrendering to a patrol to get into the prison that way."
 "And so, not for the first time in his career, Geralt entered sewers once more. This time, however, he was not hunting a dangerous monster, but was trying to reach a dangerous, but at the moment imprisoned, sorceress."
 "The witcher finally reached Philippa, but did not expect to see what he did. Fitz-Oesterlen and Radovid were present in the cell, and the king was taking revenge on the sorceress for years of humiliation he suffered as a powerless, underage heir at her, a powerful regent's, hands. Radovid had Philippa's eyes put out and tormented her in a way not becoming anyone, especially of a king. When the tormentor left, Geralt saw his chance. He revealed himself to press Shilard for information about Triss."
 "You should have seen Fitz-Oesterlen's face when he saw Geralt. Shilard would not be more surprised if the Nilfgaardian Emperor suddenly jumped out of a corner and kicked him in the arse. I heard he was white as a ghost and looked for a way out, but there was no escape from the witcher's wrath."
 "However Fitz-Oesterlen was too valuable a prize for Geralt to simply kill him. The emissary was, after all, his only way to the imprisoned Triss. The witcher faced a tough choice: he could free the wounded Philippa and look out for her, or carry the stunned Fitz-Oesterlen to get Triss."

An Encrypted Manuscript

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
An Encrypted Manuscript is a quest in Chapter III of "".
Walkthrough.
This quest begins when you find an Ancient manuscript in a chest in the southeastern rune room during the quest The Gargoyle Contract.
The text of the manuscript actually contains reads:
GUR SNZVYL BS QNFUJBBQ UNQ YBAT ORRA FRGGYRQ VA FHFFRK. GURVE RFGNGR JNF YNETR, NAQ GURVE ERFVQRAPR JNF NG ABEYNAQ CNEX, VA GUR PRAGER BS GURVE CEBCREGL, JURER, SBE ZNAL TRARENGVBAF, GURL UNQ YVIRQ VA FB ERFCRPGNOYR N ZNAARE NF GB RATNTR GUR TRARENY TBBQ BCVAVBA BS GURVE FHEEBHAQVAT NPDHNVAGNAPR.

Employing the ROT13 Caesar cipher to this (i.e. each letter is replaced by the one 13 places further on in the alphabet, so that A becomes N and B becomes O etc.) reveals the cleartext to be
THE FAMILY OF DASHWOOD HAD LONG BEEN SETTLED IN SUSSEX. THEIR ESTATE WAS LARGE, AND THEIR RESIDENCE WAS AT NORLAND PARK, IN THE CENTRE OF THEIR PROPERTY, WHERE, FOR MANY GENERATIONS, THEY HAD LIVED IN SO RESPECTABLE A MANNER AS TO ENGAGE THE GENERAL GOOD OPINION OF THEIR SURROUNDING ACQUAINTANCE. THE LATE OWNER OF THIS ESTATE WAS A SINGLE MAN, WHO LIVED TO A VERY ADVANCED AGE, AND WHO FOR MANY YEARS OF HIS LIFE, HAD A CONSTANT COMPANION AND HOUSEKEEPER IN HIS SISTER.
which is actually the first three sentences of the book Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen, admittedly not much related to the Witcher world.
Taking it to Bras of Ban Ard will reveal that the following items are needed to complete this quest:
There are bullvores and rotfiends in the sewers beneath Loc Muinne, and harpies on a ledge, but you would be well prepared to have all these items prior to finishing Chapter II, especially the nekker blood and the pheromones (Do not sell those items or accidentally use them in Alchemy). Although if you do not have the items, in the quest Lilies and Vipers when you are escorting Brigida there is a cave that you can venture into. In the cave are nekkers where you can get the blood and there is a path to the east which leads back outside. In the clearing outside are three endrega egg sacs (which resemble large rocks you can open). Upon destroying these a queen will appear and you can get the pheromones which will enable you to complete this quest. If you are on Iorveth's path, you can find a Queen Endreaga in the sewers while following The Secrets of Loc Miunne quest, available only on Iorveth's path. Nekkers do not appear here, though, so make sure you have some Warrior Nekker's blood left.
Return to Bras with the items, and he will discover that the book contains the , which he gives to Geralt.
 "In one of the ruined passages in Loc Muinne, Geralt found a manuscript written in a strange language. He could not understand a thing of it, so he decided to find a professional who would help him decipher the document."
 "This professional was Bras of Ban Ard, a sorcerer enamored of antiques. He decided that the book is encrypted with a spell, but that it could be broken. He needed ingredients for the counter spell: the pheromones of an endrega queen, the blood of a nekker warrior, the brain of a bullvore (a rare thing!) and a harpy egg, though a rotfiend's rongue would serve as a cheap substitute for the egg. With no other choice, the witcher started looking for the ingredients."
 "And his effort was rewarded. Bras used the ingredients and cast a decoding spell. He revealed that the book contained for creating a powerful sword named Caerme. Bars [] knew a thing or two about weapons and was a sorcerer on top of that. He was able to prepare the blade for the witcher!"
Journal entry.
Quest fails if Geralt follows Triss along to A Summit of Mages:
 "Geralt never learned the contents of the manuscript, however. When the sorcerers started dying at Loc Muinne, they had no time or inclination to study the wisdom of treaties."
Notes.
If you have accidentally used the above items, you can use either of the following mods to add the items to a near merchant for purchase:

The Gargoyle Contract is the only contract quest in Chapter III of "". It is available on both Iorveth's and Roche's paths in Loc Muinne.
 Gargoyle Contract
 "Let it be known far and wide that the sorcerers gathered in Loc Muinne seek a brave soul to rid the city of gargoyles. These beings pose a threat to the guests arriving for the summit, therefore they must be removed by any means possible. The person or persons who successfully fulfill this contract will be rewarded by the venerable Bras of Ban Ard and receive the gratitude of the Brotherhood."
Walkthrough.
Gargoyles are among the first monsters Geralt encounters as he enters Loc Muinne. They are all around the city, posted as guards and bound by magical seals which are in underground chambers, or "rune rooms". In order to get rid of the gargoyles once and for all, Geralt must deactivate each of the three seals by solving the rune puzzles in the underground chambers.
Reading the correct volumes (The Runes of Power I, The Runes of Power II, The Runes of Power III and The Runes of Power IV) will give him the information necessary to deactivate the seals in these chambers. Note that you do not need to buy the books in game, so long as you can extinguish the runes in the correct order.
Merely killing the gargoyles is not sufficient to fulfill the contract, the seals must be deactivated as well.
So you don't need to buy the books and only have to read the notice present in the rooms, refer to this table:
"Due to attacks by gargoyles living in the ruins, not many were willing to attend the Loc Muinne summit. The problem became serious enough that the sorcerers decided to hire a witcher. Luckily our hero was at hand. Geralt, as always, decided to learn more about the monsters through fighting them and reading learned tomes."
"The witcher learned that gargoyles are magical creatures, posted as the city guards. They attacked anyone who entered an area protected by the spell. Finding and deactivating the magical seals that bound the gargoyles would be enough to solve the problem. Armed with a sharp sword and knowledge, the witcher started looking for the seals."
"Geralt wore down the soles of his shoes and blunted his blade, but he got rid of the gargoyles. His reward waited in the hands of Bras of Ban Ard."
"Bras of Ban Ard turned out to be a generous employer. The Witcher was pleased."

The Harpy Contract is one of three possible contract quests in Chapter II of "".
 Harpy Contract
 "Hear ye, hear ye - good folk of Vergen and all visitors! Since so many intrepid swords and champions of so many causes have gathered in Vergen, perhaps one would perform a public service by going to the harpy lair and exterminating the creatures once and for all? I promise a hefty reward and eternal glory as a monster slayer."
 "Regards,Cecil Burdon, Alderman"
Walkthrough.
You can get this quest from the notice on the bulletin board next to the The Cauldron inn. It is helpful, but not necessary, to have read the book Harpies - Daughters of the Gale, which can be obtained in Chapter II from Felicia Cori at the market, after the gates are opened. Note that you may have this book already, as it can be obtained in Chapter I. After that, you will need harpy traps which you can get from Haggard, the blacksmith's apprentice, Earso, Thorak, or ask any crafter to craft them for you. You will need seven traps in total.
Arm one near a harpy and let the harpy grab it and bring it to a nest, which will destroy it. A message will appear onscreen if the nest is successfully destroyed. Don't arm two traps at the same time, wait until you've received credit for destroying a nest or you will risk wasting a trap. Be careful where you place the traps; they can be lost due to them being wedged against rocks, impeding the harpies from picking them up. Place them in an open area.
You can find four of the nests in the old quarry area. After finding those, you will need to continue the Hunting Magic quest in order to reach the other three nests which are behind the locked door at the south end of the old quarry. The locations of last three nests are as follows:
 "While in Upper Aedirn, Geralt was on the lookout for witcher's work. When he learned that Vergen's authorities had posted a bounty for thinning the local harpy population, he applied for the job. First he decided to learn more about the winged creatures' habits, either by exterminating them one by one or by reading professional literature about them."
 "The harpies nested on inaccessible rocky ledges. Geralt could not climb to their abodes, so he reasoned that some witcher technology might prove useful. He decided to use harpy traps, and so he did."
 "Most of the harpy nests were destroyed. Many years passed before the creatures' population rose anew. Geralt, proud as a peacock, went to see Cecil Burdon about his reward."
 "Cecil Burdon was not one a miserly sort of dwarf. The witcher got his reward for the harpy extermination and left pleased."

Vergen Besieged

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
Vergen Besieged is a quest in Chapter 2 of "".
Walkthrough.
This quest automatically begins after you lift the curse, all the shops and craftsmen become unavailable so it is advisable to finish up last minute shopping and crafting before going into the mist the last time. You begin in Philippa's quarters and you need to go talk to Zoltan at the front gate of Vergen. If you spared the trolls' lives, they will appear to help you defend Vergen (although it does not affect the outcome nor do you have more than the most fleeting opportunity to see the trolls in action) After a short cutscene you are given the task to open the hot oil valves. Go up the stairs and go straight for the mechanism between the second and third oil reserves. The enemies that are here never run out so don't bother clearing them out.
After another cutscene retreat to the second gate and defend the walls. Several waves of soldiers climb up the wall. They don't put up much of a fight since you will have allies to distract them. After finishing off the enemies follow Saskia down to the mines. Kill three mercenaries in the first room, another four mercenaries in the next room, three rotfiends, then after a cutscene you are faced with six soldiers and a mage. The mage can teleport around the battlefield and can cast Quen II and lightning. You can leave the soldiers to Saskia and focus on the mage. When you get the mage's life to less than half another cutscene will happen where you learn something about Saskia.
Afterwards go back to the walls. Follow Zoltan as he closes the gate. Then defend the walls again in exactly the same fashion as before. Another cutscene completes the battle.
Following the battle, Henselt surrenders and negotiates with Saskia.
Geralt and Iorveth can follow Philippa, but she eludes them in the end, taking Saskia with her.
 "Geralt awoke in Philippa Eilhart's quarters right in time. Henselt's forces were approaching Vergen to besiege the town. There were precious few heroes who could tilt the battle in Saskia's favor around, so the witcher had no other choice but to get out of bed and take matters in his own hands. Zoltan Chivay awaited him at the gate."
 "And so the assault began. The very first wave of attackers could destroy the barricade and break through into Vergen proper. To weaken their resolve, Geralt and Zoltan decided to activate an old dwarven mechanism and pour boiling oil on the attackers. Zoltan ran for the cauldrons on the left, and Geralt hastened to the lever on the right side of the walls."
 "With the skill of a consummate engineer, the witcher activated the mechanism on the walls, and boiling oil rained down on the enemy. This would not stop the Kaedwenis completely, but it did thin their numbers and weaken their resolve. The deed done, Geralt raced back to the defenders. Zoltan was waiting for him near the gate."
 "If only conventional weapons were used during the battle, the attackers would be in for it. But there was a sorcerer on their side. Dethmold blasted the barricade to bits with his spells, the Kaedweni attacked, and the Aedirnians had to retreat."
 "In a bold move, Henselt's soldiers attacked the walls. Geralt was in the first line, to repel them."
 "The witcher didn't have a moment for respite. A second assault came after the first one, and he had to stand firm on his station once more."
 "Henselt has been slapped on the wrist and was licking his wounds. However, that which could not be taken directly could be taken using guile. A secret passage was leading to Vergen, and Saskia was afraid the enemy might find it. Geralt ran to check out the underground corridor."
 "Accompanied by Saskia, Geralt descended into the secret Tunnels of the Founders. The defenders suspected that the enemy could use the corridors to launch a treacherous attack from behind. Their suspicions proved correct, for the expedition first encountered Kaedweni soldiers, and then Dethmold himself, led by a Vergeni traitor. Geralt could not let this opportunity pass and lunged at the sorcerer, sword in hand."
 "Yet Dethmold was no fool and would not stand by idly to be sliced by the witcher's blade. He fell back to a safe position and attacked Geralt with a spell so malignant that our hero's vision grew dark. Defeated, the witcher fell to the ground. The dwarven corridors would have been his grave if not for Saskia. The Dragonslayer shape shifted, transforming into a dragon, and lunged at Dethmold, causing him to flee. Thus, the witcher learned Saskia's secret. Suddenly, the many vague elements of her story began to make sense. It was clear it had been made up from the start. The Dragonslayer, being a dragon herself, had used the story to shape her image as a fighter for a free Pontar Valley, and to hide from humans her rather inconvenient true form. The witcher, who had miraculously survived, had little time to analyze matters in detail. He had to return to the walls and save Vergen!"
 "In the meantime, the Kaedweni mounted a third assault, putting all their forces on the attack. Geralt realized the defenders won't hold for long, but he was determined to fight to the bitter end."
 "Just as defeat loomed inevitably over the defenders, Iorveth returned to Vergen, leading reinforcements with him. The unexpected relief bolstered Saskia's soldiers and they began to cheer. Geralt was as happy as the next man, but he controlled his euphoria. He instantly realized that a great opportunity would be wasted unless he broke through to the elven leader and joined forces with him."
 "Geralt and Zoltan reached Iorveth. Now, to trap the Kaedwenis in the town courtyard, they needed to close the gate. To unblock the gate mechanism, the dwarf had to hit the lever with all the strength he could muster."
 "Closing the gate reversed the course of the battle. The Aedirnians found new strength, putting Henselt on the defensive and finally forcing him to surrender. Thus ended the war of Upper Aedirn."
 "The negotiations with Henselt came to an end. The Aedirnian victory was sealed. Yet, instead of celebrating the victory, Philippa and Saskia left in a hurry, without giving an explanation. If you suspect that they had reasons for such behavior, you're right. If you also think that the witcher managed to meet them before the left Vergen, you're also correct. Geralt and Iorveth followed them."
 "Philippa and Saskia disappeared in a portal without a word of explanation. Geralt decided to search Philippa's quarters, hoping he would find any clues."
 "While searching Philippa Eilhart's quarters, Geralt and Iorveth found a book tellingly titled "Venoms and Poisons". It was dog-eared at a page describing a poison allowing one to control another's mind. This was not irrefutable evidence, but it did cause certain suspicions that had been forming in our her's mind to sprout like beanstalks that wrap around poles in Dol Blathanna. Philippa had not only feigned being the Dragonslayer's friend. While treating her, she had poured her own venom into Saskia, a venom that affected the mind, not the body. In brief, the sorceress had taken control of the dragon's mind. Knowing Philippa, Geralt knew that Lady Eilhart would not hesitate to use her new weapon. So the witcher and Iorveth conferred and agreed to save Saskia."
 "Among Philippa Eilhart's abandoned possessions, Geralt learned a shocking truth. It turned out it was the sorceress that poisoned the Dragonslayer! Our hero had no idea what caused her to do so. But he guessed his finding was a trail of a bigger intrigue and saw all the previous mysteries in a new light. Vergen was triumphant, yet unaware of the heroic Saskia's disappearance, and Geralt and Iorveth began their search. The witcher was entering the final chapter of the story of the assassins of kings."
