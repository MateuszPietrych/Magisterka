Vesna Hood is a character in "The Witcher 1", who is a waitress at the Outskirts Inn.
Biography.
Vesna Hood works at the Outskirts Inn as a waitress. She lives with her grandmother at a village not far from Vizima's Maribor Gate.
In Chapter 1 of "The Witcher 1", she meets Geralt, and is later saved by Geralt from some bandits. Geralt can choose to escort Vesna home. (If Geralt let her go home alone, she will eventually get killed by monsters.)
After the successful escorting, Vesna can be a potential romance option for Geralt.
Romance card.
After successfully completing her escort quest, Geralt can suggest another meeting. Vesna, not wanting to "shock" her grandmother, recommends the old mill and plans to bring food, making wine the witcher's responsibility. Vesna will be waiting just outside the old mill every day from 19:30 onward, and will leave at 23:00. If you get her home before 22:01 during the escort, she will proceed to the mill instead of going inside. Otherwise she will appear and leave instantaneously and will not walk from or to her grandmother's house.
If you remember the wine (any medium alcohol is sufficient; if you fail to give her a proper drink twice she will give you a hint on what she wants and where to get it), Vesna will have enough liquid courage to brave the "haunted" mill, and the two of you head inside for what sounds like a vigorously good time while the neighbours across the river wax superstitious.
Note: As stated above Vesna will be waiting every night until you meet her, however there is a point in the game where she will no longer wait for you at the appointed time. If you turn in both The Salamander's Tail's "Trust gained", as well as Of Monsters and Men's "Alvin's Prophecy" stages prior to meeting with her you will lose your chance of receiving her Romance card. Turning in either stage is fine, however due to the nature of both quests it is easy to accidentally turn in both at the same time in the same dialog, locking you out of the option (outside prior saves of course). It is therefore advised to meet with her prior to turning in either stage.
"A barmaid from the tavern in the Outskirts, Vesna is quite a determined girl. She sells food and alcohol."

Haren Brogg was a local merchant and dice poker enthusiast who lived in the fishing village in the Outskirts. His demeanour changed to suit the occasion, so the first impression of him was not one which inspired much trust. Since the of the game, he also now stuttered.
He appeared to have dealings with hawkers, but the exact nature of the dealings was unclear. Is he a hawker? It was also possible that he had sold out Squirrels for gold.
He also recognized Zoltan Chivay's name.
"Haren Brogg is a suspicious character who fears only the Reverend. He sneers at the law and surrounds himself with thugs who protect his shady dealings."
"Brogg lives in the Outskirts, in a little lakeside settlement that he rules outright. He never strays far from his home. Brogg runs a store trading in weapons and alchemical ingredients used to produce bombs."

Leo was one of the many young orphans of the Second Nilfgaard War. Vesemir took him under his wing at Kaer Morhen and began training him as a witcher around the year 1264. Leo was not a full witcher, as he had not undergone the mutations, but he was intent on working on his craft. He was eager and seemed to want to be a witcher.
Biography.
Early Life.
Leo was one of the orphans of the war that was found by Vesemir and started training to become a witcher around the year 1264. As part of this, while he was not mutated, according to Eskel he did go through with the Choice trial. Vesemir also had Leo train with both Eskel and Lambert as he grew up. One instance of the former was witnessed around six years later by Geralt after his return and Leo himself mentioned training with Lambert, who was said to always beat the boy but encourage him on his potential each time after he did.
A few days after the return of Geralt, Salamandra attacked Kaer Morhen. Towards the end of the battle, Leo was fatally shot by the Professor and died in Geralt's arms.
He was later buried near the keep, along the Gwenllech River's bank.
"Leo is the youngest of Kaer Morhen's residents. He's not a full witcher — though he has completed his training, he was not subjected to mutation. Leo comes across as a hot-headed whelp, but is also kind-hearted and good."
"It appears that Leo is somewhat fascinated with me. He has heard the ballads about the White Wolf and now holds me in high regard."
"Leo was killed by the Professor, one of the leaders of the assault on Kaer Morhen. The boy was too hasty and inexperienced. I wasn't able to help him, even though I was right beside him."
"I saw Leo's face again — this time on a specter. It reminded me that I failed in the cellars of Kaer Morhen."
Journal entry.
In "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", he was mentioned in conversations with other characters, such as one with Vesemir. He also had a cenotaph to the south of Kaer Morhen. Upon its discovery, Geralt will have said: "Leo's grave... A senseless death, could've been avoided."

Abigail was a witch who lived in her house in the outskirts of Vizima. She was not well-liked by the villagers and was blamed for many bad or strange occurrences. Her main skill was alchemy, so though the villagers approached her with suspicion, they also relied on her for potions and poisons - which she provided, rarely bothering with questions or moral objections.
In the course of Chapter I, Abigail took in the orphaned Alvin after Geralt saved him from the barghests as Shani could not care for him from an inn. She also facilitated a trance where the boy revealed more about the beast and its minions who were plaguing the village.
Geralt can buy a blade coating formula from her that makes it easier to battle specters and ghosts. In fact, she buys and sells quite a few things:
If her fate was left to the villagers, she cursed Geralt in the name of the Lionhead Spider, which she called the Black Legba. Whether this meant she was also responsible for the misdeeds of the other villagers is unclear.
"A witch named Abigail lives in a village in the Outskirts. Though the villagers buy herbs and potions from her, she also faces much hostility."
if Geralt saves Abigail from the mob:
"The Reverend informed the congregation that Abigail had uttered the Curse of the Hellhound and the witch was surrounded by an angry mob. I decided that she did not deserve to die, and saved her from being lynched. Abigail left the Outskirts for good."
"I met Abigail again in the village of Murky Waters. The witch still trades in herbs and potions."
if Geralt leaves Abigail to be lynched:
"The Reverend informed the congregation that Abigail had uttered the Curse of the Hellhound and the witch was surrounded by an angry mob. I decided not to interfere in the shadowy internal affairs of the Outskirts. The witch was burned at the stake just after I left."

The Reverend (Polish: "Wielebny") is a paranoid man who is the religious leader of the people that live in the Outskirts of Vizima. Despite his religious designation, he seems to run the Outskirts. He leads the people against the witch Abigail, blaming her for the appearance of "the Beast", a hellhound.
The Reverend can usually be found praying in the small courtyard in front of the Church, or in his house, next door. He will gladly pontificate on the sins of others and the righteousness of the Eternal Fire.
"The leader of the community in the Outskirts is a domineering priest of the Eternal Fire called the Reverend. His authority reaches well beyond the realm of the spiritual — people from the town and village in the Outskirts do exactly what he says. The Reverend is a religious fanatic and a hypocrite. He easily finds guilt where it doesn't exist, ignoring real offences."
"The Reverend lives in the town, just left of the temple. During the day he either prays or tends to the church."
"The witch Abigail was probably gone by the time I arrived at the Reverend's. Irreconcilable differences is all I can call it. We argued and I had to kill the priest."
"The escalating conflict between the Reverend and the local soothsayer ended grimly. A lynch mob accused Abigail of summoning the Beast and then burned her at the stake."
"After tending to the witch Abigail, the Reverend unleashed his congregation on me. I had to kill the priest."

Siegfried of Denesle was the 2nd Grandmaster of the Order of the Flaming Rose, serving from September 1270 to 1272.
As a young knight, Siegfried joined the brotherhood to fight against monsters and generally anything evil that might endanger the common folk. Since he was also a nobleman of some moral code and kind heart, Siegfried got along rather well with the witcher Geralt of Rivia and their friendship changed his life forever.
Biography.
Early life.
Siegfried was born sometime in the 1250s to pious Sir Eyck of Denesle and his wife Sophia. His parents raised him at Castle Denesle, teaching him knightly code of honor.
At one point, a serious illness struck Siegfried's mother. He immediately ran to his father and implored him to earn coin for her betterment by demanding payment for next few beasts he would slay. Eyck, however, refused so as to not stain his reputation. This angered Siegfried so much that he renounced his father.
Later, when he joined the Order, a rumor began to circulate in the Trade Quarter of Vizima claiming he was secretly a bastard of Jacques de Aldersberg.
Events in Vizima and uprising.
Siegfried first met Geralt in the Vizima sewers while they were both on the hunt for a dangerous cockatrice. The knight suggested that they join forces to defeat the beast and deal with drowners. After the cockatrice was slain, both Geralt and Siegfried were ambushed on their way to the surface by Salamandra agents. After these were defeated, Siegfried sarcastically asked whether they were friends of the witcher's, then on a more sober note mentioned a friend who might be of service in defeating this organization: Raymond Maarloeve, a private detective living in the Temple Quarter just above the sewers.
Siegfried then spent most of the following days at his post (if he and Geralt joined forces in the sewers, this is the Order outpost north of the Cloister; if not, it is at the front entrance to St. Lebioda's Hospital), at one point making a brief excursion to the swamp - but first, he waited by the gate to the dike in order to help Geralt past its guards. He could also be invited to Shani's party. Later on, he was moved before the Cloister's main entrance and advised Geralt on a couple of happenings.
" If Geralt has consistently supported the Order:" Siegfried became a key ally to Geralt and started realizing that Jacques de Aldersberg is descending down a path of madness with mutated Greater brothers and other similar monstrosities designed to defeat both the Scoia'tael under Yaevinn and forces loyal to King Foltest.
" If Geralt has consistently supported the Scoia'tael:" Siegfried became yet another fanatic who blindingly believed in words of the Grand Master and considered the witcher to be traitor, becoming his sworn enemy.
Moving the Order to Redania and Loc Muinne.
After the death of Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg, the Order "de facto" lost its ground in Temeria and parts of Aedirn. The Order's Supreme Council convened not long after and Siegfried was chosen as the next Grand Master. The assembly also accepted King Radovid V's proposal to become a special force of Redania and moved to that kingdom's northern parts where they began to build Castle Barienmurg, the main stronghold of territories granted to them as well as one of the largest fortifications in the Northern Kingdoms.
At this point, Siegfried still continued his monster hunting but due to an overload of work, he has done so sporadically. When summit of monarchs and mages was being prepared at Loc Muinne in July 1271, Radovid summoned Siegfried and his knights to oversee the security.
"Iorweth's path:" Siegfried stepped in to allow Geralt safe passage into Loc Muinne through the Order's Camp, though Iorweth nevertheless had to find an alternate route.
"Roche's path:" Siegfried vouched for both Geralt and Vernon Roche when entering Loc Muinne and meeting Radovid. Siegfried believed in Geralt's innocence regardless of the path the witcher has taken and also stated he owes Geralt too much to stand against him as well as talking about Radovid's ambition, the reformation of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and the Order's view on peasant rebellions.
" If Geralt decides to help Roche and then give Anais La Valette to Jan Natalis:" Siegfried allowed them to depart in peace as opposed to ordering the Order's Knights to fight them.
"If Geralt decides to give Anais to Radovid:" He and his knights escorted them While Siegfried made a remark about how the Redanian colors would suit Roche.
"Siegfried of Denesle, a knight of the Order of the Flaming Rose, is an idealist who adheres to the Order's rules but is not devoid of common sense. Polite and open, he is unlike many of his brothers from the Order in that he is not prejudiced. He is undeniably courageous and demonstrated this when he descended alone into the sewers to fight the cockatrice."
"Siegfried and I defeated the cockatrice together. The knight proved both polite and a skilled swordsman."
"I have a feeling Siegfried is starting to see through his own misapprehensions. He has realized that killing monsters will not eliminate all the evil of this world, and his duties towards the Order sometimes force him to choose the greater of two evils."
"During the bank robbery in the Trade Quarter, I opposed Yaevinn and his forces together with Siegfried. The attack reinforced the knight's conviction that the Order's dislike of non-humans is justified."
"I asked Siegfried for military support during the assault on Salamandra's headquarters in Vizima. The knight, who was among those invited to Leuvaarden's party, agreed to help me break up the organization."
if Geralt does not side with Yaevinn in Force Recon:
"The knights led by Siegfried defeated the Scoia'tael during the clash in the Golem Burial Ground."
if Geralt chooses the Order path:
"On the hill under the Old Manor, during the fight against Salamandra, my friend aided me again."
if Geralt chooses the neutral path and decides to kill Siegfried.:
"Siegfried of Denesle died by my hand when he stood between me and the Grand Master. He remained loyal to the Order of the Flaming Rose to the very end."
"The knightly caste should oblige its members to follow the path of honor, of certain rules and ideals. Unfortunately in our rotten times, many among the knighted, dismissive of the vows they made, are often more interested in their own privileges and chances to stuff their pouches. Compared to all those false knights, robber barons and other heraldic rabble, the House of Denesle stood apart like a lion among mongrels. Like his father Eyck of Denesle before him, the young Siegfried always followed strict moral rules in life and an iron code of honor, to the point that his devotion sometimes bordered on fanaticism. During our last meeting, Siegfried had served in the ranks of the Order of the Flaming Rose, and he played no small part in the events at that time in the capital of Temeria."
If Geralt chose the Order in the first game:
"It was because of those past times that Siegfried made no objections and allowed Geralt to enter Loc Muinne."
If Geralt decides to give Anais to John Natalis:
"Their friendship proved its worth for a second time when Geralt and Roche faced a patrol sent to bring Anais La Valette under Radovid's protective wing. Because the Temerian and the witcher's interests differed from the king's, bloodshed seemed inevitable – yet, remembering their friendship, the knight of Denesle conveniently "forgot" that he saw them in the Kaedweni camp."

Bernard Ducat, better known as Thaler, was a master spy and the former head of Temeria's Intelligence Service during the 1270s.
Biography.
Sometime prior to 1270, Thaler was already the head of Temerian Intelligence, where he helped with various spy activities as well as more unusual tasks, such as sending some of his men out to hunt down catoblepas for their meat, as it was Adda the White's favorite dish.
During this time a young Shani happened to be in Vizima and, taking a liking to her, Thaler asked her out, but hid who he really was. However, one night while they wandered the city, Shani noticed two spies following them and eventually the inept men accidentally revealed that Thaler was, in fact, the head of Temerian Intelligence, ending their short relationship.
Meeting Geralt.
Eventually in 1270, Thaler began to pose as a fence in the city to gather intel and was visited by Coleman, who sold him some witcher equipment he'd found. Thaler eventually sold this off to the guards, not realizing it'd soon lead to him crossing paths with the witcher Geralt, who was also looking for the owner of the sword. During this time, King Foltest also left the city for a bit and personally put Thaler in charge while he was away.
Shortly after, Geralt visited and, after Thaler revealed what he knew about Berengar, the two parted ways only to meet up again later during an important reception for high class society. However, this time Thaler was now using his real identity, Bernard, and revealed to Geralt who he really was. He eventually asked a favor for a favor and had Geralt retrieve a mysterious letter, not revealing he believed someone was forging documents as Foltest. With the newest letter in hand though he was finally able to confirm it, as the letter was supposedly from Foltest stripping Thaler of his position as chief but was missing the king's signature.
As the party winded down, Thaler went outside but soon got into an argument with Roderick de Wett, and while the count remarked Thaler was just mad about being fired, Thaler noted de Wett knew more than he was letting on.
"If Geralt defends Thaler:" Thanks to the witcher stepping in, Thaler was saved from being killed by de Wett and his men. He then asked Geralt to meet him back in the inn to talk and Thaler revealed all the evidence he'd gathered on the forged documents.
"If Geralt kills him or walks away:" With no one else to protect him and outnumbered, Thaler was quickly killed. "Game continuation:" Note that this is one of the few times in the games where your choice has no effect and Thaler will appear alive in the third game, even if killed here and you imported saves all the way through.
Third Nilfgaardian War.
After Nilfgaard invaded Temeria in late 1271, they quickly dismantled the kingdom's secret service and Thaler barely escaped with his life. Not knowing what else to do, he proceeded to drink away his sorrows until his "liver screamed bloody murder" then decided he had to do something about the situation. Shortly thereafter he got into contact with Vernon Roche and Sigismund Dijkstra and the three decided something extremely drastic had to be done: King Radovid V of Redania had to die.
Using his experience as Temeria's former spymaster, he began to recruit new spies and took on the role of a traveling cobbler by the name of Clogs, noting that cobblers didn't attract any attention while still being able to see and hear all the people around them while they worked. Beginning plans for Radovid's murder, he planned to meet up with one of his co-conspirators, though was left waiting. He travelled to White Orchard, and used an old lady living on the Ismena's hut and pan-soot to write letters to them, forgetting his monocle in the process.
" If Geralt takes part in A Deadly Plot:" While relatively safe from being harassed by soldiers, Thaler found himself instead attacked by a group of rock trolls who wanted shoes of their own. Geralt eventually found and extracted Thaler from them and Thaler made it safely to the Seven Cats Inn.
" If Geralt takes part in Reason of State:" He later met up with his co-conspirators to tell them of the information they'd been waiting to hear about and included Geralt in on their plans, who was needed to lure Radovid off his ship and into an ambush. As Thaler and Dijkstra weren't very adept fighters like Geralt, Vernon, and Ves, he and Dijkstra remained at the butcher's yard in Novigrad to wait on the outcome of the attempted assassination.
"If Geralt protects the Temerian patriots:" Thanks to Geralt, Thaler survived Dijkstra's betrayal and was able to continue negotiations with Nilfgaard for Temeria to become a vassal state to the Empire and made plans to return to Vizima once Emhyr cleared out.
"If Geralt lets Dijkstra kill the Temerian patriots:" Unfortunately Thaler didn't foresee Redania's former spymaster turning on them and was subsequently killed with Vernon and Ves.
"The Witcher".
During Chapter II, Thaler can be found in his house and sometimes walking around through the streets of the Temple Quarter. His house doubles as his shop, in the southeastern section of the Temple Quarter, just around the corner from the dungeon. There he can be called upon to buy and sell a variety of goods. He also plays dice and offers a quiet drinking atmosphere and a free place to stay.
Thaler will buy and sell:
"In the Temple Quarter of Vizima lives a fence named Thaler. He has many things that belonged to Berengar, and also deals in illegal goods. The fence is a repulsive man and uses particularly foul language."
"During the day he can be found in his store, which is located in a house in the Temple Quarter."
"Thaler put Berengar's witcher equipment up for sale. I wonder how he acquired these things."
"The fence's circle of influence is really wide. It also includes city guards."
"For a fence and a thug Thaler has surprisingly extensive contracts, not only with thieves, but also among the affluent."
"There was a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting that Thaler was working for Salamandra, yet he proved to be innocent."
"To my surprise Thaler the fence was invited to Leuvaarden's reception, at which only the rich and influential were present."
"It turned out that Thaler is the chief of Temerian intelligence and his fence guise is simply one of many assumed personalities."
If Geralt stays neutral when Count de Wett and Thaler are in the courtyard:
"When Count de Wett accused Thaler of treason, I did not object. The former head of Temeria's Intelligence Service was summarily executed."
If Geralt defends Thaler from Count de Wett in the courtyard:
"Thaler is interested in the political situation in Vizima. He's also investigating an important case involving forgeries."
not actually in the game:
"I met Thaler again in the chambers of the royal castle. Foltest seems to be satisfied with the doings of his master spy, and Thaler is pleased with our collaboration."
 "Geralt was not expecting to meet Bernard Ducat, former head of Temerian intelligence, in such circumstances. Their relationship went back a long ways, to the time when Ducat was leading an espionage operation in the Vizima Temple District disguised as a fence named Thaler. Thaler the fence was known for his gruff manners and extremely filthy tongue."
 "Much had changed since those days, but Clogs the cobbler (as Ducat now called himself) was as rude and vulgar as Thaler had ever been."
 "His exact role in the attack on Radovid was not clear, but considering his experience and professionalism, one could hardly expect him to share that information, not even with an old friend."
 "Spycraft leaves no margin for error, sentiment or dropping one's guard..."
 If Geralt chooses to intervene and fight Dijkstra:
 "...Thaler should have known this, but instead he left himself exposed and only escaped death thanks to Geralt's intervention, his life saved by the witcher's departure from his usual neutrality."
 If Geralt chooses to not intervene and lets Dijkstra kill Thaler:
 "...Thaler died in a violent bout of political maneuvering when it turned out his plans conflicted with the greater good of Redania."

Declan Leuvaarden is a rich merchant from Nilfgaard, and member of the Guild of Merchants whom Geralt met at an inn in the Outskirts. Leuvaarden seems a resourceful and wealthy man with extensive contacts.
He lives in the Trade Quarter of Vizima. In Chapter II during the day, he can be found on the dike, from where he runs his business. In Chapter III, his base of operations moves to the banquet facilities, upstairs at The New Narakort in the Trade Quarter.
"The Witcher".
He buys and sells:
He has apparently known Triss Merigold for some time and is very well connected in Viziman society. He is on close speaking terms with the burgomeister, Velerad, the chief of Temerian secret intelligence, Thaler, and the Princess herself, Adda.
Associated quests.
Declan is a major game character and plays a part in several quests.
"I met Declan Leuvaarden, a rich merchant from Nilfgaard, at an inn in the Outskirts. Leuvaarden seems a resourceful and wealthy man with extensive contacts. He lives in the Trade Quarter of Vizima. During the day he can be found on the Dike, from where he runs his business."
"Although Leuvaarden seemed to be working with Salamandra, he turned out to be innocent. But I still sense the Nilfgaardian has something to hide."
"It seems Leuvaarden belongs to a secret organization. He refused to reveal any details."
"Leuvaarden represents a secret organization euphemistically referred to as the Merchants' Guild. They wish to destroy Salamandra, because the bandits have become too powerful and threaten the Guild's interests. This is why Leuvaarden has aligned himself with Triss Merigold, who represents the sorceresses. I joined them to create a triumvirate, though I only represent myself."
"Not all his businesses are legal. He prefers to keep some of his deals very quiet."
"The city guards are used to receiving bribes from Leuvaarden, who clearly is not the city's most law-abiding resident."
"In the world of big finance, Declan Leuvaarden is in his element. He does business via banks and other middlemen, which makes tracing his transfers a very difficult task."

Vincent Meis was the head of the City Guard in Vizima and in charge of the Temple Quarter during 1270. While he had a wry sense of humor, he appeared to also be a fair man.
Biography.
Being the head of the City Guard, Vincent had an extensive network of contacts that included Thaler, Raymond Maarloeve, and Jethro, and could usually be found at his post near the dungeon. However, nobody knew where he ran off to during the night or what he was doing except Carmen, the local madam, and who Vincent was romantically involved with. That changed one night when Geralt discovered a werewolf murdering criminals in the city. The werewolf then spoke to the witcher, revealing that he was Vincent and that he ultimately saw his werewolf form as a way to get rid of crime in the city.
"If Geralt kills Vincent:" Vincent dies and Geralt will have no way to convince the city guards later on that he did it because Vincent was a werewolf, forcing him to fight them.
"If Geralt spares Vincent:" Vincent becomes a useful ally and later helps the witcher fight off some Salamandra attackers at The New Narakort inn.
"Additionally, if Geralt cures Vincent:" Vincent will marry Carmen.
"Vincent is the Captain of the City Guard and the main executor of the king's law in the Temple Quarter."
"It appears I've fallen into disfavor with the City Guard, or more to the point with Vincent himself. He thinks I'm hindering his attempts to break up Salamandra's network."
"The Captain of the City Guard released the Professor, one of the most wanted criminals of Temeria."
"On his orders the city guards are forbidden to talk about Salamandra."
"Vincent Meis was one of the few who knew that I was going into the sewers to kill the cockatrice and that I could only leave by the exit where I encountered the Salamandra bandits."
"The Captain of the City Guard is innocent. I have evidence to prove that he wasn't collaborating with Salamandra."
"Vincent is the Captain of the City Guard and the main executor of the king's law in the Temple Quarter."
"People say that it's impossible to get in touch with Meis at night. After dark, the captain vanishes into thin air."
If Geralt kills the werewolf:
"It turned out that Vincent Meis had a dark secret. The Captain of the City Guard is a lycanthrope. As a werewolf, he roamed the streets at night and fought criminals. I decided the monster was too big a threat to the people of the city and killed him."
If Geralt spares the werewolf:
"It turned out Vincent Meis had a dark secret. The Captain of the City Guard is a lycanthrope. As a werewolf he roams the streets and at night and fights crime. I decided that Vincent poses no threat to common folk and let him live, though he is in fact a monster."
Additionally, if Geralt decides to cure the werewolf:
"Carmen, a prostitute who is in love with Vincent, asked me to find a remedy for lycanthropy and I told her how to cure her beloved. Vincent is no longer a werewolf, so nothing stands in the way of his and Carmen's love."

Nurses

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
If Geralt chose the Witcher / Neutral path, he meets two nurses upon climbing down from the ramparts of Old Vizima after having fought his way from the Dike where he arrived. They are trying to reach the field hospital which has been setup by Shani, but can not make it unescorted through the fighting in the streets. They need the witcher's help.
"Note:" This entry is only possible to obtain by choosing the Witcher / Neutral path in the game.
Their romance card is available if you return to the Field hospital after escorting Shani to the Druids' cave in the Swamp cemetery. The front door will be locked after escorting Shani, so you'll have to use the other door. They're usually upstairs.
"Some women feel compelled to care for others, bring them relief from their suffering. They become nurses, priestesses and medics, treating the sick and wounded, providing comfort and hope to those in need."

Ha! Typically short sighted! Witcher, alchemy is the mother of all sciences, and do you know why? For it allows us to understand the world! All that surrounds us you is none other than the alchemy you strive so dutifully to deride! Alchemical processes transpire in your body at all times! They allow you to eat, breathe and excrete. What's more, they are responsible for your thoughts and feelings! Alchemy is life!- Kalkstein to Geralt, "The Witcher"
Adalbertus Aloysius Kalkstein (d. 1272) was a master alchemist, author, occasional armorer and honorary chairman of the Alchemists, Geomancers, and Pyromancers Club. While in Vizima, he owned a house in the nonhuman district of the Temple Quarter, right next door to Golan Vivaldi and just around the corner from Shani.
At some point, after a turmoil caused by the Order of the Flaming Rose and Scoia'tael, he moved into Novigrad where he lived his ordinary life until he was captured by witch hunters and subsequently burned at the stake.
Biography.
Early life.
Adalbertus Aloysius Kalkstein was a Master of Alchemy who, for the most of his life, inhabited a house in the non-human district of Vizima's Temple Quarter, in a neighborhood with dwarven banker Golan Vivaldi. However, at times, he would leave the city and travel to Oxenfurt where he would attend scientific discussions and convents.
Kalkstein was the author of many alchemical works, including a treatise called Transmutations and Metamorphoses analyzing attempts to animate inanimate matter, an activity otherwise known as constructing a golem. The alchemist has been interested in this matter for years but due to his convoluted style, his work was difficult to read.
Apart from being a very powerful alchemist, Kalkstein also knew a great deal about gnomish technology and elven mastery of crafting armor. To fund his researches and experiments, he ran a shop in his house and sold items related to alchemy such as books and scrolls, Ginatz's acid (15), white vinegar (20), Sulfur (30), Albar's crystals (40), a few talismans, like garlic and red ribbon, barghest skulls, wolf pelts, alp fangs. He also bought White Raffard's Decoction and Wives' Tears if someone offered him.
Geralt and Salamandra mystery.
Geralt and Kalkstein first met in the Outskirts where the state of quarantine was making it difficult for anyone to enter the city, and the alchemist was no exception. While Kalkstein waited to have his pass accepted, he bided his time at the local Inn.
The witcher immediately recognized that the alchemist was very interested in anything alchemical or unnatural. On his first encounter with the witcher, he asks if he can examine his body for scientific purposes. When Geralt took exception, he then relented and asked if he could perform an autopsy upon his death. This did not really go over well either so they changed the subject and never returned to such discussion.
Geralt met Kalkstein a second time at the Merchants' Gate, where he was threatened by Salamandra bandits who intended on taking his equipment, by force. After a quick round of swordplay, thugs were dispatched and a grateful alchemist offered Geralt a reward: his services anytime the witcher is in Vizima, at a discount. It was also at this point in his journey that Geralt realized the full extent of the repercussions of the theft of the Witchers' Secrets from Kaer Morhen and his resolve to track them down and make them pay is renewed.
Once Geralt got out of prison and took up his investigation of Salamandra, it did not take long before the name, "Kalkstein" cropped up again. Remembering that the alchemist's place of business was in the Temple Quarter, Geralt set to find it. From a shingle outside Kalkstein's house, he learned that the alchemist needed someone handy with a sword for his latest project. This seemed to be "the" project that excited him most: opening the mysterious mage's tower in the swamp. Prior to Geralt, he hired Berengar to look into it, but that witcher just disappeared.
During the autopsy portion of the investigation into the murder of the crown witness, the alchemist became one of the suspects. If Geralt believed that Kalkstein was involved with the organization, Azar Javed seized the opportunity presented by Geralt's false conclusions and further blackened Kalkstein's reputation with tales of his alleged involvement with the Salamandra. Only after a confrontation with the real culprit at the mage's tower did Geralt finally learn the truth.
Opening the tower and Viziman riots.
Once the tower has been opened, it became Kalkstein's main base of operations for a while. And fortunately for the witcher, there were no hard feelings if Geralt had implicated him earlier. Their relationship merely continued as normal. Of course, if the alchemist was not implicated, there was nothing to forgive, so it was business as usual.
Also in the tower, Kalkstein told Geralt about his new ground-breaking theory of invisible particles constituting matter, in constant movement and interacting with each other even though he can not go out with it yet as he does not have any good enough proof.
When the fight between the Jacques de Aldersberg's Order of the Flaming Rose and Yaevinn's Scoia'tael erupted, the alchemist moved with his laboratory to Old Vizima, where tales of Mutants and strigas roaming the streets have lured the curious scientist. If Geralt decided to stay neutral throughout the conflict, Kalkstein also became his armorer when it became necessary to fashion Raven's armor for the final battle.
Life in Novigrad and death.
After the events which transpired in Vizima, Kalkstein moved to Novigrad where he continued his alchemy workshop, earning his living selling potions and bombs. When Dandelion asked him for a substance strong enough to open Reuven's treasure vault, whose riches he needed to repay Cyprian Wiley, Kalkstein created a magical bomb from phosphorus and wyvern oil that stood up to a task.
Unfortunately, however, not long before Geralt's arrival in Novigrad, Kalkstein fell prey to Radovid V's witch hunts. He supposedly went out with a "bang". When he died on a pyre, fiery beasts surrounded him and shot into the air to form letters which spelled "Radovid sucks flaccid cock".
"The absent-minded alchemist seems nice, but it is obvious that scientific theories are of greater concern to him than the more prosaic aspects of life."
"He lives in the part of the Temple Quarter inhabited by non-humans. He runs an alchemy workshop there, earning his living selling potions. But he devotes himself to his greatest passion — gnomish alchemy."
"The alchemist sometimes uses the services of witchers. Berengar used to work for him."
"Kalkstein has dealings with Vizima's criminal underworld. Strange company for an alchemist to keep."
"I have proved that Kalkstein is not the Salamandra leader. I'm glad, because I've actually grown fond of the alchemist."
"For the first time since I arrived at Kaer Morhen, I saw a truly happy man. The door to the tower in the swamp stood wide open, and at the thought of all the alchemical secrets waiting inside, Kalkstein was as delirious as a drunken dwarf."
"Even though he calls himself a scientist, Kalkstein is an alchemist, so he definitely dabbles in magic."
"Kalkstein is the author of many alchemical works, including a treatise analysing attempts to animate inanimate matter, an activity known otherwise as constructing a golem. Apparently the alchemist has been interested in this matter for years. Kalkstein's convoluted style makes his work difficult to read."
"Riots and fires in the city drove Kalkstein from his laboratory. I met the alchemist in Old Vizima, to where he fled."

Azar Javed was a Zerrikanian alchemist and renegade sorcerer drawing Power from fire. Expelled from Ban Ard Academy, Javed went on to become an influential underworld figure leading the infamous Salamandra and its clandestine operations within the Northern Kingdoms.
After secretly allying with Grandmaster Jacques de Aldersberg, Javed ordered the storming of Kaer Morhen and stole the witcher mutagens. Having acquired them, he proceeded to create mutant soldiers for his benefactor. In the end, the Zerrikanian mage died in his second fight against Geralt of Rivia.
Biography.
Rogue mage.
Born in the lands of Zerrikania, Javed set off for the Northern Kingdoms at a young age to enter the prestigious Ban Ard Academy in Kaedwen. He used the services of the Vivaldi Bank to pay tuition. In Ban Ard, Javed strove to master the elemental powers of fire. Nevertheless he didn't finish the academy, his masters expelling him for an appalling interest in dark magic. This left the Zerrikanian as a renegade in foreign realms, though by this point he was already a formidable force.
In time, he would come to be the boss of his own criminal organization known as the Salamandra. The gang grew increasingly powerful in the underworld and Javed took in mage-rejects such as Savolla to continue their training. Eventually, the Salamandra reached an understanding with Novigrad's Syndicate too.
The Grand Plan.
Stealing witcher secrets.
Ambitious to a fault, Javed was at one point contacted by the founding Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, Jacques de Aldersberg, who revealed to him his "Grand Plan" to take over the North. First off, they needed an invincible warriors. Fortunately for Javed and de Aldersberg, Berengar, at the time fed up with his life as a monster slayer, uncovered the potential of witcher mutagens and formulas to them. Berengar also told Salamandra of a secret path that led to Kaer Morhen.
Not hesitating, the Zerrikanian mustered his forces, promising 50 oren reward to anyone who would manage to kill a witcher. One day shortly before Belleteyn of 1270, Javed ordered the assault. The Salamandra boss let Savolla and his frightener lead the charge, wasting no time and going straight for the witchers' laboratory alongside his second-in-command, the Professor. Triss Merigold attempted to stop them, but severely underestimated Javed who knocked her out and proceeded unharmed.
Upon entering the spacious underground, Javed found a Circle of Elements from which he drew power. Thus strengthened, he created an impenetrable barrier between the laboratory and the rest of the undergrounds to keep anyone from interrupting his search for witchers' secrets. Two of the School of the Wolf witchers, Geralt of Rivia and Leo, caught up with Javed and the Professor. Javed, having found what he came for, teleported away and left the portal open long enough for the Professor to follow.
Operating from Vizima.
After returning to Vizima, Javed used his extensive knowledge of mutation and alchemy to begin experiments, setting up his laboratory in the catacombs beneath the Old Manor. His ultimate goal was to create warriors who would posses extraordinary strength, endurance, agility and regeneration while at the same time being unquestioningly obedient to the Order of the Flaming Rose. When the Professor ended up in the dungeon, Javed had him bailed out. Later, Azar noticed that Geralt started working with detective Raymond Maarloeve which he already had history with, so he sent some assassins to scare Raymond and get him to hide for a while, sometime after that he killed the detective and used powerful illusion to assume Raymond's identity.
Disguised, he persuaded Geralt to go into the swamp outside the city and find a way to open the mage's tower there. When he had the witcher away, Javed tried to either get Kalkstein and Ramsmeat on Salamandra's side or remove any obstacle they could pose to his plans. Ramsmeat, however, survived the attackers Javed sent to slice his throat. During the briefings false Raymond had with Geralt, the Salamandra boss didn't much bother with keeping his disguise as Maarloeve outside the superficial appearance. Not only did he ask for payment, he kept a box of fisstech in his room, both of which the detective wouldn't. Satisfied with information gathered via investigation, Javed gave the witcher the last Sephirot needed to open the tower before they went to visit it.
"If Geralt figured out the ruse:" After Geralt exited the tower, Javed, still disguised as the detective, moved in for a surprise attack but Geralt revealed he knew the real Raymond had been killed and was therefore talking to Javed.
"If Geralt didn't figure out the ruse:" After Geralt exited the tower, Javed attacked, revealing to the witcher he had killed the detective earlier and taken his place.
The two then start to fight but since it was in the swamps where the damp environment weakened his fire powers, Javed called on the Professor for help and summoned two genies of fire, ifrits. They then jointly fought the witcher until the Professor managed to poison Geralt with manticore venom. After that, the mage and the assassin teleported away.
Much to Javed's chagrin, Triss Marigold nursed Geralt back to health and the witcher returned to his goal, destroying the Salamandra hideout in the sewers. Meanwhile, the Zerrikanian used the absence of King Foltest to seal a deal with ambitious Adda the White. Through her, Salamandra passed fake edicts in exchange for promise of assistance should the princess decide to dethrone her father. Javed tried to convince Radovid V of Redania to join the conspiracy as well, finance Salamandra, but that failed.
When Geralt located the underground Salamandra base, Javed came face to face with him again. Saying that last time he underestimated the witcher he ordered the Professor to deal with it and fled once more. Afterwards he returned to his work on mutations to provide the Grand Master with the army requested.
Last fight.
Javed ultimately took to hiding out at the main hide out at the Old Manor but the witcher soon tracked him down. Using mutant assassins and mutated Rayla to get rid of Geralt, Javed himself mostly waited down in his laboratory. When Geralt slashed through that first obstacle, Javed sicced his koshchey on the witcher.
That too, however, didn't stop the proficient monster slayer and so Javed finally sent in several massive greater brothers. Ultimately, though, Geralt got to him and the final confrontation ensued, leading to Azar Javed's death.
Legacy.
The word of Salamandra's fall and Javed's demise got around during the year that followed. Two remnants of his criminal guild, led by Dmitri and Vencel Pugg, operating far from the center of events in Flotsam, kept on for some time but had little to no significance.
Personality and appearance.
Azar Javed was a bald, swarthy Zerrikanian with a black beard and sinister gaze. He adorned his body with complex piercings and leather strap accessories, especially face and neck, as was the custom in his native land. His look was completed by a leather jerkin full of chains and amulets hanging around and a pair of pointed shoes.
As a person, Javed was a thoroughly ruthless man with a peculiar sense of morality who considered murder, rape, treason, and extortion all as means to an end. He liked to enjoy pleasures life had to offer, and so he let his lust go unchecked and took large doses of purest fisstech. Ramsmeat described him as a wild man. Furthermore, the Zerrikanian's connection with fire run so deep some said it had become a part of his very being. True or not, Javed did have a pyromaniac fetish that scared the Viziman prostitutes. When it came to politics, Javed detested Foltest for the rampage caused by the striga in the past, as well as for the king's attempt at a truce with the Nilfgaardian Empire during the Second Northern War, which the mage viewed as a betrayal of the North.
Journal entry.
Mysterious Mage
 "The mage attacked Kaer Morhen in order to steal the witchers' secrets hidden in the fortress."
 "One of the leaders of the forces that attacked Kaer Morhen was a mage so powerful that even Triss Merigold could not oppose him. The organization that he leads uses the symbol of the salamander."
 "The mysterious mage using the salamander symbol is a skilled alchemist who is researching mutation."
Azar Javed
 "The mysterious mage is Azar Javed - an exotic name suggesting that he comes from a distant place."
 "The mage is in hiding, yet his influence extends over the whole of Vizima and possibly beyond."
 "The man I'm looking for is addicted to fisstech. He takes large amounts of the drug in its purest form."
 "My adversary is a renegade mage. This means that, for some reason, he was expelled from the wizards' circle. In the past, renegade mages performed the witchers' mutations."
 "Even powerful men have their weaknesses - Azar likes to bask in luxury."
 "Women are another weakness of this wizard, and his lust is equal to his appetite for magical power."
 "Azar Javed specializes in the element of fire. Not only does the mage use fire magic with great expertise, it seems that fire has become a part of his being."
 "I have learned that Azar Javed has political ambitions, which is quite typical of wizards."
 "The illusion is gone. It turned out that Azar Javed, the Salamandra leader, has been deceiving me by pretending to be detective Raymond."
 If Javed is not unveiled until the tower confrontation:
 "I didn't unmask him in time and he was able to outsmart me."
 If Javed is unveiled before the tower confrontation:
 "Luckily I managed to see through the ruse and outsmart him."
 "During the fight with the Professor, the mage came to his companion's rescue. This time he was unable to stop me, and I forced him to flee."
 "According to the Professor's notes, Azar Javed is in Salamandra's hidden laboratory, where he is working to put the secrets of Kaer Morhen to use."
 "Azar Javed died by my hand after the duel in the Salamandra laboratory."

Berengar was a witcher of the School of the Wolf taught by Vesemir at Kaer Morhen and active during the 13th century.
Biography.
During his time at Kaer Morhen, he was attempting to forge the sword Tor'haerne, and left to fight a chort in the valley. He was unsuccessful and lost the diagram for the sword.
"The Witcher".
After a long search through the swamp, Geralt finds a cloven Salamandra medallion, along with Berengar's belongings leading him to conclude that Berengar must be dead. However, in Chapter IV, Geralt finds Berengar, still very much alive just outside of Murky Waters.
Berengar and Geralt work together briefly, before Berengar explains why he left Kaer Morhen. He voices his disdain for the Witchers, whom he holds responsible for denying him a normal life. Later, on Black Tern Island, Berengar confronts Geralt with the intention of challenging him to a duel, forcing Geralt to choose once again, his next course of action.
If he spares Berengar, then Geralt will have an ally to aid in the final battle with Azar Javed. If he duels with Berengar (as Geralt tells Berengar, just before the fight), only one can come out alive and Geralt prevails. This leaves Geralt with Berengar's remaining belongings, which include a powerful medallion, so powerful in fact, that Azar Javed cannot fail to notice it in the final battle.
Note that when Azar Javed kills Berengar (if Geralt spared him earlier), the powerful medallion cannot be found on his corpse.
Notes.
It is actually possible to prevent Azar Javed from killing Berengar at the end of Chapter V, but nothing happens between Geralt and Berengar if this is the case. When the player clicks on Berengar, the witcher says: "I needed time to think" as a normal NPC would do, no choice dialogues appear. If Geralt returns to the Laboratory in the catacombs of the Old Mansion, Berengar is still standing there as if the game never expected the player to prevent Berengar's death.
Associated quests.
Berengar is implicated in the following quests:
"Vesemir mentioned a witcher who had left Kaer Morhen before my arrival. His name is Berengar."
"Berengar was seen in the Outskirts earlier. He agreed to kill the Beast but then disappeared. Did he fear facing the monster?"
"I found out Berengar had dealings with Salamandra. I don't know whether he was their associate or enemy."
"Berengar remains one step ahead of me. He was in Vizima, where he was hired by Kalkstein the alchemist. Just like me."
"Berengar the witcher is dead."
"The early rumors about Berengar proved false. The witcher was working with Salamandra, and the Professor had ordered him to find Alvin."
"I finally met Berengar in the village of Murky Waters. A bitter and unfriendly outcast, he bears a grudge against other witchers. Apparently, I'm included."
"I had a serious conversation with Berengar, which left me with a better understanding of his experiences and motivations. Berengar seemed moved and decided to seek peace elsewhere, far away from trouble".
"Berengar wrote a letter in which he admitted that he was a coward, that he had collaborated with Salamandra and that he had betrayed Kaer Morhen. I was moved by our meeting - Berengar set off to Vizima to catch Azar Javed in a hidden Salamandra laboratory."
If Geralt kills Berengar:
"After a tense conversation, Berengar challenged me to a duel. I had to kill him."
If Geralt spares Berengar:
"This time it was Berengar who followed me. He came to my aid as I fought Azar Javed. Unfortunately, he perished, but his sacrifice was not in vain."
Journal entry.
There is no additional entry to Berengar's character section if the player prevents Javed from killing him.
Berengar and another witcher who seems to be Lambert appear in Geralt's dream at the beginning of the second game.
Associated quests.
Although deceased, Berengar is indirectly involved in the Kaer Morhen quest Berengar's Blade. The quest cannot be triggered if Geralt already has the silver blade Tor'haerne in his possession. Also, while doing the , Geralt can tell his contract giver which school he belongs to. When answering he belongs to the school of the Wolf, Count Kurt Dysart will tell him he once knew a witcher from the school of the wolf, his name beginning with the letter B, possible referring to Berengar.

Yaevinn was an elf and a member of Toruviel's Scoia'tael commando, later leading his own regiment in the vicinity of Vizima. He had a greater penchant for flowery words and metaphors than most elves, perhaps rivaling Dandelion alone in his prose.
Biography.
Hunting Dh'oine.
In June 1267, while on reconnaissance in the Pontar Valley with Yaevinn and Toruviel, Cairbre aep Diared noticed a lone rider on route from Tretogor to Vengerberg. Toruviel kicked Yaevinn awake and two had a discussion about the morals of killing the lone human, though as the messenger reached 150 paces away, Yaevinn loosened an arrow, which struck him through the chest, falling off his horse onto hot sands. The elf wasn't aware sparing his life would have prevented the provocation at Glevitzingen and the subsequent war.
Second Northern War.
Yaevinn participated in the Second Northern War with Nilfgaard. During the Battle of Brenna, where he was part of the Vrihedd Brigade, he and his commando entered in the medic tent of Rusty and started to kill all the patients but they immediately stopped when they saw that the medic and his assistants were healing wounded people from both the factions, making no difference between Nilfgaardians and Nordlings.
He was later seriously injured in that battle but in the end he survived his wounds.
"The Witcher".
Yaevinn appears in Chapter II of the game. He treats Geralt with hesitant respect and appeals to him to aid his faction; he reminds him that as a mutant, he would never be accepted in human society, only tolerated and could better relate to the cause of the Scoia'tael. He is eloquent and often speaks in verse, employing metaphors and literary allusions to convey his meaning.
If the witcher chooses to ally himself with the Scoia'tael, Yaevinn plays an even more central role in the story. It is also Toruviel who is a member of Yaevinn's group rather than the other way around, although he does not seem to outrank her by much. Later he is pardoned by Foltest for helping to stop Jacques de Aldersberg.
"Yaevinn the elf is as conceited as he is eloquent. He seems cunning and wise; moreover, he despises humans, considering them aggressive barbarians, and has respect only for the Elder Races. Still, this disillusioned elf treats me with respect in his own, peculiar way. Everything suggests that Yaevinn is preparing for battle — in the swamp he has created a training camp for the Scoia'tael under his command."
 Scoia'tael Path:
"The Scoia'tael led by Yaevinn defeated the Order of the Flaming Rose during the clash in the Golem Burial Ground."
"Yaevinn is interested in artifacts of historical value for the nonhumans — he's looking for something which could serve as a banner for his Scoia'tael. Yaevinn remains a cynic and a pragmatist even when thinking about the heritage of the Elder Blood."
"During the bank robbery in the Trade Quarter I decided to support the Scoia'tael. Yaevinn believes that the stolen money will finance an uprising."
"I asked Yaevinn for military support during the assault on Salamandra's headquarters in Vizima. The elf, who was among those invited to Leuvaarden's reception, agreed to help me dismantle the organization."
"On the hill under the Old Manor my friend aided me again. We stood shoulder to shoulder against Salamandra."
 Order's path:
"Yaevinn accused me of causing Toruviel's death. A fight broke out and he died by my hand."
 Neutral path:
"Yaevinn accused me of causing Toruviel's death. I didn't let him provoke me and he went his own way."
"".
On Iorveth's path during Chapter II, the Scoia'tael leader will discuss Yaevinn's legacy with Geralt in Vergen if the latter sided with the Scoia'tael or remained neutral in "The Witcher".
Yaevinn, same as Iorveth, does not appear in game and apart from the second one, he is not even mentioned by other characters, but he has his own gwent card as part of Scoia'tael Gwent deck. His name is also appears on the "Sylvan" glossary entry alongside with his quotation to sylvans.

Rayla of Lyria, known first as Black Rayla and later as White Rayla, was a natural-born soldier and a veteran of the wars with Nilfgaard. She was a mercenary and later an officer of the special forces of King Demavend III of Aedirn. While she was guarding the withdrawal of civilians from invaded Aedirn, her unit was wiped out by Scoia'tael commandos. She survived the capture, albeit maimed and disfigured.
Biography.
Early life.
Rayla was the daughter of an elven woman and a human man, making her a half-elf. She was born in Lyria, where she lived in a hamlet. Her neighbors, however, fearing Scoia'tael commandos, showed nothing but hatred towards Rayla and her family, who were constantly bullied, discriminated against, and beaten. In the end, Rayla started hating non-humans even more than her former neighbors, despite secretly being one of them.
She soon became a mercenary and departed for adventures. At some point in her life she met Geralt of Rivia, witnessed his fighting skills, and became impressed by them. She also visited Vengerberg a few times.
She fought for Nordlings during the First Northern War. Later, she participated in a gathering at Bleobheris, during which she watched Dandelion's performance and discussed with other spectators the events described in his ballad.
Aedirnian Special Forces.
Some time later, Rayla joined the Aedirnian Special Forces formed by King Demavend. In June 1267, she was tasked with escorting Archmistress Tissaia de Vries to The Silver Heron in Gors Velen. There, Yennefer argued that Rayla, as a "mercenary" fighting for money, would not be able to make sacrifices like the soldiers who fought with conviction and sacrifice, while Margarita Laux-Antille defended the captain. After completing her duties, she left with her unit back to Aedirn.
Early stages of war.
When the Second Northern War broke out, Rayla's unit was sent by King Demavend to defend Lower Aedirn from Nilfgaardian invaders. However, instead of Nilfgaardians, the unit faced a vanguard of Scoia'tael, who captured Rayla's men and attempted to execute them. Fortunately for them, the elves were all slaughtered by a convoy of Lyrian soldiers who were passing nearby. Surprisingly for Rayla, the unit was led by none other than Meve, Queen of Lyria and Rivia, who was escaping from her country after the Lyrian golpe and was entering Aedirn, where she was hoping to receive military aid from King Demavend. Driven by common interest, Rayla and her men joined Meve's party and headed to Rosberg, where the King was last seen.
Alas, the Nilfgaardian invasion proceeded without obstacle and what remained of Rosberg was burned ruins. One of the few survivors, Xavier Lemmens, informed Queen Meve and Rayla that King Demavend left Rosberg before the siege and was now preparing his defense at Aldersberg.
At Aldersberg, the unit finally met King Demavend; Nilfgaardian troops commanded by Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn, however, had already started besieging the city.
In the end Lyrians and Aedirnians joined forces and clashed against the Nilfgaardians in what would be later known as the First Battle of Aldersberg. Although Meve and Demavend's troops were defeated and Aldersberg was burned down, the two monarchs managed to save both their lives and those of the citizens of Aldersberg.
Following the battle, Demavend fled to Redania. Before leaving Meve, however, he handed her the Leaden Ring, a token which would've given her permission to enter the enclave of Mahakam and ask for military help from Brouver Hoog, the Elder-in-Chief. The King of Aedirn also tasked Rayla with escorting the Queen to her destination.
In Mahakam, Rayla was forced to leave Meve because she had to return to Aedirn, since Nilfgaardian troops were now heading towards Demavend's capital, Vengerberg.
Sack of Vengerberg.
After the Battle of Vengerberg was won by Nilfgaard, Rayla's unit protected the civilians fleeing through the Pontar Valley to Temeria. When the Aedirnian army's rearguard was obliterated by Scoia'tael, she ordered her men to stay and become the rearguard themselves, despite their reluctance. She was the last to stand after a fierce battle, surrounded by Scoia'tael. They asked her to drop her weapon, but she replied her sword was too expensive to drop and if they wished to take it, they should break her fingers to do so.
White Rayla.
Rayla appears again in 1268 – not with broken fingers but missing her whole hand, replaced by a steel hook. While she survived, she apparently suffered much; even her hair turned white. Calling herself "White Rayla", she was full of rage and hatred towards the Scoia'tael. After the Battle of Brenna she pursued Toruviel's commandos.
Five years after the Battle of Brenna, Rayla continued her hunt for the remaining Scoia'tael while acting as a mercenary for the Order of the Flaming Rose. Leading a unit of Knights of the Order, Rayla arrived in Murky Waters, a small town near Vizima, after hearing of the presence of Toruviel's commandos. After the elves took the villagers hostage, Rayla entrusted the witcher Geralt to tell the elves that she promised a fair trail if they freed the hostages. However, Rayla was then stripped of her command of the unit by an Order adjuntant, citing a letter from Siegfried, in order to take the elves head-on.
During the conflict in Old Vizima, Rayla, still working for the Order of the Flaming Rose, was shot twice in the chest by Yaevinn's arrows, leaving her in a near-death state. Later on, she was found and taken by the Salamandra in order to subject her to their mutation process. She thus survived her wounds at the cost of losing most of her mental faculties. She was then used to attack Geralt, who finally put an end to her life.
Rayla is a character in Thronebreaker. She can be recruited by Meve as a companion at the start of the quest Ashes of Aedirn.
"The Witcher".
Depending on the path Geralt chose, White Rayla was one of three possible, but mutually exclusive, sexual partners Geralt can have in Chapter V. He will sleep with her if he chooses the Order path.
"The hunt for the free elves who had been resting near Murky Waters was led by White Rayla, a mercenary hired by the Order. Rayla is a natural-born soldier and a veteran of the wars with Nilfgaard, during which she was maimed and disfigured. Rayla is used to discipline and has but one passion — she hates elves and hunts them with unwavering ruthlessness."
"Rayla surrounded Toruviel's elves in the village of Murky Waters, but the situation got out of control. A fight broke out between her soldiers and the elves."
If Geralt complete the Order path:
"I decided to help Rayla during the siege of Murky Waters, thus helping her to defeat Toruviel's elves."
"White Rayla returned to Vizima. She was slain by elven arrows as non-humans and knights of the Order clashed in the burning city."
"I met the mercenary again. Salamandra found her close to death and subjected her to mutation. Rayla recuperated and , as a mutant, regained her strength in no time. In return for her second life, she had to swear absolute loyalty to her new masters. She tried to stop me and I had to kill her. For good this time."

Adda the White was princess of Temeria and the result of the incestuous relationship between King Foltest and his sister Adda, whom her daughter was named after. 
She was stillborn, dying along with her mother who died during childbirth, as a result of a curse. It's unclear if this was cast by Ostrit, a local magnate who was in love with Adda and attempted to put a curse on the king and it rebounded to the sister and their unborn child, or Foltest and Adda's mother, Sancia, who was also furious at the incestuous relationship between her children and may also have cursed their child. Seven years after her funeral, however, she was reborn as a striga.
Her nickname "the White", which came from the color of her hair after the curse was removed by Geralt, served to distinguish her from her mother, Adda of Temeria, and Adda of Cidaris, the wife of King Goidemar. She was also left mentally impaired, so while she remained the logical heir to the Temerian throne, the continuation of the royal line begun by Geddes was possibly at its end.
Biography.
While Adda's human form was fully restored, her mind was left terribly degraded by trauma, and she is still in danger of relapse. To ward off the curse, Geralt instructed the princess to wear an amulet necklace and told her keeper to have her participate in rituals designed to ward off the curse.
Unfortunately, even though Adda's curse was lifted, she remained intellectually impaired. It was also then that her hair became white, which earned her the name "Adda the White".
In the non-canon short story "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna", Adda seems to have recovered sufficiently from her curse to have become the queen of Temeria.
"The Witcher".
In the "Temerian Dynasty", additional material written by Andrzej Sapkowski and published on his official website, Adda was described as white-haired and intellectually impaired. However, in the game and in the English translation of the short story "The Witcher", her hair is red and there is no explanation for the change in her mental state.
The princess had grown into a pretty, if some what wild and spoiled girl whom Geralt met at Leuvaarden's reception, where she was accompanied by the ever attentive Roderick de Wett. If Geralt refused to have sex with her she then reveals a small tidbit about her intentions regarding her father's crown.
According to the Professor's notes, Adda collaborated with Salamandra. She was behind the counterfeiting of the royal seal and forged the proclamations of the state of emergency, and therefore was responsible for the chaos in the Trade Quarter. She was promised the throne of Temeria, though in reality Salamandra believed her to be unpredictable and would not likely have honored that bargain. The organization planned to break the alliance.
When Ostrit put a curse on Adda, he described the process in his diary. Whoever possessed the diary may renew the curse and transform Adda back into a striga. But Adda is not only dangerous as a striga, she is equally dangerous with the power she wields as a princess. It is only thanks to Triss' intervention that Geralt managed to escape Adda's (manicured) claws by the skin of his teeth.
 "At Leuvaarden's reception I had the chance to meet Princess Adda. Some years ago I relieved her of the striga curse, and the princess has grown into a pretty, if somewhat wild and spoiled girl."
 "According to the Professor's notes, Adda collaborated with Salamandra. She was behind the counterfeiting of the royal seal and forged the proclamation of the state of emergency. She was promised the throne of Temeria, though in reality Salamandra believed her to be unpredictable. The organization planned to break the alliance."
 "It turned out that Adda was behind the forgery of the royal seals and responsible for the chaos in the Trade Quarter. The princess had been collaborating with Salamandra, but it seems this alliance was too much for her. Thanks to Triss' intervention, I managed to escape Adda's claws by the skin of my teeth."
 "Princess Adda was born of an incestuous union and came into this world as a striga. This was the consequence of a curse cast by a jealous courtier who had loved her mother. For several years the striga roamed Old Vizima, stalking and devouring the unwary. Until I arrived, no one had been able to kill her or lift the curse. Adda did not fully regain her personality, however, and there is still danger of a relapse. That's why the princess wears amulets and participates in rituals designed to ward off the curse."
 If Geralt kills the striga:
 "The curse of the striga returned and Adda changed into a monster again. This time I had to kill her."
 If Geralt lifts the curse:
 "The curse of striga returned and Adda changed into a monster again. I managed to free her of the spell once more."
 "Princess Adda was born a striga as a result of Ostrit's curse. The magnate was in love with the king's sister and Adda's mother, whose name was also Adda. When he learned of the incestuous relationship between the king and his sister, Ostrit put a curse on the king and described the process in his diary. Whoever possesses the diary may renew the curse and transform Adda back into a striga."
The Gift.
Adda wants catoblepas meat, rare is best. To obtain the item, speak to Velerad, the burgomeister, but do not forget some strong alcohol to loosen his tongue. Then he will point you in the direction of Thaler, who wants a letter from a chest in the nearby alcove before revealing any more information. Finally, speak to Triss, as she can conjure the necessary gift for the princess.
Adda is a mentioned-only, secondary character in the second game.
The book The Temerian Royal Dynasty provides in-game information about Adda. If you have imported a saved game before starting, then the journal entry added by that book is based on the choices made in that game (otherwise Adda is dead by default).
One of Chorab's tales is about Geralt lifting the curse from Adda for the first time.
If Adda was killed in the original game
If Adda was spared in the original game
Journal entry.
If Adda was spared in the first game:
"King Foltest's daughter had been cursed even before leaving her mother's womb and turned into a striga as a child. The jag-toothed princess had long terrorized Vizima, until Geralt lifted the curse. It returned after a few years, but the witcher managed to lift it a second time. Later Adda became the wife of Radovid V, king of Redania."
If Geralt saved Adda in the first game, then she is still Queen of Redania, though the developers decided not to introduce her in "The Witcher 3" and explore her plotline further. She is mentioned only in an old letter, found in the courtyard of the Royal Palace in Vizima, where some Alyssandra Deviel wrote to Roderick de Wett on how to revive the curse.
Adda is a Northern Realms leader in the Homecoming version.
"Scroll 1: A beautiful young girl with a button nose and a storm of red hair – what's there to fear? Well, appearances can be deceiving... And in Adda's case, more so than usual."
"Scroll 2: It appeared the witcher had, indeed, cured the ghastly affliction that gave Adda the rather nasty habit of turning into a striga. But if you believe the rumors, the princess has been known to relapse."
"Scroll 3: At first, it was thought Adda had been cursed by the gods, for she was the product of an incestuous affair between King Foltest and his sister, Adda of Temeria. The truth, as is often the case, was revealed to be quite different..."
"Scroll 4: The witcher's investigation showed that a romantically-frustrated courtier by name of Ostrit was responsible for Adda's curse. Unsurprisingly, it seemed the gods had played no role, proving yet again to be indifferent toward the foul deeds of man... Fortunately, one does not require divine power to rout out wickedness."
"Chest 1: Upon discovering Adda had been transformed into a striga, King Foltest immediately promised a weighty reward to any who could disenchant the princess... And a swift retribution to any who dared slay her. A long while passed before someone stepped up to the task. The volunteer turned out to be none other than Geralt of Rivia, a witcher from the School of the Wolf."
"Chest 2: After Geralt lifted the curse, it seemed Adda had become an ordinary girl. Pleasant, eloquent, undeniably beautiful – she quickly became the pride and joy of the Temerian court. However, dark rumors began to circulate among the royal family's servants. In her bedchamber, away from prying eyes, Adda had committed horrible atrocities against her maidservants... Though, details remain unknown as many were never to be seen again."
"Chest 3: A telling sign that Adda's curse had not been fully undone was her love for catoblepas flesh. The meat of a catoblepas – known also as a gorgon – has a very peculiar taste, disturbingly similar to that of human flesh. Considering the beasts are scarce and their meat a rare delicacy at banquets in the Temerian court, Princess Adda was forced to settle for a more readily available substitute."

The Lady of the Lake is a powerful being, considered by some to be a vila or nymph, worshipped by both vodyanoi and humans in places of chilvalry like the surroundings of Vizima in Temeria and the whole duchy of Toussaint.
"The Witcher".
The Lady of the Lake is worshipped by both the inhabitants of Murky Waters and the Vodyanoi with whom they grudgingly co-exist. She spends her time in a shallow, lily-pad filled covered inlet on Black Tern Island and can be consulted there on various matters relating to Destiny, her servants, quests for the Holy Grail and the relations between the locals.
Even goddesses get lonely. It is tough being the object of adulation and reverence. While most locals will tell you that they love the Lady, they would never dream of actual "physical" contact with her. In this regard, Geralt has no such qualms and can generously provide companionship of the more mundane kind.
To obtain the dialog option to romance her, Geralt must first speak to the Hermit after speaking to her and ask him about the grail. Failing to do so makes the romance option unavailable. To get the romance card, Geralt must first tell the Lady of the Lake that he ["has"] "had" ""a revelation and [wishes] to embark on a mission". This will cause the Lady's hackles to go up and she'll stop him then and there (having only just told him that she takes a dim view of grail quests), but then the witcher says claims it was only "A jest..." "and they continue their conversation.
She gets around to the fact that it is lonely being a goddess and while she is fully aware that her subjects may lust for her, they would never dare act on those feelings. She tells the witcher that he should compliment her, so he does, in a fairly lame manner, which she is quick to point out. Finally he gets an inspiration and decides to compliment her ass, saying it puts others to shame. This amuses her greatly and they finally get to know each other better.
If he persists with the quest "of paramount importance" conversation, and it does initially sound noble, the Lady knights him "Sir Bonehead" and dismisses him from her sight, none too fondly. Geralt can then still speak with her, he can even backtrack on the grail quest, but no sex. And she tells him so, saying "you know not how much you have lost".
 "On an island in the middle of the lake I encountered a supernatural being known as the Lady of the Lake. She is a nymph or a vila. Both the inhabitants of the nearby villages and the monsters of the lake worship her."
 "The Lady appointed me her champion and gave me a silver sword. Thus was I admitted into the ranks of the many noble knights who have served her over the centuries. The Lady predicted that the sword she gave me will prove important as I pursue my mission."
 "I left Murky Waters and returned to Vizima. I have a feeling the Lady of the Lake's domain was the only place where I might have found peace. What a pity."
Her servants.
These are her more active servants, not mere worshipers, the Fisher King and the Hermit. It is the Hermit's duty to the Lady to guard over the kurgen of the knights who died defending her honor.
"Blood and Wine" expansion.
Geralt can meet her again in the second expansion for "", during There Can Be Only One secondary quest. After he fulfills five chivalric virtues and defeats the Hermit in a fight, she gives him Aerondight and tells him that she hopes that this time the witcher won't lose it again.
Also during early conversations with first Guillaume de Launfal and then Anna Henrietta it is said that Lady of the Lake gave true chivalry to Toussaint and it was also she who cursed sir Luis Alberni, once proud nobleman who violated his vows, into becoming the giant named Golyat.
 "Geralt had first encountered the Lady of the Lake when his search for what had been stolen from Kaer Morhen took him to the village known as Murky Waters. There a mysterious female being dwelled in the murky depths of the village's namesake waters and watched over the residents living on the shores. Such was their esteem for their underwater guardian, they erected a monument in her honor. The Lady of the Lake once had many knights in her service, but they had all died, as valiant knights tend to, during campaigns in far-off lands. She now lived in near solitude, so was glad to accept Geralt's company, the witcher being someone she liked and respected."
 "Once the witcher had believed the Lady of the Lake was some kind of local goddess, but their reunion at Lac Célavy made him realize she did not dwell only in Murky Waters. Instead, the Lady of the Lake calls home any place where virtue and chivalry are honored."
 "According to legend, Golyat had once been a knight who violated his vows, for which he was punished by the Lady of the Lake. Transformed into a giant, he fled into the mountains and would only descend into the inhabited lowlands when hunger forced him to it. There's no knowing how much truth lies in that legend, yet it is incontrovertible fact that this dangerous giant gobbled up shepherds and sheep alike, and was so widely feared, governesses used him to scare children into eating their vegetables."
 "Though he came across as a wild, unthinking beast, Golyat used simple tools and any item could turn into a deadly weapon in his powerful hands. When fighting Geralt, Golyat wielded a millstone, making his every blow truly crushing. Luckily, Geralt already had some experience slaying giants and made quick work of Golyat as well, with the much appreciated help of three knights - Milton de Peyrac Peyran, Palmerin de Launfal and Guillaume de Launfal."
Her servants.
Virtually every knight errant in the duchy is a servant of Duke and Lady but the one and only being truly bound to her by duty is a certain Hermit at Lac Célavy who is guarding the five chivalric virtues. There is also the Fisher King but he is just collecting herbs and transporting worthy folks on islet with his boat.

Golan Vivaldi is a dwarf, and part of the "Vivaldi family", a well known family of dwarven financiers and bankers. One of their banks is located in the nearby Trade Quarter, but it is now being run by new human owners after a hostile takeover.
Vivaldi is very touchy about his race and has always had a fierce hatred of humans. The takeover, and resulting bankruptcy, combined with his racial views, easily explains the conditions in which Geralt finds him, namely bitter and living in squalor in the nonhuman district of the Temple Quarter. He is right next door to Kalkstein, in fact.
Actually, in one possible scenario, Vivaldi is being arrested by City Guards at his home when Geralt first finds him. Geralt must then bail him out of jail in order to speak with him.
He knows Yaevinn and has had dealings, of a purely financial nature of course, with the Scoia'tael. Despite his suffering at the hands of humans, Vivaldi will not help the Scoia'tael during the Worth its Weight in Gold quest, and would not, even if he still had control of his bank and fortune. Yaevinn, however, will disregard Vivaldi's negative attitude to his cause, and will try to get access to the bank's vaults by tricking Geralt into clearing an underground passage into the bank in Echoes of Yesterday and the subsequent bank heist, Gold Rush.
"Golan Vivaldi is a dwarf who's very touchy about his race. The Vivaldis are financiers and one of their banks is located in Vizima's Trade Quarter."
"The money for the Professor's bail came from Vivaldi's bank. That's how the criminal walked free."
"Vivaldi lost control of the family business. There was a hostile takeover and the bank is now controlled by human owners. That explains the dwarf's bitterness as well as his poverty."
"I unfairly suspected Vivaldi of financing Salamandra. The evidence indicates he is innocent."
"The dwarf hates humans. Apparently, in doing business with them, he's had a chance to see them at their worst."
"Vivaldi has relations with nonhumans, including the persecuted Scoia'tael."

After his stay in the rather idyllic village of Murky Waters, Geralt is forced to return to Vizima where there is now open fighting in the streets. As he and Dandelion approach the city by boat, they can see that it is now ablaze. After a brief stop on the dike to get his bearings and the latest news, the witcher heads towards Old Vizima.
"Surrounded by a low palisade, Old Vizima conjures the spirit of yesteryear, when even the capitals of powerful nations looked like the makeshift collection of thatched wooden huts, and their streets were filled with hens and dirty children. Relocating his seat from the old manor to the Royal castle, King Foltest began the long process of converting Vizima from a wooden village into a brick town."
"The war was merciless to Old Vizima's inhabitants. At its end, the area became something of a ghetto for non-humans — assimilated elves and dwarves were forced to settle where even the poor did not want to live. Currently Old Vizima is an area of skirmishes between knights of the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael."

Redania, named after Roeden, is a wealthy realm which profits from trade and agriculture and one of the Four Kingdoms. The capital city of Redania is Tretogor; other prominent cities include Oxenfurt, with the largest university in the Northern Realms, and the free city of Novigrad. The kingdom's neighbors are Kovir, Caingorn, Kaedwen, Aedirn, and Temeria.
History.
Settlement.
Redania was first settled by the Dauk and Wozgor people sometime before the First Landing in the 760s, specifically the Gelibol region and the Nimnar valley, according to a classification by the historian Arnelius Grock.
Northern Wars.
In 1263, during the First Northern War, the Royal Redanian Army, along with the forces of Aedirn, Temeria, and Kaedwen, faced the invading Nilfgaardian Army in Lower Sodden, during the Battle of Sodden Hill. The northern armies were under the united leadership of King Vizimir II of Redania, and were successful in preventing the Nilfgaardian invasion.
After the war, tensions rose with Temeria, and King Vizimir II forced Novigrad into "ius stapulae", blocking all merchandise routes and seizing any wares from Nilfgaard or Temeria. King Foltest of Temeria responded by introducing the same law to Vizima and Gors Velen, blocking all Redanian wares, which started to affect the economy as Redania did not have the resources or manufactories to produce their own goods.
King Vizimir II of Redania was assassinated during the Second Nilfgaard War. During the interregnum, the country was ruled by a Regency Council headed by Sigismund Dijkstra, the head of Redanian Intelligence, and Philippa Eilhart, head of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Subsequently, reached the proper age, the country passed in the hands of Radovid V, known as "The Stern".
Society.
Structure of the society.
Quite specific is the social structure of this country - the cult of the nobility runs strong in Redania, and higher social stratum possesses more privilege here than in any nearby realm. Great differences in wealth exist among the gentry, but Redanian law cares for birth not property, making a well-born beggar the legal equal of the richest magnate. Those of high birth and great wealth draw the latter primarily from the grain trade and pedigreed horse husbandry.
As a consequence of nobility's privileged position, the peasantry is treated worse here than in any neighboring state, and only the king's iron fist keeps them from rebelling. The government of Redania is also heavily influenced by sorceresses.
Culture.
Religion and traditions.
On Saovine, Redanian children burn figurines of Falka on bonfires, to remember her famous rebellion.
Military/intelligence.
Redanian steeds are unsurpassed, and thus the Redanian cavalry is among the best of its kind in the world, and with the country's nobility filling its ranks, it is the heart of Royal Redanian Army.
For ages, Redania has fought a customs war with Temeria, its primary rival in the North. Redania possesses the best intelligence network in the world, and throughout history they have infiltrated many of their rivals fellow agencies.
Economy and trade.
The Kingdom derives enormous profits from trade with Novigrad as well as grain exports. It may be said that the monarchy is the granary of the whole Continent, and even other parts of the world. Therefore, the dominant landscape of Redania is huge, undulating fields of grain. In the 13th century, the state economy became seriously threatened, because of the flow of cheap goods from and others into the country, which constitute serious competition for local artisans. In addition, there are very few manufactories.
National emblems.
 The colors of the Kingdom of Redania are white and red, and the coat of arms from time immemorial has been the silver eagle in a red field. Of this eagle, the ancient emblem of King Abrad the Old Oak, various motions and forms were, notwithstanding presently the insigne is like King Radovid IV had determined and approved in edict: Gules, an eagle displayed Argent crowned, beaked and membered Or, grasping in the dexter claw an sceptre Or. The eagle is charged on the breast with an escutcheon: Sable a cross Or. Escutcheon is arms of Jamurlak, country located in the interfluve of rivers Buina and Braa ultimately vassalized by Crown of Redania during reign of Radovid the Bald. Coats of Arms of the Respectable Royal and Knightly Houses, their blazon and historyOver the course of ages the Redanian Eagle changed its form and features several times, diversing a number of heads, grasped accessories, presence of crown, inescutcheon and other elements. The current coat of arms of Redania, adopted by Radovid IV, is displayed in the infobox, while some of the historical ones are presented below.

Redania
"Redania borders Temeria in the north. It is ruled by King Radovid V, also knows as Radovid the Stern, son of the murdered King Vizimir. The monarch was thirteen when his father was killed, so the Royal Council assumed power until the prince came of age. After his coronation, Radovid gained notoriety for dealing brutally with anyone who had previously mistreated him or his mother Hedvig. The most important cities in Redania are the capital of Tretogor, the Free City of Novigrad, which enjoys far-reaching autonomy, and Oxenfurt, with its famous university."
"One of the Northern Kingdoms, Redania is a wealthy realm which profits from trade and agriculture. For ages, it has fought a customs war with Temeria, which is its main competitor in the north. The country possesses the best intelligence service in the world. The government of Redania is heavily influenced by sorceresses."

You can find Redanians in their quarter during the third act in Loc Muinne.
Redania
"Situated between the Braa River in the north and the Pontar in the south, Redania is one of the North's more important kingdoms. Its coat of arms is a crowned silver eagle on a red field. The eagle grips a golden scepter in its talons and a small black shield bearing a golden cross adorns its proudly protruding chest. Despite recent unrest, the country survived, unscathed and intact, the crisis that followed the death of King Vizimir the Just. Tretogor, King Radovid's seat of power, is the country's capital, though the Free City of Novigrad is its largest population center. In fact, Novigrad is something akin to the capital of the world - a center and cradle of commerce and culture, where an enlightened man can breathe his fill as long as he does so away from the back alleys. Old, musty and scholarly Oxenfurt, the home of this author's alma mater, is another of the kingdom's noteworthy cities. During the last war with Nilfgaard, Redania joined with Temeria, Aedirn, Kaedwen and other northern realms to repel the invaders, and the Royal Redanian Corps played an important part during the Battle of Brenna."
Journal entry.
In "The Witcher 3", Redania is ruled by King Radovid V who's poised to take over Temeria, having already conquered most of Kaedwen and Caingorn.
Redania is currently engaged in armed conflict against the Nilfgaardian Empire and, depending on Geralt's choices, the Third Nilfgaard War can either end with Redania winning and conquering all the northern realms while Nilfgaard remains or Nilfgaard winning and conquering Redania and all the other northern realms.

Fields

"In the fields surrounding the village, golden stalks of grain proudly sway in the wind, while the picturesque ruins of an old mill and a small hermit's hut give the place a fairy tale feel. Recently, this idyllic scene was disrupted by the appearance of noonwraiths, nightwraiths, renegade vodyanoi and devourers."
"It is astounding how much ancient magic is left in this land. Here stands the Druids' circle, with which the Sages can measure time and, according to some, predict the future."

Jeremiah Trick, more commonly known as Ramsmeat is the leader, or king as he likes to call himself, of Vizima's underworld, running the less than law-abiding operations in the Temple Quarter. He likes to intimidate people and it is fairly clear from the moment that Geralt meets him that he is no one to be trifled with.
He can be found in one of two places of the slums. His preferred base of operations is in the back room of The Hairy Bear. He also seems to have some sort of arrangement in place with the innkeeper, but the nature of the agreement is murky at best.
The second place is his home where he is usually accompanied by Coleman, who is part of his little criminal organization. However he is rarely home, leaving it to be guarded by two of his henchmen.
He seems to have an inexhaustible supply of minions, and he is apparently not too bothered by their frequent turnover due to shortened lifespans. Depending on the timing, if Geralt kills the two bouncers guarding Ramsmeat's house, they are simply replaced by two more the very next day. Moreover, killing the bouncers provides a key to his place saving Geralt 20 he would otherwise have had to pay in order to get inside each time.
In the "Side Effects" premium module, he still introduces himself with his real name, Jeremiah Trick. He reveals that he is working for Vizima's underground leader, Mr. Glover, but intends to take over his position and make his name known in the entire city. Geralt recommends him to use a more memorable nickname in place of his real name, apparently resulting in him adopting the alias Ramsmeat, though he tells our witcher to shove off and doesn't seem to recognize him in the main game.
 "I met Ramsmeat, the leader of a gang from the Temple Quarter. He didn't make a good impression. I think the feeling was mutual."
 "His boys react nervously to the symbol of Salamandra. It is evident that they have some links to the organization."
 "The thug probably had something to do with Berengar's disappearance."
 "Ramsmeat sent his people to Saint Lebioda's Hospital. His bandits attacked me when I tried to interrogate the prisoner being kept there."
 only if Geralt clears Ramsmeat:
 "My suspicions turned out to be false. I found proof that Ramsmeat is not the leader of Salamandra."
 only if Geralt kills Ramsmeat:
 "The gang leader died by my hand."

Raymond Maarloeve was a private investigator who ran a business in the house closest to the main entrance to the sewers, Vizima's Temple Quarter. During his early years, he trained under Codringher and Fenn from Dorian, until setting up his own detective firm in Temeria's capital. When the Order of the Flaming Rose basically took over the district he lived in, he became a friend with one of its knights, Siegfried of Denesle, who later on mentioned Maarloeve to witcher Geralt when the former was looking to take down Salamandra and Azar Javed.
He even had a book written about him called "Raymond Maarloeve - A Biography Enhanced".
Biography.
Early life.
Raymond Maarloeve was trained in ways of investigative techniques by lawyers Codringher and Fenn, famous for running successful Codringher and Fenn agency in Dorian, and worked for them for some time until he started an office of his own.
At some point in his life, he found himself a wife and together they had a son. At one night, a grisly home invasion happened in which his wife and dog were brutally murdered, and son abducted, by Salamandra. When he returned home, he discovered his wife pinned to the kitchen door with a spear, his dog shot with a crossbow, and his son nowhere to be found. As a professional, he quickly managed to learn who was behind it, but no their whereabouts.
He ran to the City Guard but, with no witnesses and no evidence to go on, the then Captain of the Guard, Vincent Meis, was forced to close the case, which did not again resurface until six months later when a bizarre monstrosity turned up in a trash heap. Raymond was able to discern that the creature was actually his own son due to a unique feature the boy had; a sixth toe, which the monster in the trash also displayed. He has since devoted the rest of his life to find their murderers.
Meeting Geralt.
Geralt of Rivia first heard of Raymond as simply a private detective friend of Siegfried's. As Geralt and Siegfried were leaving the sewers, having just killed the cockatrice, they were set upon by Salamandra. After a quick skirmish, Siegfried mentioned that Geralt should go see a friend of his, a detective, who conveniently happens to live in the house closest to the main entrance to the sewers.
Maarloeve decided to work with Geralt to uncover the Salamandra criminal organization's location and intentions as they have had something in common, a hatred of Salamandra spawned from having lost loved ones (in Geralt's case, the young Witcher in training Leo). When Geralt told Raymond that he's specifically looking for Azar Javed, because "his boot is due a rendezvous with his ass", Raymond revealed that he's been investigating Salamandra for some time.
Demise and legacy.
A time after the witcher and detective combined their forces to track down Salamandra, Raymond was murdered by Azar Javed and his identity assumed using illusion. His help prior to his untimely demise, however, did prove nonetheless valuable in uncovering some of Salamandra's operations in Vizima. After he died a dwarven dentist, Zahin Schmartz, moved into his house.
One of the clues to the fact that "Raymond" was no longer the "real" Raymond was that Geralt's medallion vibrated wildly whenever he approached Javed disguised as Raymond. Additionally, a box of fisstech could be seen to have been left lying on the downstairs table at the Detective's house. Upon noticing it, Geralt remarked: ""A small box containing fisstech. Must be evidence of some sort. I'd never suspect Raymond of being a user." "It is likely that Javed switched places with Raymond after he went into hiding after Geralt saved him from several Salamanders. Indeed, Geralt's medallion had not vibrated during the brief time it took for Raymond to walk out of the house after the fight was over.
Raymond was mentioned one last time at the end of Geralt's journey when the King of the Wild Hunt blamed Geralt for Raymond's death, implying that he thought that if the Witcher were to never have asked for Raymond's help, Azar Javed would have never killed him.
At some point prior to 1272, a book was written and published about him under the title "Raymond Maarloeve - A Biography Enhanced" with one copy being owned by Skellige's Hierophant Mousesack as discovered by Yennefer when she and Geralt searched his laboratory for Mask of Uroboros.
"I hired a detective named Raymond Maarloeve to help me search for Salamandra's leader. Raymond, a bitter and cynical man, refused to lift a finger until I paid him. But he also seems to know a lot, including his craft."
"Someone has assumed the detective's identity and I can prove it."
"I found the detective's body. Someone discovered I was working with him and clearly didn't like that. They killed him and assumed his identity. I need to know why."

Roderick de Wett was a knight of the Order of the Flaming Rose and a Nilfgaardian Count.
"The Witcher".
Geralt first meets him in the banquet facilities at The New Narakort in the Trade Quarter in Chapter III. He is a close confidant of Princess Adda and appears quite protective of her in his own manner.
He also enjoys a little dice poker on the side. After the posh reception, he can be found on the upper floor of the guardhouse in the Trade Quarter.
Later, he is found near the Old Manor where he and Geralt have possibly their final confrontation.
 "I met Count de Wett at Leuvaarden's reception. He hails from Nilfgaard, belongs to the Order of the Flaming Rose and advises King Foltest on behalf of the Order. He is exceptionally loathsome and arrogant, and he came to hate me from the moment we met. De Wett arrived at the party in the company of Princess Adda. I sense there is something going on between them."
 "De Wett turned out to be the sworn enemy of Thaler, the chief of the Temerian intelligence service.""
 "The Order acknowledged De Wett's achievements and promoted the rat. I don't know what the count did in response, but it apparently pleased his superiors."
 "The Nilfgaardian spilt the beans. Now I am certain he is to blame for the return of Adda's striga curse."
 "I killed De Wett in a fight. One less son of a bitch to worry about."

Only if Geralt kills both the werewolf and the striga:
 "I encountered De Wett's ghost in the Ice Plains."

The Queen of the Night is a higher vampire who owns a brothel (The House of the Queen of the Night) in the Trade Quarter in Vizima. Most of the women working there are, like the Queen of the Night, vampires that take blood in addition to money as payment for their sexual services.
Elder vampires do not need blood to sustain their life, it is more like alcohol or the drug that they enjoy the most. The player has the choice to kill her or keep silent in exchange for a "ménage-à-quatre" with three of her bruxa "sisters".

Velerad was a noble who, as the city's burgomeister, mayor, and castellan, governed Vizima, the capital of Temeria. In King Foltest's absence, Velerad held the highest authority in the city.
Biography.
Velerad served as castellan of Vizima for several years, and saw Princess Adda die due to a miscarriage, and then rise as a striga years later.
Curing Adda.
In 1252, he met the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who was brought to him after he killed three racists during a brawl in a local inn. The witcher brought up his true purpose for visiting the city, to cure the curse of Adda the White. Velerad explained the curse and the reward for saving her, and then went with him to the new palace, where they met with Foltest, Segelin and Ostrit. After the king left, the four other men spent a while discussing the appearance and history of the striga, before the witcher left to prepare for his contract.
Later, after Adda had been cured and Geralt was recovering in the palace, Velerad went and saw him, telling him about her transformation, though the witcher passed out mid-conversation due to exhaustion.
Third Northern War.
In early 1272, while still mourning the loss of King Foltest, Velerad was forced to govern while invading Nilfgaardian forces surrounded the city, preparing for a siege. Yannick Delen, one of the citizens of the city, offered to sneak him and his family away from the siege via boat, and so after preparing everything and hiring guards, the boat set off away from Vizima, through Blacksol, Stoonwar and then White Orchard, where they stopped, planning to continue onto Charske and set off on horseback from there.
"The Witcher".
In the game, Velerad enjoyed the distinction of being the burgomeister of Vizima. He could be found on the ground level of the guardhouse in the Trade Quarter after Gold Rush. The rumors flying around town suggested that he is ineffective in his role and spends most of his days drinking. Or perhaps this was simply the appearance he wishes to maintain.
He was a confidant of Princess Adda and knew about most of the goings on around town, despite what the citizenry considered evidence to the contrary. Technically, Geralt could sneak out during the banquet and see him at the guardhouse as well. (As of Patch 1.4, this may only be possible near the end of A Posh Reception, after the guests left, but before you talked to Leuvaarden again.)
Also, if Geralt helped the elves during the bank robbery, since the Enhanced Edition, Velerad became decidedly hostile (will not consent to a game of poker dice). He did not with previous patches.
"Velerad governs Vizima, the capital city of Temeria. In Foltest's absence, Velerad holds the highest authority in the city. The burgomeister knows me from long ago, since he was the one with whom I negotiated the contract for lifting Princess Adda's striga curse. Although I don't remember Velerad, I have a vague feeling that he has grown old and taken to drink since we first met. People say that Velerad has lost his authority and doesn't run the city as efficiently as he used to."
"The burgomeister seemed glad to see the striga problem solved. He told me his hands were tied and he could not help me find those guilty of reactivating the curse. I got the impression that Velerad cannot handle the situation now that a rebellion has engulfed Vizima."

Vaska was the eldress of the Brickmakers' village. These simple folk live in the swamp, surrounded by Clay Pits, the Maal'kad and Y'esath obelisks. She worships the Water Lords — probably vodyanoi — and is quite touchy when it comes to them. She talks in riddles and seems a bit crazy, but her flock respects her and she does provide some useful information.
She can be found during Chapters II and III either inside her hut, or just outside, doing her laundry or collecting herbs. In the Epilogue, she reappears at the safe house in the Temple Quarter where she gives Geralt one last piece of advice regarding his destiny.
Vaska is a novice dice player as well as a merchant. She buys and sells:
"Vaska is the leader of the brickmakers who live in the swamp. She talks in riddles and seems a bit crazy."
"She seems to worship the Water Lords — probably vodyanoi — and is quite touchy when it comes to them."

Morenn is a dryad from Brokilon, whom Geralt meets in the Druids' grove while exploring the Swamp. She will not say why she is there, though, saying it is a secret. If pushed, she will say that she is "taking the chance to visit this grove of old, beautiful trees".
Like other dryads, her only clothing consists of some decorative bracelets and necklaces. So she prefers to appear completely nude, leaving her breasts, buttocks and genitals exposed.
Later on, she can reveal that to Geralt that dryads do not raise boys, only girls. The witcher also learns that normally, dryads only have sex for procreation, which leaves our poor witcher with not much to offer being sterile. Never being one to give up easily, Geralt does finally come up with a convincing argument and sexual intercourse does eventually ensue.
"I got a lesson in the customs of the forest dryads. I must admit they differ from humans...in a way I like."

Vivaldi Bank

The Vivaldi family founded one of the finest banks in the known world, the Vivaldi Bank, which has branches in most major cities in the Northern Kingdoms.
History.
Giancardi association.
In early 1267, employees noticed many attempts made to intercept letters sent from the bank in Vengerberg to Yennefer. A disloyal member of the company attempted to sell the sorceress' transaction history, though the bank thwarted this early. The Vivaldi owner refused to investigate, rather drowning the employee while he was drunk in a ditch, then informing the Giancardi Bank in Gors Velen, who told Yennefer.
Hogge association.
Around the start of the 1270s, the Vizima branch began working with the Hogge sisters, who when the bard Dandelion visited, asked him to write a ballad celebrating the bank's founding anniversary. They soon left however to buy land elsewhere in Temeria.

"Like any large city, Vizima also has a branch of the dwarf-owned Vivaldi Bank. It is located in a sturdy building with thick stone walls. Guards armed to the teeth watch the armoured safes, while wealthy clients can count on discreet, professional service. The bank is renowned and so its reputation did not suffer when rumours began circulating of a hostile takeover. Apparently, the bank's owner was having financial problems, and an anonymous investor took advantage."
Vivaldi Bank branch in Vizima was run by Golan Vivaldi in the 13th century until 1270, when it was taken over by humans.
There also happens to be a second entrance to the bank, located in the storehouse next door.
Associated quests.
In Vergen, Geralt meets Igor Vivaldi, an employee of the Vivaldi's Bank on business in town, checking on the local mine's profitability.
He tells Geralt that each of the bank's agents have been given instructions that the witcher is to receive unlimited credit.

The branch of the Vivaldi Bank encountered in Novigrad allows Geralt to exchange florens and orens for crowns. The bank also allows Geralt to take out loans, although the previous loan must be paid back before a new loan can be taken out.
The Novigrad branch is run by Vimme Vivaldi.
The bank can be found in Novigrad in the main square with the market, just west of the Hierarch Square signpost. The building has a pair of large coin shaped signs hanging in front.

&lt;/infobox&gt;Free Elves is the final quest in Chapter IV. It is triggered after Geralt receives Aerondight from the Lady of the Lake and sets up his first encounter with White Rayla.
Walkthrough.
This quest is Geralt's final chance to side with the Scoia'tael, the Order or go his own way and choose the Witcher / neutral path. After conquering Dagon on Black Tern Island and receiving Aerondight, the witcher heads back to the mainland. Upon reaching the landing, he is met first by Alvin and then by White Rayla. With Alvin, Geralt gets a chance to impart one last piece of advice.
White Rayla has led a group of knights and scouts from the Order to Murky Waters in her hunt for the elven refugees. She warns the witcher that there will be dire consequences if he has decided to side with the elves, but gives him a chance to speak with them to convince them of the futility of their stand. Having warned him, she assures Geralt that she will hold her men off until he returns with his findings.
Geralt then heads to the village.
On the way he meets an Order footman, White Rayla's adjutant, who tells the witcher that the Order does not trust Rayla as they do the witcher. He asks Geralt to side with the Order to prevent a massacre like the one in the Outskirts which was brought on by ravenous beasts, monsters.
Just outside the village, he meets Dandelion who fills in a few more details of the hostage-taking situation in the village. He tells the witcher that Alvin is among the hostages. They discuss things a bit more and decide to both go into town: the witcher to speak with Toruviel and Dandelion to hide and watch from a safe distance.
In town, Geralt first encounters a Scoia'tael commando who fills him in on that faction's stance.
Dandelion then says he will wait for Geralt to tell him what to do.
Dandelion then insists that the witcher not make any decisions before speaking to him.
Geralt then speaks with Alvin who is obviously frightened and grappling with his ability to hear the thoughts of the people around him - not very nice thoughts at all. The witcher tries to explain things to the boy and this provides some small measure of reassurance.
Finally, Geralt gets a chance to speak with Toruviel who emerges from one of the huts. The latter explains that she can not release any of the hostages as the Order is merciless and such a move would give them the opening they need to come in and massacre the elves. Our hero insists on taking Alvin with him and Toruviel relents (or not, again, earlier choices). The witcher then goes to discuss the situation with Dandelion, whom Toruviel has already discerned in the shadows. She points out that this is a very good way for the bard (or "that singer") to get shot and that he is fooling no one.
Our hero and the bard confer and Geralt makes his decision.
Dandelion agrees to find the Fisher King to secure transport back to Vizima and wait for the witcher at the landing.
Dandelion agrees to help.
Dandelion agrees to find the Fisher King to secure transport back to Vizima and wait for the witcher at the landing.
Geralt is about to leave the village with Alvin when the Order ambushes the elves, contrary to what White Rayla had assured:
The witcher sees the injustice and leaps to the defense of his allies. The Order attacks and Geralt must kill them in order to be able to get out of the village.
The witcher helps the Order kill the elves to prevent a second massacre like the one in the Outskirts and be able to leave the village.
The elves interpret the witcher's presence as collusion with the Order. Both sides fight each other and are also hostile to the Witcher if he is near them (and he may stay to kill everyone).
In the frenzy, Alvin is left cowering, alone, and it is not long before his self-preservation instincts kick in. Much to the exasperation of our hero, the child teleports himself out of danger, but where to? There is no time to do anything as the battle is raging around him, and what could he do anyway? Geralt has no idea where Alvin could have gone and no way to find out. Ever pragmatic, the witcher "finishes things" in the village and finding nothing of importance in the aftermath of the battle, makes his way to the landing to find Dandelion.
On the way, he encounters Rayla again and demands to know what just happened. She explains that it was none of her doing. Her men mutinied, her own adjudant producing a letter from Siegfried himself stripping her of her command.
Rayla knows that Geralt sided with the elves and is none too happy about it. She tells him he has made an enemy.
Geralt tells Rayla that she should get out of there.
Geralt tells Rayla that he and Dandelion are headed to Vizima, but there is no room for the likes of her on board.
Geralt finally finds Dandelion and they head back to Vizima courtesy of the Fisher King and his boat. End of Chapter IV and end of quest.

Phases.
To the Village.
Rayla and the knights of the Order were chasing a group of Scoia'tael and ended up here. It appears that the fugitives and the local elves have taken some hostages in the village. I must speak with Toruviel. Can I trust Rayla? She promised to hold the soldiers back for now. "I must go to the village and speak with Toruviel."
Dandelion.
Dandelion is incapable of holding his tongue. He's trying to convince me not to get involved. He wants to meet me after I speak with Toruviel, before I make any decisions. I must speak with Toruviel before I decide.
 That she-elf is stubborn as a mule! Talking to her was a waste of time. I must speak with Dandelion, decide what to do. "I should talk to Dandelion and decide what to do."
Toruviel is clearly scared. I don't know if I can help the elves. I should talk to Dandelion, decide what to do. "I should talk to Dandelion and decide what to do."
Helping the Elves / Helping the Order / Neutrality.
I told Dandelion that I intend to help the elves against the Order. He'll be waiting for me by the Fisher King's hut. "I intend to help the elves against the Order." (3000 XP)
I told Dandelion that I intend to help the Order against the elves. He'll be waiting for me by the Fisher King's hut. "I intend to help the Order against the elves." (3000 XP)
Dandelion is right. I refuse to get involved. I'll grab Alvin and we'll flee to Vizima. I agreed to meet the poet at Fisher King's hut. "I refuse to meddle in this conflict. I'm leaving." (3000 XP)
After the Fight.
I made my choice and sealed it in blood - the blood of all who chose to oppose me. There is no going back now... "The fight is over. I need to grab Dandelion and leave this place."
The Adjutant.
It appears that Rayla did not go back on her word. Based on a secret order, the adjutant has stripped her of her command. Let's assume I believe her. "I must sail to Vizima now."
Vizima.
Dandelion and I are returning to Vizima. I wonder what awaits us there. "Dandelion and I are returning to Vizima." (7000 XP)

Alvin, the quest, begins in Chapter IV when Geralt finds the boy a third time (the first being in the Outskirts, then later at St. Lebioda's Hospital). It is during this quest that Alvin and the witcher get to know each other.
Walkthrough.
When he first steps foot in the village of Murky Waters, the first person Geralt meets is not a resident of the Lakeside but none other than his best friend and celebrated bard, Dandelion. It appears that Triss not only teleported the witcher to the sleepy village, but also the troubadour at the end of Chapter III.
Dandelion fills the witcher in on what has happened since he left the Trade Quarter and reveals the reason for their sudden appearance in this lovely but seemingly irrelevant little hamlet: Alvin is here! Yes, "that" Alvin and he is being cared for by a local woman, Alina. So our hero sets off the find Alvin and make sure he is all right.
As it turns out, he is. He is not just all right, he is happy, well except for being plagued by nightmares that leave him shaken and barely able to breathe. But Triss has thought of this. Before she sent Dandelion along to meet Geralt, she entrusted him with a letter for Geralt and a parcel for Alvin. The parcel contains a dimeritium amulet which is meant to keep Alvin's dreams at bay and keep his burgeoning magical abilities in check.
It takes a little convincing, but Alvin does agree to wear the amulet, but it is not nearly powerful enough to do what Triss hoped it would, or Alvin's abilities are far greater than she thought. Either way, this tactic does not have the intended effect. Alvin continues to have nightmares, but he generally stays in good spirits as he now gets to follow a real witcher around.
As they roam the area together, the two have quite a few discussions about the world, Alvin's dreams and abilities, witchers and elves. Whether he likes it or not, the witcher finds himself drawn into Alvin's life and caring about the boy, and possibly worse: giving advice.
At the end of the chapter, the Order of the Flaming Rose swoops in on the village, intent on making the villagers pay for harbouring elven fugitives. It is during this confrontation that Alvin once again disappears, but this time of his own volition.
Phases.
Alvin.
Dandelion told me that a peasant woman named Alina took Alvin in! I have to find him and talk to him. How did he end up here...? Obviously, Dandelion went straight to the inn." I must find Alvin and talk to him."
A Bucolic Scene.
I managed to find Alvin. He seems to be in good hands, though I could be wrong. I'll take a look around, try to learn more about Alvin's guardians. "I should speak with Julian."
The Family.
Alina made a good impression, but the truth is I know more about monsters than I do about humans. I'm sure Dandelion has been gossiping away with the locals and can tell me more. "I should talk to Dandelion about Alvin's new family."
The Amulet.
Left Alvin with Shani earlier:
Dandelion remembered that Shani gave him a letter for me and that Triss provided a dimeritium amulet for Alvin. I should give the pendant to the boy as quickly as possible. Last time I saw him he was in Alina's house. He should be somewhere in the village. "I must give Alvin the dimeritium amulet."
Left Alvin with Triss earlier:
Dandelion remembered that Triss gave him a letter for me and a dimeritium amulet for Alvin. I should give the pendant to the boy as soon as possible. Last time I saw him he was in Alina's house. He should be around." I must give Alvin the dimeritium amulet."
By the River or Small Ruins.
If Geralt left Alvin with Shani:
Alvin likes to spend time on the riverbank near the village. As pastoral as the landscape seems, it could still be a dangerous area. I should find Alvin before he gets into trouble. "I should look for Alvin on the riverbank near the village."
By the River.
If Geralt left Alvin with Triss:
Alina claims that Alvin often plays by the ruins near the village. "I should look for Alvin by the ruins near the village."
A Prophecy.
If Geralt left Alvin with Shani:
I found Alvin on the riverbank near the village. Before I gave him the amulet, the boy prophesied again. Maybe the amulet will give him more control over his powers... Now that I've done what Triss asked, I can tend to other matters. "Alvin is safe. I can focus on other matters."
If Geralt left Alvin with Triss:
I found Alvin among the ruins near the village. Before I gave him the amulet, the boy prophesied again. Maybe the amulet will give him more control over his powers... "Now that I've done what Triss asked, I can tend to other matters."
Witchers.
Option 1:
I told Alvin that no one can become a witcher now that none remain who can complete the mutations. The boy is both curious and smart. I wonder what will become of him... "I told Alvin that becoming a witcher is impossible now that none remain who can complete the mutations." (1000 XP) 
Option 2:
I told Alvin that becoming a witcher involves suffering and pain. The boy is both curious and smart. I wonder what will become of him... "I told Alvin that becoming a witcher involves suffering and pain." (1000 XP) 
Option 3:
I told Alvin he should be a knight rather than a witcher. The kid is both smart and curious. I wonder what will become of him... "I told Alvin he should become a knight rather than a witcher." (1000 XP)
Destiny.
Option 1:
I told Alvin that we forge our own fate. The kid needs some guidance. I'll look after him for the time being. He follows me around everywhere... "I told Alvin that we are masters of our own fate." (1000 XP) 
Option 2:
I told Alvin that his powers are a gift. It seems the boy needs some guidance. I'll look after him for the time being. He follows me around everywhere... "I told Alvin that his powers are a gift." (1000 XP)
Option 3:
I told Alvin that people don't understand his gift and that he should keep it hidden. (1000 XP) 
New Information.
Berengar told me about his ties to Salamandra. He worked with them out of fear. Apparently, Salamandra is looking for Alvin. I'll leave Berengar alone for now. Maybe we'll talk again later. "I learned some interesting facts. Maybe I can talk to Berengar again later."
The Fisher King.
I think the Fisher King wants to see me. I wonder why... "I should go see the Fisher King."
The Lady of the Lake.
The Fisher King said that the Lady of the Lake wishes to see me. I have to go to Black Tern Island. "I should go to Black Tern Island and speak with the Lady of the Lake."
A Gift.
An extraordinary sword... The Lady of the Lake must think me important. "The Lady of the Lake... She was worth seeing... " (2000 XP + Aerondight)
Nonhumans.
Option 1:
Alvin was captured by elves. I have to rescue him. He wouldn't stop asking questions. I told him that the elves are fighting for their freedom, they have no choice. I need to speak with Toruviel. "I must speak with Toruviel." (1000 XP)
Option 2:
Alvin was captured by elves. I have to rescue him. He wouldn't stop asking questions. I told him that the elves are a relic of the past and they refuse to accept this. I need to speak with Toruviel. "I must speak with Toruviel." (1000 XP)
Option 3:
Alvin was captured by elves. I have to rescue him. He wouldn't stop asking questions. I told him that behind their beautiful masks, elves harbor a deep hatred for humans in their hearts. I need to speak with Toruviel. "I need to speak with Toruviel." (1000 XP)
Alvin's Disappearance.
Alvin disappeared in a teleport born of his untamed magical abilities and his fear. I couldn't stop him and now I've lost track of him. I was supposed to protect him... "Alvin was terrified and teleported away during the fight. I doubt I'll find him."
To Vizima.
Amidst the confusion of the fight, Alvin disappeared in a flash of magic energy. I have no idea where to look for the boy. We failed miserably, Dandelion and I... We should return to Vizima - maybe that's where he landed, maybe someone has seen him. "Alvin has disappeared. I must return to Vizima and look for him." (5000 XP)

<doc id="2581" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2581" title="Modding">
Modding

First and foremost, if you decide to indulge in a bit of modding for "The Witcher", you will need the D'jinni Adventure Editor. Luckily, it is included with the game and does not require a separate download or purchase. It is also advisable to check out the D'jinni wiki for much more detailed information on how to use the editor.
Requirements.
This article contains information about modding "The Witcher". It assumes that:
Modding in general.
In general, modding a game means following this "waterfall" model:
"The Witcher" is no different — the same model can be applied.
Modding "The Witcher".
The nature of the beast.
Modding "The Witcher" seems to be easy but limited.
Easy meaning that it is very easy to replace game files with modified ones.
Limited meaning that adding new content is not very straightforward since the game has been built to tell one story. This will hopefully change with future patches and the release of official modding tools.
For this reason, this article covers only the modification of game files for now.
Modding a single file.
To pick the file you want to modify, take a look at the file formats. You will also find the tools there to modify the files. Once you are done with your modification, you need to make sure that the game loads it. If you have modified a resource in a &lt;samp&gt;BIF&lt;/samp&gt; file, just drop it in the &lt;samp&gt;\DATA&lt;/samp&gt; directory (or, in any directory under it). If you have modified a file (that is not in a &lt;samp&gt;BIF&lt;/samp&gt; file), unfortunately you need to overwrite the original, so be sure to make a backup before you do so. Once the modified file is in the right place, start "The Witcher" and see your modifications in action.
DDS format.
Most of the textures in "The Witcher" are in &lt;samp&gt;DDS&lt;/samp&gt; format (or "Direct Draw Surface"). To view them in the Windows Explorer you will need the DDS Thumbnail Viewer from Nvidia. But be aware, this application uses a lot of resources. If you just want to view them in a separate window, download the Windows Texture Viewer.
To edit them, you need some plugins for the following applications:
More information.
For more information about modding "The Witcher", please refer to the .
Tip: Also look into the D'jinni Lab at the official game forums to better understand modding basics.
Things to keep in mind.
Conflicts.
"The Witcher" reads data from the entire &lt;samp&gt;\DATA&lt;/samp&gt; directory. First, it loads resources from the &lt;samp&gt;KEY&lt;/samp&gt;/&lt;samp&gt;BIF&lt;/samp&gt; files, and then it looks for resources from the other files in all sub-directories recursively. This means that if you place a new texture e.g. in &lt;samp&gt;\DATA\newtexture.dds&lt;/samp&gt; and another one in &lt;samp&gt;\DATA\TEST\newtexture.dds&lt;/samp&gt;, you can not be sure which one will be loaded. So, if you are wondering why is it that you do not see the changes you have made, you should make sure that there is only one file with that name under the entire &lt;samp&gt;\DATA&lt;/samp&gt; directory and its sub-dirs.
Toolkit.
CD PROJEKT RED has released the D'jinni Adventure Editor to the community shortly after Patch 1.3, which works in a similar fashion to the Aurora tool set. The community, however, has since levelled some criticism at the developers for not providing sufficient aid in its use as there have been a wealth of new functions and D'jinni is not as intuitive and helpful as Aurora that would mark errors and provide a list of commands.
The Patch 1.4 brings added stability and refinement to the D'jinni as well, but does not do away with the frequent crashes.

<doc id="2582" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2582" title="Extracting the original files">
Extracting the original files

In order to make any real changes to the game or to create your own "The Witcher" mod, the first thing that must be done is to extract the original files.
The process.
All of the data that is used by the game is stored under the &lt;samp&gt;\DATA&lt;/samp&gt; directory. Take a look at it now. You will find a whole slew of files there. Quite a few of the files are unpacked — these are of no interest for now. We are interested in the ones that are packed — the ones with &lt;samp&gt;.BIF&lt;/samp&gt; file extension. The &lt;samp&gt;BIF&lt;/samp&gt; files are containers that "wrap" most of the game data — these are the archives we will want to extract. &lt;samp&gt;BIF&lt;/samp&gt; files alone are useless though, we will need the accompanying &lt;samp&gt;KEY&lt;/samp&gt; files as well, because the &lt;samp&gt;BIF&lt;/samp&gt; files are indexed by &lt;samp&gt;KEY&lt;/samp&gt; files — this mumbo-jumbo is irrelevant for now; if you are interested, read all about it on the KEY BIF V1.1 format page.
At the moment, there are no official tools to extract these files, so we have to rely on third-party applications. These are listed at the bottom of the KEY BIF V1.1 format page, in the external links section. Pick any one of those, and use it to extract any &lt;samp&gt;KEY&lt;/samp&gt;/&lt;samp&gt;BIF&lt;/samp&gt; file you want.
It does not matter which tool you use, you will have to select at least one &lt;samp&gt;KEY&lt;/samp&gt; file that you want to extract. Some tools allow to be more specific, like &lt;samp&gt;UnBIF&lt;/samp&gt; or BIFRip, that allow the extraction of specific &lt;samp&gt;BIF&lt;/samp&gt; files, but in the end you will have to hit an "extract button". Make sure that you extract all files outside of the game directories or they may interfere with the game itself: wasting resources and confusing you with non-working modifications.
The time needed to extract the data depends on how fast your machine is and on the amount of data you plan to extract. I took me a little over seven minutes to extract all data from the game — so do not be surprised.

Game layout

This article describes the directory structure of "The Witcher".
Conventions.
When a path starts with a backslash character ('\'), it means that the installation directory has been omitted from the path. For example, assuming that you have installed the game to the &lt;samp&gt;C:\Program Files\The Witcher&lt;/samp&gt; directory, &lt;samp&gt;\DATA&lt;/samp&gt; would mean &lt;samp&gt;C:\Program Files\The Witcher\DATA&lt;/samp&gt;
Layout.
Once you have completed installation, you will have the following directory structure:
The root, containing a few files.
\DATA.
The &lt;samp&gt;\DATA&lt;/samp&gt; directory contains all game data that will be loaded by the game at some point.
\LAUNCHER.
The &lt;samp&gt;\LAUNCHER&lt;/samp&gt; directory contains a collection of &lt;samp&gt;PNG&lt;/samp&gt; images that are used for localization of the launcher.
The launcher itself is &lt;samp&gt;\LAUNCHER.EXE&lt;/samp&gt;.
\REGISTER.
The &lt;samp&gt;\REGISTER&lt;/samp&gt; directory contains a collection of &lt;samp&gt;PNG&lt;/samp&gt; images and &lt;samp&gt;DLL&lt;/samp&gt;s for localization of the registration tool.
The registration tool itself is &lt;samp&gt;\REGISTER.EXE&lt;/samp&gt;.
\SYSTEM.
The &lt;samp&gt;\SYSTEM&lt;/samp&gt; directory contains several things:

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Mud and Velvet is an optional quest in Chapter V, which is offered to Geralt by Antoinette, a noblewoman who happens to be at the Royal castle when the witcher arrives.
Walkthrough.
Antoinette is a noblewoman from Beauclair in the duchy of Toussaint that Geralt meets after his audience with the king at the Royal castle at the beginning of Chapter V. Her Antoinette's cousins, Buse, Corbin and Ramerot are in hiding in the refugee caves in the swamp cemetery after incurring the disfavour of the king and now they are completely out of orens.
She gives Geralt 900 , 300 for each cousin and begs him to bring the gold to her stranded cousins. In return, each cousin will give Geralt a receipt which can be redeemed by speaking to captain Jean-Pierre. Or Geralt could keep the cash, after all, but then he will have to fight Jean-Pierre and defeat him. For his troubles, he gets a nice sword "and" the cash. He will never see Antoinette again anyway.
Rewards.
No Receipts Returned.
"(After having found one cousin and denying meeting Antoinette, Geralt can speak to Jean-Pierre about this quest. At that point, he will report finding no cousins.)"
Finishing the job.
However poorly Geralt completes this mission, if he still gives Jean-Pierre whatever money is left, he also earns an additional 2000 XP.
Phases.
Money for the Cousins.
I promised a female courtier I would deliver money to her "cousins" who hide in the caves in the swamp. Each must receive 300 orens and give me a receipt.

As Geralt is strolling through the area surrounding the village of Murky Waters, he comes upon a mason, Harn and his son, Pat, who are busily working on a bridge. It looks like they have just started. The witcher strikes up a conversation and it is not long before he learns that all is not as straightforward as it might appear.
It seems that the river is haunted by ghosts who have contacted the mason in his dreams and instructed him to fix the bridge which has fallen into disrepair. Not wanting to anger the spirits, he set himself to the task. But as hard as he works during the day, every night his work is destroyed and he must start anew in the morning.
Harn is convinced that the griggs who frolic around a small shrine, or santon, next to the bridge are responsible for the vandalism. He feels that they consider the bridge and the river to be their "turf" and this is their way of not too subtly "nudging" him out. He asks the witcher if he can help and of course our hero obliges. After all, even monster-slayers need steady income. The mason also adds that the local witch probably knows something about griggs and could offer some options.
So off Geralt goes to see the local witch, who is also the healer, and depending on his choices earlier in the game, might even be Abigail. Regardless, the healer tells him that the griggs require a peace offering in the form of a cat harness which was stolen from them by a rival band of griggs who live in the crypt in the fields. Cat harness? Yes indeed, it appears that griggs harness and ride cats in the same manner that humans harness and ride horses.
The witcher then heads off to the crypt to retrieve the object in question. The crypt is full of nasty beasts: alps, cemetaurs, alghouls, ghouls, fleders and garkains abound. There is even an ancient cemetaur who haunts the deepest, darkest corners of the crypt. So after much hacking and slashing, the witcher finds the santon of the "bad" griggs and retrieves the harness.
He then goes back to see the healer who instructs him to place the harness in the santon of the "good" griggs and wait for their counter-offer. He does as instructed and the griggs offer a four-leaf clover which Geralt in turn gives to the mason as a talisman against further vandalism. The mason is thrilled and offers the witcher three possible rewards: 400 , the book "Specters, Wraiths, and the Damned", or his son's services as an archer during dangerous encounters in the area.
Phases.
The Bridge.
A mason named Harn asked for my help. Some malicious creatures are destroying the bridge he is building. I should ask the healer how to deal with griggs. "I should see a healer and ask her how to deal with griggs."
Underground Griggs.
I need to go to the crypt in the fields. Inside, I'll find a santon belonging to a tribe of underground griggs. I need to find a cat harness there... The healer thinks it will be useful. "I need to take a cat harness from the griggs that live in the crypt and return to the healer's hut."
The Harness.
I have the cat harness for the griggs. I can use it [to] conviince them that the mason has only good intentions. "I have the harness that will win the griggs' favor. I should see the healer." (2000 XP)
The Offering.
I need to place the harness on the santon of the griggs who are annoying Harn. If the griggs are satisfied, they will leave me a token of their friendship. "I have to leave the harness as an offering for the griggs by the bridge."
The Four-Leaf Clover.
The griggs accepted my gift and left me a four-leaf clover in return. I should give it to Harn, who's sure to see it as a good omen. "I must give the four-leaf clover to the mason." (2000 XP)
A Reward.
The mason can now continue working, though I doubt he'll finish the bridge anytime soon. Harn rewarded me for helping him. "I have received my reward." (choice of reward + 4000 XP)

Zerrikania is a vast human realm located to the east of both the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire. Isolated from the westerners by mountain ranges, deserts and wastelands, it is often perceived as a mysterious land of warrior women, dragon cults and exotic beasts.
History.
Early history.
Roots of the modern Zerrikanian realm are found within a great fertile canyon surrounded by steppes and harsh barren plateaus. People of this lush region believed they had been designated by Zerrikanterment, a colossal golden dragon, as his destined to guard and take care of dragons visiting the chasm.
While the canyon population is perceived as the mythological birthplace of the culture, the bulk of the Zerrikanian nation was formed by numerous steppe clans. Led by matriarchs, these warlike amazons dominated the areas around, eventually imposing the matriarchal system within the chasm itself and establishing a monarchy. The traditional protection of dragons turned into worship, with monumental temples hosting these majestic beasts being erected across the realm.
Contact with outside world.
The continuous shrinking of the number of dragons visiting the realm led Saulrenith, a priestess from one of the northern Zerrikanian cities, to propose an expedition to the Northern Realms in order to search for remaining dragons as well as spread their faith. Six priestesses and six warrioresses spent four years roaming the Continent until they were massacred by a dwarven band hunting for a green dragon. The mission's failure prompted Queen Merineaevelth to found the "Faithel": a warrior order tasked with finding and protecting the holy creatures.
The failed expedition and establishment of Faithel increased the interest in an outside world by what was once an isolationist country. Holy warriors were followed by traders, alchemists and inventors, introducing previously unknown goods in Nordling and Nilfgaardian lands. Women unaffiliated with any clan, known as Free Warriors, became a common sight in foreign mercenary bands, eventually leading to the situation when any Zerrikanian warrior woman abroad was mistaken to be a Free Warrior.
Prior to the mid-1100s, the Zerrikanian crown came into contact with witchers that were working as caravan defenders across the infamous Korath desert, which the country used regularly to try and trade with the western part of the continent. Sensing a good opportunity here, the Queen of Zerrikania offered a proposal to these witchers to help build up their schools in exchange for their services to esort their caravans across the desert. This lead to the formal creation of the School of the Manticore and a close relationship between the Zerrikanian crown and the witchers formed. However, in the fall of 1146, what became known as the Day of Fire occured: most of the school's witchers were escorting most of the royal family and court to try and arrange a marriage between the queen's son and the Princess of Metinna when they were met by a towering Fire Elemental. By the time the battle was over, almost all of the witchers were killed, half of the royal family, and a third of the court. The Zerrikanians shunned the witchers after this and doubled their efforts to find a safer sea route to the west.
By the second half of the 13th century, trade routes were established and western travelers began to roam Zerrikanian lands, returning with many vague or exaggerated tales.
Dissidents and mercenaries.
In the second half of the 13th century, the ruling Queen of Zerrikania was a sorceress of bad renown outside her realm. She was forced to rely on foreign mercenaries in chasing dissidents dangerous to her rule. One of them, Borch Three Jackdaws, was in fact a golden dragon himself in secret.
Zerrikania did not partake in the Northern Wars thus making it a destination of refugees, including Sigismund Dijkstra, Isengrim Faoiltiarna, and Boreas Mun. However, the realm suffered its own civil wars, fought over the humid, forested regions. Several mercenary bands looking for a job after the Battle of Brenna, including Clan Tuirseach warriors and the famed Kovirian Free Company led by Julia Abatemarco, took part in the conflict. The side supported by mercenaries took heavy loses as the foreigners, unprepared for local dangers, suffered from diseases and predatory fauna. Their native opponents took advantage from familiarity with jungle landscape and succesively won skirmish after skirmish without the mercenaries being able to even locate the enemy. After eight months of war, the foreigners were forced to retreat. The Nordlings who returned home were voluntarily accompanied by Zerrikanian exiles.
Geography and climate.
Zerrikania is situated between the Fiery Mountains to the north and Great Korath Desert in the south. It can be reached from the Elskerdeg Pass through the famed Wastelands.
Descending from the mountains, one would first enter the thick, primeval forest, only to eventually cross it and reach dry steppes, deserts and of the Continent's interior. One such plateau is "broken" by a huge canyon up to 3 km deep. The canyon is basically a gigantic oasis hosting a unique microclimate due to its shadow's cooling effect and multiple sources of freshwater, often in form of waterfalls. All of this makes the growth of rainforest possible and provides habitats for several exotic creatures as well as human settlements. The distance from one end of the gorge to the other is 5 days of journey.
Fauna and flora.
Zerrikania has two distinct forest systems, one adjacent to the mountains and another down in the canyon. The canyon's rainforests comprise of several plants, some of which are almost impossible to find outside apart from Brokilon Forest. One can encounter exotic trees with large juicy fruits and flowered climber vines as well as plants that are poisonous or otherwise dangerous. Outside the forests, the vegetation is sparse.
The realm hosts a number of unique animals in its varied areas, including tigers, antelopes, ostriches, jackals, snakes, camels, leopards, and colored birds of prey. Monsters that may be encountered include venomous basilisks and spiders so large so they can trap elephants in their webs. One should also be vary of tse tse flies which lay eggs within human bodies.
Society.
Demographics.
Zerrikanian society is comprised of a number of ethnicities and races. While humans seem to be prevalent, the national language is at least partially derived from Elder Speech and existence of dwarves and other nonhumans is not unheard of.
People are powerfully built, well adapted to harsh environment. Their skin tone ranges from swarthy to black, and their hair from fair to dark. A common practice involves tattoing bodies; each tattoo follows a code, denoting a specific meaning.
Structure of the society.
While not codified by law, the Zerrikanian society is "de facto" matriarchal in nature. By tradition, it's women who hold positions of power – they are clan leaders, priestesses, warriors, and teachers.
Zerrikania is ruled by a Queen, sometimes also translated as Supreme Leader. By default, the position belongs to the inheriting female clan member of the previous Queen. In instances when the successor refuses assuming the position, or when it is hard to determine who should succeed, the new Leader is chosen through popular vote held during People's Assembly: a -like folkmoot where each free Zerrikanian woman can submit a candidacy and cast a vote. The person elected starts a new royal line and her descendants inherit the throne once she dies.
Zerrikanian men mostly comprise a caste known as "Worenkenni". The "Worenkenni" do communal and domestic work, such as land cultivation, mining, woodwork, and fishing. It's men who are tasked with raising children: girls up to 4 and boys up to 10. "Worenkenni" are also teachers of culturally masculine jobs, and sometimes become respected sages.
Culture.
Language and writing system.
The sole official language is Zerrikanian, a heavily distorted dialect of Elder Speech. It's the only one known by all Zerrikania's inhabitants; only priestesses and "Faithel" learn Common or Nilfgaardian.
The written form of Zerrikanian is runic.
Education.
As a free Zerrikanian child reaches 4, she or he usually becomes helping parent of suitable gender in their work. As they reach 10, children become baptised in the name of Zerrikanterment; from now on, they turn from passive observers into active participants of Zerrikanian social life. They choose the job they would like to take care of and learn it for at least five years; each year, they can change the area of studies, but as they reach 15 they are obliged to decide for good. Girls between 10 to 15 are called "Cule" and boys "Laireani"; as they reach 15, they become "Cule mailteini" and "Laireani mailten" respectively, and begin practices in their chosen way of life until they are ready.
Those, who choose the life of warrior or of priestess, have to train longer to become full-fledged members of the profession.
Religion.
The only religion recognized by state is cult of Divine Dragons. It comprises of a "pantheon" of various ancient wyrms as well as veneration of real, living specimens hosted in temples. Foreigners often speak about the sacrifices performed before the images of these scaled overlords. Notable entities worshipped include Zerrikanterment, Baal-Zebuth, and Raróg.
The position of the state-mandated form of worship is contested by growing cult of Lilit-Niya, a syncretic religion mixing ancient Wozgor beliefs with eastern spirituality. Its matriarchal character swayed many women across the country and the elites, making Zerrikania a true center of the religion.
Magic, alchemy and medicine.
Magic in Zerrikania is practiced mostly by priestesses. Becoming one takes eight years, during which adepts learn the arcana of dragon magic, reading and writing Elder Runes, decipher legends and mysteries written in ancient chronicles, and become accustomed with herbalism and alchemy.
Alchemy is one of arts practiced by both women and men. Along with various other recipies, Zerrikanian wizards and sect members became known as specialists in the usage of explosives. Used to create bombs or siege engines, substances developed by Zerrikanian masters were eventually brought to Nilfgaard and Northern Realms during 12th or 13th century.
Zerrikanian knowledge and ingredients find its uses in medicine as well. One of the characteristic elements of local practices is .
Warfare and weapon smithery.
Like other steppe nations, Zerrikanians specialize in mounted archery and sabremanship. Their legendary marksmanship skills are the topic of legends and superstitions across the Continent; a common myth amongst those uneducated with bowmanship claims that Zerrikanian amazons cut a single breast in order for it not to interfere with their aim.
While the renowned "Faithel" order is the most characteristic, most Zerrikanian armed women belong to steppe guardians – clans' retinues protecting borders. These warrioresses train in extremal conditions, learn camouflage and aquire knowledge about plants and animals. They wear two lines of the tattoo and the "chameleon" symbol: two vortexes conjoined in "8" shape tattoed below ears.
Yet another example of Zerrikanian amazons are the Free Warriors: swearing alegiance neither to the clan or the queen, they are often found in mercenary groups of the Continent. Their renown is high; Nordlings seeing "Faithel" often assume they deal with Free Warriors.
Zerrikanians are known for their production of zefhars enforced with antelope horns and saberras, a type of saber native to Zerrikania. The most destructive, however, are fire scorpions: siege engines shooting green fire, a couple of such combined being capable of razing entire cities. Some even say it's these machines that caused the desertification of Zerrikania ages ago.
Economy and trade.
In the steppe and the desert, most Zerrikanians are herders, living off the milk and meat their animals produce. In areas with a more favourable climate, the more sedentary lifestyle is possible, allowing a portion of the population to produce goods other than basic foods.
Most of the Continent knows Zerrikania only through the products imported from there; it is hard to determine however which ones are produced in Zerrikania, and which ones are merely sold by Zerrikanian traders after being bought in even farther lands. Some of the wares commonly associated with Zerrikania are spices and silk. They arrive in Northern Realms either via land route through Elskerdeg Pass and Aedirn, or by sea, presumably from ports in Nilfgaardian Empire or in the lands south of the Korath.
One of the biggest importers from Zerrikania is the Nordling-owned Zerrikanian Spice Company, headquartered in Novigrad where ships with Zerrikanian products often dock. Some northern organizations even have branches in Zerrikania itself, with Bank of Cianfanelli family being one of the most prestigious.

"The Witcher".
Zerrikania is not visited in the game, but it is acknowledged as the home for the formulae of bombs, and famous for its alchemists.
"Zerrikania, home of the venomous Basilisk, has given birth to other equally hideous creatures. Among them are spotted spiders so huge that they trap elephants in their webs and the no-less terrifying tse tse flies. The flies are especially repulsive, laying their eggs in the human body, the resulting larvae maturing within the host's head. The victim's brain serves as sustenance and when the larvae turn into adult flies, they leave the body through the eye sockets, now void of the previously devoured eyes."

Triss' house

Triss' house is in the affluent Trade Quarter. When she is in Vizima, she uses an elegantly appointed home on John Natalis Square. Her home also doubles as her workplace which is witnessed by the interesting devices and numerous books found there. Notably, there is a magic mirror which functions as both a teleporter and a telecommunicator in Triss' bedroom on the upper floor.
"Triss lives in a corner building on a small square where a statue plinth stands, bereft of its monument. The statue itself, which bore the likeness of an elven philosopher, was recently melted down to make a new bell for the Cloister of the Order of the Flaming Rose. The sorceress has decorated her home very luxuriously, if not extravagantly. There are many expensive devices here, as well as magical components and equipment."

Shani's house

Shani's house is located just adjacent to the market area known as "Merchant Street". The building is owned by Grandma who takes a keen interest in anyone trying to visit the medic. It is also home to Alvin in Chapter III, if Geralt chooses Shani as the boy's guardian.
Whenever Shani is at home, and of course, if Geralt and Shani are on speaking terms, he can stay for free. Shani hangs out there before and after work during Chapter II, and in Chapter III she seems to be permanently in residence, or not speaking to the witcher.
"It's easy to find Shani's home as it's located by a statue of the Rod of Aesculapius. The building is owned by an old lady with a difficult personality — one has to curry favor with her to get inside."

Safe house

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The safe house is offered as a refuge by one of the few citizens who have not fled when Geralt is caught up in the street-fighting which has taken over the Temple Quarter in the Epilogue. Inside, he finds a host of familiar faces here, some of whom bear information about the situation in Vizima and others who speak of Destiny.
"A special place, this house has become a shelter for many people fleeing the war. They differ in terms of status, views and walks of life, yet they have all found peace and safety here, amidst other refugees, while fires rage and fighting continues in the streets of Vizima. Those here are obviously not aware that this temporary haven can become a trap."

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Celina was Tobias Hoffman's elder daughter. She was jealous of her younger sister Alina, who was getting married to Julian, a wealthy merchant from Kovir.
Before the wedding, Celina tried to get revenge on her sister by "having" the witcher, whom she felt her sister would naturally snatch from her. She told Geralt that she would have him on the nearest rock and demanded a ring, "as nice as Alina's" for this tryst.
Celina ultimately met a tragic end at the hands of Adam, her sister's lover (not her sister's fiancé!), ending up cursed to be a nightwraith. She argued about Julian with Alina and the argument spiraled into manslaughter as Celina pushed her sister who hit her head on a rock as she fell and was killed. Adam was overcome with grief and anger when he learnt of this and killed Celina to avenge his beloved.
Poor Alina also returned, as a noonwraith, due to the circumstances of her death at the hands her sister. If only their love for each other was as great as their love of themselves, one wonders if this tale may have had a different ending...
As a nightwraith, she roamed the Fields at night until her spirit could be put to rest. Geralt can encounter her in that form several times, if he also wanders the fields at night. Each time, she laments her fate:
"It was an accident! I had no wish to kill but my anger bested me.""I fear the night, I always have... woe is me!""All I wanted was love... She had only disdain for him, scorning his feelings. I never would have done so..."
Then she attacks and must be killed. This continues to happen until her spirit is allowed to move on, which can not happen without the Wreath of Immortelles, which Geralt can get in return for completing a quest for the Hermit.
Having been set free, she disappears. She does return, however, depending on choices made by Geralt regarding his path. If he chooses the Witcher / neutral path, she appears, still as a nightwraith, to help him (or possibly fight him) in the Ice Plains.
"Seems like Tobias Hoffman's elder daughter is jealous of her little sister Alina, who is getting married..."

Clerks

Clerks are a privileged caste in Vizima because they make many important decisions. This is one of the few professions which both entails a measure of power and is open to women.
Romance.
To obtain this romance card, you should visit the upper floor of the City hall armed with a diamond. Seek out a clerk willing to be a "naughty girl" and turn on the famous witcher charm, just don't ask her to marry you.
Once you have obtained the romance card from the Clerk she can be heard complaining about her back.

&lt;/infobox&gt;
A Nordling is an inhabitant of the Northern Kingdoms on the Continent, belonging to human cultures dominant in those realms. It is a colloquialism often applied to Northerners by Nilfgaardians from the southern regions of the Empire, and by the Ofiri, but rarely used by the populace of the North themselves.
History.
The ancestors of Nordlings came to the Continent during the Landings, beginning with the Landing of the Exiles around the 760s. Though relatively small in number at the beginning, thanks to their military art and fertility they managed to conquer the land belonging to the Elder Races in a few centuries. At the height of their range, Nordlings had states from the Kestrel and Dragon Mountains in the north to possibly even Ebbing in the south – the southernmost known area where the Common Speech is the main language.
Their might began to vanish in the 13th century, when the armies of the Nilfgaardian Empire started the so-called Northern Wars, ultimately conquering almost every land south of the Yaruga.
At the time when "Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi" is written, several centuries after the Northern Wars, the Common Speech is considered an endangered or even dead language, though some realms like Cidaris are still referred to as the "Northern Kingdoms".
Physical description.
Being a mix-up of several waves of settlers and native nonhuman societies, Nordlings can have various physical traits. They are tall and short, skinny and muscular, slim and stocky. Their hair color varies as well: black, blond, brown and red occurring most often. People of elven heritage sometimes have more unique hair or eye color, e.g. ashen or purple. Nordling skin color is described either as are pale or swarthy, depending on the location. Seaside cities seem to have a more diverse population, likely due to contacts with the Empire and oversea countries.
Society.
Structure of the society.
Nordlings live in a feudal society and their lands are shredded between several kings and dukes. They are mostly agricultural society, running several farmlands providing food for cities and the nobility. Folks living near the sea or rivers often deal with fishing or aquaculture. Industry is less important, and is often left to mages, like those of Rissberg, or assimilated nonhumans, most often gnomes and dwarves.
Weapon laws.
Most Nordlings own and bear weapons. Even in some capital cities people bear arms, to the extent that "everyone in Vizima bears a weapon" can be said. People bring weapons even during cultural events, and those who cannot afford buying proper arms, like peasants, use scythes, kitchen knives and other dangerous tools. Exceptions can be found, like in the case of Kerack, where entering the Upper City is permitted only after leaving your weapons in the guardhouse.
Forms of discrimination.
In contrast to the Nilfgaardians or Aen Elle, Nordlings do not practice slavery. Unfortunately, in several lands the situation of peasants or nonhumans is often not an enviable as they are forced to deal with everyday classism or xenophobia, as well as strict rules, giving them lesser rights than upper classes. For example, only the pureblood nobility can enter cities during the nights, while commoners or people of even a small percentage of nonhuman genes are dissallowed.
Racial tensions sometimes grow so high they culminate in mass-pogroms. Among the human groups themselves the racism seems to be rare, with an exception in case of the Rivians living outside of their land who are mockingly referred to as "Rivs" and widely perceived as robbers and thugs. In 1252, Geralt of Rivia was mistakenly recognized as a Rivian and attacked by Vizimans in The Fox.
Witchers are the outcasts of the society; perceived as unholy mutants, not so better than the monsters they fight, these warlocks often face mistrust and hostility from people they protect.
Mages and clergy.
Mages generally sit in high positions in Nordling society. Members of the Brotherhood, whether masters or practicing dwimveandras, are warmly welcome both in rural areas and metropolises. The most renowned sorcerers and sorceresses serve as advisors to monarchs. Many cities and towns have their own resident mages who live in towers providing magic assistance and selling magical items. Anti-magic sentiments arise rarely, the most famed and bloody being the witch hunts lasting from 1272 to 1276.
Another privileged group is the clergy. Several cults, differing in rules and commandments, arose around the vast pantheon of deities and divine powers, and priests and priestesses are often respected members of the society, whether as isolated monks and reverends in small rural parishes, or archpriests and hierarchs in vast metropolises. Druids, somehow in between priests and mages, are important as well, though regarded as more mysterious and quite anachronistic. They often take care of ecological issues such as overfishing or forest clearing.
Women's rights and sexual minorities.
The situation of women's role in society varies throughout the realms. There are several successful warrioresses, priestesses or sorceresses, but there are as well many cases when a young maiden is forced by the family to marry an unwanted person (to do justice though, several young men are forced as well). While the decision to abort is for the most part considered as an indefeasible right, Belohun had tried to force through anti-abortion rights in Kerack, but his advisor sorceress Lytta Neyd convinced him to change his mind.
The Nordlings seem to be rather liberal in views on non-heterosexual relationships since bi- or homosexual affairs are popular and perceived as normal among the mages. Exceptions however exist, and at least a number of people perceive non-heterosexual couples as "perverted".
Culture.
Language and writing systems.
Based on the languages of the various groups of colonists and nonhumans, Nordlings developed their own tongue, called the Common Speech or Common Tongue. It consists of a couple of dialects and so people from the different parts of the Northern lands are often easily recognized because of their accent.
Two writing systems are in use, First Runes and the modern alphabet.
Education.
In most of the Nordling lands, education is a domain of the upper classes – it's hard to attend university unless one has wealthy or influential family. This isn't the case when it comes to the academies of magic or temple schools, which provide knowledge for everyone with talent and willingness.
One of the known exceptions is a program of state education started by Griffin of Temeria, who founded the chain of free three-year elementary schools called "griffinettes".
Art.
Their paintings are often mentioned as respected art. Rulers often have their own court painters, and galleries of paintings can be found in universities, magical academies, temples, and other places.
Arts like music, poetry, and storytelling are the domain of bards, sometimes called minstrels or troubadours; wayfaring men and women who make a living from singing tales, whether on noble courts or during rural festivals. An annual tournament of troubadours is held in Castle Vartburg each autumn.
Religion.
Nordlings believe in and follow a vast amount of deities they call "Immortal Ones", divine powers, popular prophets, saints and heroes, as well as several minor powers or idols like the sacred unicorn, worshipped by country dwellers from the Unicorn village. They are polytheistic, but the temples are devoted only to the certain beings.

Intro mod

This is a DIY (do-it-yourself) mini-mod.
The intro/outro movies are governed by the script in: 
&lt;samp&gt;\DATA\SCRIPTS\MOVIES.LUA&lt;/samp&gt;
If you only have &lt;samp&gt;\DATA\SCRIPTS\MOVIES.LUC&lt;/samp&gt;, you have a compiled version.
Compiled scripts have the &lt;samp&gt;.LUC&lt;/samp&gt; extension and can be decompiled using any utility that is listed in the LUC format article under the .
&lt;samp&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;}
&lt;samp&gt;&lt;/samp&gt;}
This way, only the title screen will be displayed — no need to wait for loading each movie and now we need to press the Esc-key only once if we wanted to skip it.
 Or you can use &lt;samp&gt;"CS_BLOCKEND"&lt;/samp&gt;instead of &lt;samp&gt;"cs_title"&lt;/samp&gt; to remove all intros completely.

Altar of Melitele

There are several altars to Melitele in "The Witcher", but only two that are usable:
In St. Lebioda's Hospital, there is a novice nun praying by the altar, who can tell you about Melitele. She will also tell you about sacrifices to the goddess.
Sacrifices.
Acceptable sacrifices: Any kind of food, including meat, which is surprising since a nun in St. Lebioda's Hospital indicates that Melitele does not appreciate killing done in her name.
The first sacrifice will give you three of the Sephirot: Ghe'vrath, 'Oth, Veen'ah. You will need these for the A Mysterious Tower and Monoliths tower quests. After this, every subsequent sacrifice will give you Mistletoe, an alchemical ingredient.

Vizima Confidential is basically the framing quest for Chapter II of "The Witcher". It spawns and is fed by several other quests in that chapter of the story.
Walkthrough.
In this quest, with the help of the local private investigator Raymond Maarloeve, Geralt will need to indulge himself in a lot of investigative works to hopefully uncover the real identity of the man behind local Salamandra activities, as well as unearthing the truth regarding the possible collaboration with Salamandra for a total of 6 suspects:
Early investigations.
This quest starts after Geralt decided to visit a local private investigator recommended by Siegfried, Raymond Maarloeve. After all, the witcher just barely regained his freedom in an unfamiliar city, with the only suspect being the head of the local law enforcement. He could definitely use an experienced helping hand.
From the detective Geralt learns that the city guard recently arrested a man wearing Salamander pins, the so-called Crown Witness. Needless to say, an interrogation could prove extremely valuable to the investigation effort. Now the witcher just needs to find out where the city guard is holding the prisoner.
Following the quest The Crown Witness to its completion, the witcher now has two new leads: Ramsmeat and Kalkstein.
Reporting back what he just found out, Geralt follows Raymond's advice and sets out to gain Kalkstein's trust. Geralt can also investigate on Ramsmeat and with proper preparation (having beforhand found the 3 clues) deduce his innocence immediately after the conversation with Raymond. After getting the information from the two books requested by Kalkstein during A Mysterious Tower, Geralt figures that the alchemist must trust him enough now. Time to report back again.
Yet this time the witcher finds Raymond under assault by some of Salamandra's best assassins. Geralt intervenes in a heartbeat and saves the detective's life, who then decides to lay low for a bit in light of the attack. Before leaving, he leaves Geralt with a List of suspects, giving our hero three new people to question: Leuvaarden, Thaler and Vivaldi.
After the necessary questioning is done, a messenger boy approaches Geralt, informing him that Raymond would like the witcher to come for a meeting.
It is at this point that the possibilities of the quest really start to emerge - and things get really interesting, too.
Learning the truth.
With Raymond back into the picture, two parallel but not mutually exclusive directions lie ahead of the witcher:
But regardless of what Geralt chose to do next, what really matters is that on either path the witcher learns critical knowledge that topples the entire investigation so far:
"Major Spoiler:" The detective coming out of his lay-low period is not the same one as before, but Azar Javed himself!
For simplicity and accuracy, this critical knowledge will be referred to as the "Grand Truth" from this point.
As the de facto objective of this stage of the investigation, it is best to learn the "Grand Truth" only after clearing most of the suspects (all but Kalkstein) in order to not lose xp. Currently there are 3 ways of achieving this:
If Geralt managed to learn the "Grand Truth" by any means, our hero will have to find a way to lure Azar out of his own territory into a trap. This involves the quest What Lies Beneath, where ironically, the witcher finds himself an ally out of the No.1 suspect: Kalkstein. The two agreed to lure Azar to the tower in the swamp for the final confrontation.
If Geralt didn't realized he's been duped until it's too late, which means the autopsy in Anatomy of a Crime ended up misguided and as a result the witcher has killed Ramsmeat, then Geralt will be informed that in order to get to Kalkstein, he will have to lure the alchemist to the tower in the swamp.
Either way, the quest enters its final stage: the opening of the tower.
Opening the tower.
With the investigation finished, Geralt must now gain access to the tower in the swamp in order to lure the person he believes to be the culprit behind Salamandra activities around Vizima. This calls for the completion of A Mysterious Tower.
After the tower is open to the world once again, Geralt meets with the detective at the foot of the tower. Depending on whether did he learn the "Grand Truth", the witcher emerges either as the intellectual superior who sees through his opponent's every scheme, or the utter fool who has been duped to the very end.
As the quest comes to an end, Chapter II of the story concludes as well.
Phases.
The Investigation Begins.
I'm beginning an investigation with the help of the private eye. the goal is to find someone who works for Azar Javed and trace the Salamander boss this way. "I must find someone who works for Azar Javed and trace the Salamander boss through him."
Money for the Detective.
"This only happens if Geralt refuses to mention Azar Javed to Raymond."
To move the investigation forward, I have to get 100 orens for Raymond. "I must get 100 orens for Raymond" (−100 )
Vincent.
I have my first clues about Salamandra. The City Guard is holding an important witness I need to speak to... I should have a word with the jailor Jethro. "I must question the witness being held by the city guards. I should talk to Jethro." (500 XP)
The Witness.
It seems that the Salamanders have a secret agent who set a trap for me. I must find out who he is. First I should interrogate the prisoner being held by the city guards. "I must interrogate the witness."
Conclusion.
I've done some hell of investigator's work. I began uncovering Vincent and I interrogated the witness at the hospital. I found new traces leading to Ramsmeat and Kalkstein. Time to get back to Raymond and summarize our discoveries. "It's time to get back to Raymond and conclude our discoveries." (500 XP)
The Alchemist's Trust.
There is strong evidence against Ramsmeat and the alchemist Kalkstein. Raymond will take care of the former. I must gain the alchemist's trust. In order to do so, I have to get an important assignment from him. "I must go to Kalkstein the alchemist and gain his trust."
The Alchemist's Trust.
I have strong evidence against Ramsmeat and Kalkstein the alchemist. Raymond will deal with the thug and I must gain the alchemist's trust. Best to do that by getting an important assignment from him. "I must gain the trust of Kalkstein the alchemist [to] move the investigation forward."
Conversation with Raymond.
Kalkstein trusts me already. It's time to talk to Raymond and decide how to use this trust. "It's time to talk to Raymond about Kalkstein."
Assault.
A group of Salamander gang members attacked the private investigator! Luckily, I managed to hold them back. I'll see how Raymond is doing. "I want to see how Raymond is doing."
The Suspects.
The private investigator decided to lay low. He gave me a list of suspects - I should uncover them as soon as possible, while Raymond attracts the Salamander's attention. "I must cross-question all the suspects. I'll start with Ramsmeat." ( + 500 XP)
Ramsmeat / Thaler / Declan Leuvaarden.
Ramsmeat:
I spoke with Ramsmeat, but his confession alone is insufficient. To get a full picture I need to interrogate other suspects. "I should question Thaler the fence."
Thaler:
I spoke with Thaler, but his confession alone is insufficient. To get a full picture I need to interrogate other suspects. "I should question the merchant Leuvaarden."
Declan Leuvaarden:
I spoke with Declan Leuvaarden, but his confession alone is insufficient. To get a full picture I need to interrogate other suspects. "I should question Ramsmeat, the boss of the thugs."
Further Interrogations.
I've heard the stories of Leuvaarden and Thaler. Now I need to interrogate the thug to get a full picture. "I need to question Ramsmeat."
I've heard the stories of Ramsmeat and Leuvaarden. Now I need to interrogate the fence to get a full picture. "I need to question Thaler."
I've heard the stories of Ramsmeat and Thaler. Now I need to interrogate the merchant to get a full picture. "I need to question the merchant Leuvaarden."
Contact.
I managed to learn some interesting things about our suspects. Now I must wait for Raymond to contact me. "I must wait for Raymond to contact me." (500 XP)
The Meeting.
Raymond sent a messenger - he wants to meet me as he has gained some new information. I wonder how he will react to my discoveries. "I must meet up with Raymond."
Autopsy or Bluff.
Autopsy path:
Autopsy.
Raymond was not interested in my discoveries - small wonder, there is a newer clue. To move this investigation forward, I must perform an autopsy. The body is probably in the gravedigger's possession and Shani will help me with the autopsy. "I cannot move the investigation forward until I finish the autopsy."
Closer and Closer.
The autopsy explained a lot of things. I am very close now. Time to go to Raymond's house. "Time to go to Raymond's house."
Autopsy Results / Azar Javed + Subterfuge.
Wrong conclusion
Autopsy Results.
Autopsy implicated Kalkstein: I told Raymond about what we found during the autopsy. The evidence points to Kalkstein. "The detective needs some time to analyze the evidence."
Autopsy implicated Ramsmeat: I told Raymond about what we found during the autopsy. The evidence points to Ramsmeat. "The detective needs some time to analyze the evidence."
Right conclusion
Azar Javed.
Autopsy implicated Azar: As a result of the autopsy, I learned that Azar Javed impersonates Raymond. I will go to him, pretend the autopsy proved nothing and see what happens. "I will go to Azar posing as the private eye. I'll pretend the autopsy proved nothing and see what happens."
Subterfuge.
I told "Raymond" that I discovered nothing during the autopsy. I will not tell him that he is Azar. "I must find a way to lure Azar into a trap."
No autopsy is necessary:
Bluff.
There is no need to perform the autopsy. I know that Azar Javed is pretending to be Raymond. I will go to him, pretend the autopsy proved nothing and see what happens. "I'll try to lure Azar, posing as the private eye, into a trap."
Subterfuge.
I told "Raymond" that I discovered nothing during the autopsy. I will not tell him that he is Azar. "I must find a way to lure Azar into a trap."
Duped or Not.
Geralt is in the dark:
The Ramsmeat Contract.
I promised Raymond to eliminate the boss of the Salamander's armed forces - Ramsmeat. I have to prepare well, as he seems to be a tough opponent. "I have to kill Ramsmeat."
Ramsmeat is Dead.
I killed Ramsmeat. Time to report to Raymond. "Time to report to Raymond."
The Tower.
I told Raymond that I had killed Ramsmeat. He is going to wait for me near the tower. "I must lure Kalkstein to the tower in the swamp."
Opening the Tower.
Raymond gave me a Sephirah which forms a part of the key to the tower. All that remains is to take what's inside the tower and we'll get that bastard Kalkstein once and for all. "I have to open the tower."
The Secret Within.
I have found the magic treatise that Kalkstein desired so badly. For years, it lay safely hidden away in the tower in the swamp. Azar is in for an unpleasant surprise. "I must prepare to face Azar Javed."
The Truth Revealed.
It's unbelievable. Azar Javed played me for a fool all this time. He killed Raymond and impersonated him. How could I've been so stupid? "Azar Javed impersonated Raymond." (1500 XP)
Geralt knows the deal:
A Trap.
Azar, who impersonated Raymond, is behind all this. I must lure him into a trap. "I will tell "Raymond" that I killed Ramsmeat."
The Tower.
I told Raymond that I had killed Ramsmeat. He is going to wait for me near the tower. "I must prepare to face Azar."
Fake No More.
Everything is going smoothly. The fake private investigator gave me his Sephirah. Now I can stop pretending. "I must get inside the tower to defeat the false Raymond."
The Secret Within.
I have found the magic treatise that Azar desired so badly. For years, it lay safely hidden away in the tower in the swamp. "I must prepare to face Azar Javed."
Azar's Escape.
I uncovered Azar and his devious trick perfectly. It's a shame that he managed to get away. But, as king Desmond used to say: "there is luck in leisure and if you're born to hang, you won't drown." "I uncovered Azar's ploy, but he managed to get away." (2500 XP)

Lebioda was a prophet whose visions and parables are contained in the "Good Book of Prophet Lebioda's Wisdom". He became legendary for his goodness, wisdom, and modest peaceful ways.
As he became well-known, a cult began to form around him. More and more people started following his teachings with some of them becoming his pupils, as was the case with Saint Plegmund who brought his master's words to Toussaint. He was seen doing miracles, and in short time, his words and deeds converted the whole duchy along with Duchess Caroberta who ordered both a temple in Beauclair and a monument on the west bank of the Sansretour River to be built. Lebioda himself visited Toussaint at least once to hear prayers of the faithful.
His wisdom reached even the edges of the Continent far as Kovir and Poviss where it spread thanks to King Esterad Thyssen's wife, Queen Zuleyka, who lived most of her life according to the prophet's teachings.
He died, eaten by a dragon, which he attempted to stop harassing Kaedweni villagers near Ban Ard. The remains of the prophet, recovered from the feces of the creature, were collected by his students and interned in the sarcophagus in the Novigrad's Great Temple. On some holidays, the faithful are allowed to kiss the relic.
He is not only revered by humans but also by several assimilated dwarves.
Even the Cult of the Eternal Fire follows some of Lebioda's parables.
 The story of how the Prophet Lebioda's bones were recovered is quite amusing, especially when you consider that they are supposedly taken out of his sarcophagus on certain festivities, and the pious given the honor of kissing them. I will for the moment refrain from repeating the story, as tales of combing through dung, even dragon dung, are not very well suited for mealtime conversation.

A Posh Reception is a quest which is given to Geralt by Triss at the beginning of Chapter III. The merchant Declan Leuvaarden is holding a reception at The New Narakort at 18:00 and the witcher is invited. Triss insists that he go and so begins the quest.
Walkthrough.
Geralt wakes up in Triss Merigold's bed, at her home in the Trade Quarter. The last thing he can remember is having fought Azar Javed in the Swamp. She explains that she found him unconscious in the swamp and brought him back to her place to recover. After she has "checked him for internal injuries" (an unofficial sexcapade with no card) and discussed his amnesia, she suddenly remembers that they have been invited to a social function that evening at 18:00 at The New Narakort.
That evening, the witcher presents himself at the banquet which is being held in the facilities on the second story of the inn. There he is met by the sorceress. She tells him not to look so morose and ushers him into the main area where they are greeted by Leuvaarden. She introduces the witcher to Velerad the burgomeister, Thaler (well, re-introduces him) the chief of security, along with Erkyn von Blunt, Count de Wett, and Princess Adda. She then leaves our hero to mingle.
Geralt speaks with everyone again and finds out some interesting information about himself as well as the other party guests. When he speaks with Adda, she conveniently and firmly dismisses de Wett, sending him to fetch wine from as far away as possible. The princess and our hero then converse. He is complimentary at every opportunity and soon she mentions that she would like her current whim fulfilled, but she will not say what it is except that it is food. Geralt must then question Velerad and Thaler again to find out her favorite meal and how to prepare it. (Don't insult her too much during the conversation, otherwise you may miss an opportunity to get full XP.)
Thaler will not speak until Geralt runs an errand for him. He needs a letter which is in a large trunk in the room next door. The witcher heads over and retrieves the letter, but is surprised in the act by a rich merchant. The merchant seems amenable to some alcohol, so perhaps the right tincture would suffice (it does not really matter, this meeting is inconsequential). Then it is back to Thaler with the mysterious note. At that point, the head of security reveals that the princess is particularly partial to catoblepas meat.
Velerad will not speak without some stronger alcohol, vodka seems to be his preference, but any strong alcohol will do. Once the burgomeister is sufficiently liquored up, he tells Geralt that Adda likes her meat raw; a little remnant of her days spent as a striga.
The witcher then asks Triss to conjure a portion of catoblepas meat, rare, which he then presents to the princess. She is pleased and invites him to "discuss politics" in private in her alcove next door. The two meet and as expected have a little roll in the hay. (Geralt can resist a little, "i.e." once but not twice, if sex is his goal, but refusing does provide some information that he does not really receive otherwise: the fact that her father, the King, wants her to stay out of politics, and that she is planning "something" to prove him wrong but what she is planning she will not say, and this tidbit proves irrelevant since it does not add any information to the Glossary).
Immediately after their little tryst, Triss barges in and tells Geralt that he must go speak with Leuvaarden again regarding a proposition. Apparently she does not notice what has just happened between the princess and the witcher. So it is back to the main banquet hall to speak with Leuvaarden who outlines the details of his plan triggering three new quests: Reaping Time, Following the Thread and Lock and Key (however you could've get the first quest before this point by speaking with Vaska).
Before speaking this last time with Declan, Geralt can have a "chat" with Erkyn von Blunt. He accepts only alcohol of at least "medium" strength. Five bottles later, Geralt is the proud owner of the useful House of the Night signet ring, and von Blunt's cover is blown. Oh well...
Phases.
The Banquet.
Triss is trying to convince me to go to Leuvaarden's reception. It's due to take place on the upper level of the New Narakort Inn. "I've been invited to a banquet at the New Narakort Inn."
The Meeting.
I ran into Triss at Leuvaarden's reception. I can't wiggle out of this now. Triss asked me to lighten up and mingle, meet some of the other guests. "I'll look around, maybe meet someone interesting."
Conversations.
Finally a moment to myself. Haven't they ever heard of chairs...? Maybe I should use this time to talk to the other guests...away from Triss's [] vigilant gaze. "It may be worth my while to talk to the other guests."
The Tastes of a Princess.
What could the Princess of Temeria, formerly a striga, possibly like? Maybe the burgomeister knows something... "I should talk to Velerad about Adda's tastes." (500 XP)
The Letter.
Thaler promised to help me, but I have to get him a letter from the next room. It's in a chest bearing the emblem of Temeria. "Thaler wants me to fetch a letter from the next room."
Catoblepas.
Thaler revealed that Adda likes catoblepas meat, but only the burgomeister knows how to prepare it. "I need to get Velerad to tell me how he prepares catoblepas meat."
Velerad.
The burgomeister seems a bit nervous. Maybe he needs to relax before he'll talk to me... A shot of vodka should do the trick. "Velerad could use a shot of vodka."
Velerad Talks.
Velerad said Thaler is furious about what is requested of his men. Maybe I should talk to him... "I should speak with Thaler."
Catoblepas.
Catoblepas? Cotaplafis? How do you pronounce that and where the hell do you get it...? I think I need a miracle. Or magic. Triss? "I need to find some catoblepas meat for Adda. I need a miracle... or magic. Triss?"
The Catoblepas Illusion.
Triss promised to conjure up some catoblepas meat. I'll have to return the favor somehow... "Triss needs time to conjure up a catoblepas steak."
Catoblepas - Rare.
Triss created an illusion of catoblepas meat for me. Creative magic is fascinating... I must get the dish to Princess Adda. "I must take the catoblepas steak to Princess Adda." (500 XP)
The Alcove.
Adda invited me into her alcove. Does she want to talk politics or does she have something else in mind...? "Adda invited me to visit her in her alcove."
The Host.
The reception's almost over, the guests are leaving. I can now talk to the host in private. "I can now talk to the host in private." (1000 XP)
[End of quest].
[Quest ends without final phase in the journal.] (3000 XP)

Beauty and the Beast is an optional quest in Chapter III, given to Geralt by Carmen during her brief relocation to the swamp landing.
Walkthrough.
In Chapter III, we find our favorite witcher once again wandering Vizima's local swamp forest. This time, Carmen (the madame from the Eager Thighs brothel) is found by the landing, looking distraught. Geralt asks what brings her to such an unlikely location; she explains that her man is afflicted with lycanthropy and she would dearly love to cure him.
She has heard (from "Fat Sophie", who does not appear in game (by name)) that the druids might have a cure, but crossing the swamp seems a risky undertaking at best. Ever the gentleman, Geralt offers to speak to the druids on her behalf and report back. Carmen gratefully accepts his offer and heads back to town, telling him he can find her at the brothel when he has news.
Geralt then proceeds to the druids' grove and locates their Hierophant. After a bit of small talk, the witcher asks the druid about possible cures for lycanthropy. The hierophant points out that, as a witcher, Geralt should already know what to do. Geralt responds that the amnesia does not exactly help with recalling old cures, so the druid relents and explains that he knows of three possibilities: a shirt with fool's parsley woven into it, an alchemical potion or true love. The shirt seems the easiest option, but the druid cautions that the identity of the werewolf must be known before any of the cures can be used.
The witcher then heads back to Vizima to speak with Carmen and find out who her man is, but she will not budge. She refuses to divulge the identity of the werewolf and Geralt is left to figure it out for himself. No amount of digging seems to reveal anything, until he has undertaken another quest (Lock and Key, for Declan Leuvaarden).
During a seemingly unrelated investigation into a possible Salamandra hideout in the restricted Trade Quarter, Geralt finally learns the identity of the lycanthrope: Vincent Meis, captain of the City Guard. As with most of his adventures to date, Geralt is once again called upon to make a difficult decision: to kill or spare the werewolf.
Kill the werewolf:
Geralt decides that a monster is a monster. Nothing can be done to help Vincent, so he kills him and the quest ends (fails). (1500 XP)
Spare the werewolf:
Geralt decides that Vincent is not a monster at heart, and spares him.
Armed with his new knowledge of the identity of the werewolf, the witcher returns to the brothel and tells Carmen that he knows. He also explains the options that the Hierophant mentioned as the possible cures for Vincent. Carmen is eager to try anything to help her man; the game railroads you into trying the shirt first.
The Shirt.
Look around the golem cemetery and the druid camp for the leaves. You can also buy some from the Elder Druid.
Geralt provides the leaves, but Carmen needs time to weave them into a shirt and have Vincent wear it overnight. They agree to meet later and discuss how things went.
The next day Geralt returns to get news of the attempt, but the news is bad. The shirt did not work. It did not seem to do anything at all. They then decide to try the second option, the potion, but that will require the skills of an experienced alchemist...
The Potion.
Remembering his old friend Kalkstein, Geralt decides to pay him a visit at the Mage's tower. (It is just a quick hop using the teleporter downstairs at the alchemist's old place in the Temple Quarter.) Once at the tower, the witcher asks the alchemist if he can make a lycanthropy potion. Luckily he can, and does, after a suitable period for the brewing and decoction. When the witcher returns for the potion, Kalkstein reveals that an essential ingredient is still missing: a virgin's tear. (An amusing little exchange takes place here.)
Geralt takes the teleporter back to the Temple Quarter, in search of a virgin's tear. He decides to try St. Lebioda's Hospital. Inside, he finds a nurse and makes his unusual proposition. She obliges. (See notes) He then continues on his way to the Eager Thighs to deliver the potion to Carmen. Once again, they agree that the witcher should return the next day for news of the results.
Once again, the news is bad and Vincent remains under the curse, leaving only one option: true love.
True Love.
Geralt and Carmen discuss her relationship with the captain. She feels Vincent is not truly in love with her. Geralt tries to reassure her and suggests that he speak with the captain, and heads out to find him for a chat. After a heart-to-heart, our hero convinces the captain that he does not have a future as a crime-fighting werewolf superhero.
Later, when speaking with Carmen she reveals that Vincent is no longer a werewolf. Eureka! This time the cure worked.
Phases.
The Cure.
I promised a hooker named Carmen that I'd talk to the druids and ask for a cure for her beloved, who's been cursed with lycanthropy. "I must see the druids and obtain their cure for lycanthropy."
Three Ways.
The hierophant described three different cures for lycanthropy: a shirt woven of fool's parsley leaves, a magic medicine only an alchemist can prepare, and true love. I should find Carmen, who must be back in the Temple Quarter. If she reveals the werewolf's human identity, I can determine if he remains a man at heart, or if he's all beast. "I should get Carmen to reveal the werewolf's identity. She went back to the Temple Quarter."
A Most Mysterious Werewolf.
Carmen refuses to reveal her beloved's identity. We won't get far that way. I'll wait and see what happens - maybe I can learn who the werewolf is myself. "I need to wait, see what happens - maybe I can learn the werewolf's identity on my own."
Vincent the Werewolf.
Spared the werewolf:
It's clear now. The werewolf and Carmen's beloved? It's Vincent! I should talk to Carmen. "I should talk to Carmen about Vincent."
Killed the werewolf:
I slew the werewolf... I had no choice. Vincent could not be cured of his lycanthropy. "Vincent is dead. His lycanthropy could not be cured". (1500 XP) and the quest fails.
Cooperation.
I told Carmen I know Vincent is the werewolf. She agreed to cooperate. We need to discuss the details. "Carmen and I need to discuss the details."
Fool's Parsley.
I promised Carmen five fool's parsley leaves. She'll use them to make a shirt for Vincent. The herbs grow in the swamps." I promised I'd bring Carmen five fool's parsley leaves."
To Carmen.
I have enough fool's parsley now. I can give the leaves to Carmen." I need to get the leaves to Carmen."
Other Methods.
I gave the fool's parsley to Carmen. I should check on her in a while to see if the shirt worked. "I should check on Carmen some time to see if the medicine worked."
Failure.
Carmen told me the shirt didn't work. We need to try other means. "I need to try all the known remedies for lycanthropy." (1500 XP)
Kalkstein's Medicine.
I asked Kalkstein to prepare the lycanthropy medicine. The alchemist promised to get right to work. I should tend to other matters and return for the potion later." The alchemist promised to make the medicine for Vincent. I should tend to other matters and see Kalkstein again later."
A Virgin's Tear.
Kalkstein gave me the lycanthropy medicine, but warned me that he wasn't sure if the potion would work. Now I need a virgin's tear. In Vizima? Sounds hard to come by." I need a virgin's tear. I should ask some townswomen".
A Potion for Carmen.
I obtained a virgin's tear. It turned out to be harder than I thought. Now I can deliver the potion to Carmen. "Now I can take the potion to Carmen."
The Remaining Methods.
I gave Carmen Kalkstein's medicine. I certainly hope it cures Vincent. I should check on Carmen in some time and ask. "I should visit Carmen in some time to see if the medicine worked."
Failure.
Carmen told me Kalkstein's medicine didn't work. The druid mentioned two remedies for lifting the curse - the potion and a shirt of fool's parsley. He also said something about true love, but he wasn't sure if it works. "I need to try all the know [] remedies for lycanthropy. I need to know for certain..." (1500 XP)
Desperate Means.
I've tried two methods for lifting the werewolf curse and both have failed... Folklore is all I have left. I don't believe the fairytales about the power of love, but I have nothing left. Perhaps love can save Vincent... "I must try the last method - true love."
Love.
As all other methods have failed, I'm trying to persuade Carmen to try what is possibly her last resort - love. She says it's no good, because that's not a feeling Vincent can have for her. I should talk to him. "Carmen claims Vincent doesn't love her. I should talk to the captain."
Talking to Vincent.
I told Vincent that true love can cure him of lycanthropy. He seemed moved. I should visit Carmen in some time and ask her if anything changed. "I should visit Carmen in some time and ask her if anything changed."
The Curse is Lifted.
It seems the lycanthropy curse is lifted. Was it true love? Only time can tell. "Vincent was freed from the lycanthropy curse." (3000 XP)

Blue Eyes is an optional quest in Chapter III in which a knight asks Geralt to find his missing sister, Blue Eyes.
Walkthrough.
As Geralt walks into The New Narakort one sunny day, he notices a knight of the Order, Patrick de Weyze, sitting at a table near the door and decides to get some news of Siegfried. After getting a quick update, the conversation turns to matters more important to the knight. His sister, the blue-eyed lass is missing. It seems that she was found unconscious with blood trickling from her neck one morning not too long ago. Since then she has disappeared entirely and her brother is concerned that she is in the thrall of a vampire.
The witcher agrees to take to job and begins keeping an eye out for any information on the whereabouts of the blue-eyed lass. Eventually he decides to have a look around the local brothel, going inside and, lo and behold, there is a beautiful young woman who matches de Weyze's description perfectly, but she is working there.
Our hero decides to chat her up, maybe check out her line of services. They begin to converse and things are going swimmingly so he decides to take things further and proposes a date (sleep with her). They negotiate and a deal is struck, provided the witcher has the courtesy of bathing first, not necessarily alone, mind you.
After the date, Geralt remarks about her neck wound, saying it adds character but this does not elicit any further information from Blue Eyes. One thing she does make clear is that she is happy where she is and has no desire to be elsewhere. So the witcher decides to go back and let Patrick know what he has found.
De Weyze is not amused by the assumption that his sister is a prostitute and blusters that she would never lower herself to such a degrading lifestyle, but the witcher points out that she does match the description in every detail, right down to the scar on her neck, so the knight must concede that it is indeed his sister who is turning tricks at the brothel. He does qualify this with the assertion that this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that a vampire within the brothel must be controlling her. What else could explain such uncharacteristic behaviour? He insists that Geralt go back and find the vampire. Geralt agrees to have another look.
The witcher heads back to the brothel, but he knows that there is nothing of interest on the first floor. Been there, done that, so the second floor must be where to look next. Getting there is not so easy, though. His path is immediately blocked by a large man who makes it quite clear that no vagabond in leather rags is swanning upstairs to see the "Queen of the Night" without a specific invitation and no such invitation is in evidence.
If Geralt has the House of the Night signet ring: he shows it to the bouncer and this is sufficient to make him back off, reluctantly and let the witcher pass,
If he does not have the ring: he can either bribe the Bodyguard with 250 , some fisstech or dispense with niceties and simply fight him.
Once upstairs, he meets the Queen of the Night, accompanied by several Sisters of the Night. She is a bit miffed that the witcher has just barged in and makes it clear that this is not the sort of behaviour she usually tolerates. She says that the witcher she knew would never act this way. Geralt is contrite and apologises citing his amnesia as a partial excuse and asks how he knows her. She points out that "she" knew "him", he never knew her. She knew him to be a close friend of her ex-lover, Regis (the vampire that Dandelion spoke of during Shani's party), who died fighting at the witcher's side.
The vampiress and the witcher continue their conversation and the topic naturally shifts to the blue-eyed lass downstairs. She explains that the girl is there of her own free will. Blue Eyes summoned the Queen herself and wants nothing more than to become a vampire and live forever, remaining young and beautiful. She absolutely does not want to marry some old codger and live a life of drudgery which is what awaits her if she returns to her brother.
So Geralt must make another hard decision: believe that the blue-eyed lass is there on her own will (and get to participate in a foursome with the vampires as they show their appreciation), or resist (and kill the vampires).
Side with the vampiresses:
If Geralt chooses the sexual encounter, Patrick de Weyze shows up, thankfully "after" the sex. He accuses the witcher of collusion with the vampires and demands they settle things then and there, menacing that this will be Geralt's demise. Not so says our hero and the swordplay begins, with a little help from a bruxa and some alps.
After our hero has dispatched the knight and his squires, he stops to speak with the blue-eyed lass. She is grateful for his help but a bit disgusted by the brutality she has just witnessed, and so ends the quest. (5000 XP, 200 ) (Warning: One of Patrick's squire's will attack the blue-eyed woman, who is standing on the stairs if he gets too close. Do not let her die.) or
Side with Patrick (and kill the vampiresses):
If Geralt chooses to kill the "Queen of the Night" and her courtesans, he does just that, though he may choose to do so either before or after having sex with the vampires.
Before sex:
He kills the "Queen of the Night" and the "Sisters of the Night" who join the fight. He then goes downstairs to speak to the blue-eyed lass. She can not believe what the witcher has done saying that the "Queen of the Night" had only ever spoken highly of him (ouch!). She then decides that some good could still come of the situation, at least for her, and begs Geralt kill her brother.
The witcher (naturally) asserts that he does not kill humans which infuriates her, prompting her to say that she hopes "his sword" drops off. Our hero then leaves and goes back to The New Narakort and informs Patrick de Weyze of his findings. De Weyze is also furious because "Blue Eyes" is not with the witcher and refuses to pay the agreed sum. (2000 XP)
After sex:
Patrick de Weyze drops in after Geralt had sex with the vampires and Geralt can choose to side with him to kill them after some verbal skirmishing. However, he is less than pleased that Geralt initially sided with the vampires but nevertheless rewards him for seeing the light. (2000 XP)
Remain neutral: If Geralt sleeps with the vampires and decides to not take sides when discovered by Patrick de Weyze, a free for all ensues. (3500 XP)
Notes.
You can pay for "companionship" with the blue-eyed lass at a reduced price if you show her the House of the Night signet ring. Or you can give her either a sapphire or gold sapphire ring as a gift. Or you can both show the ring and then give the gift; this will pay for everything.
Phases.
The Missing Sister.
I spoke with Patrick de Weyze, the knight at the New Narakort. He says a vampire bit his sister, and she then ran away from home to protect her family. I promised to notify him if I find the girl. Apparently she has incredible blue eyes. "I promised to find the blue-eyed girl who was bitten by a vampire. I should look around town."
A Brothel Full of Vampires.
Carmen admitted that the girls from the brothel in the Trade Quarter bear vampire bites. Maybe I should look there? "I should look for Blue Eyes at the city brothel."
Blue Eyes.
I saw a blue-eyed girl at the brothel. Could this be the knight's sister? "I should ask the knight if the girl from the brothel is his sister."
Proof and/or Fang Marks.
Geralt fails to notice fang marks immediately:
Patrick de Weyze refuses to believe the girl at the brothel is his sister. I must find some way to prove it to him. "I must prove that the girl from the brothel is the knight's sister. I should go back there."
Proof.
Geralt notices fang marks:
There are fang marks on the blue-eyed girl's neck. Too many coincidences. She must be the knight's sister. "I should tell the knight about the marks I saw on the girl's neck."
Control.
Patrick de Weyze suggested that his sister is in the brothel only because a vampire controls her. Control of that kind is only possible over short distances, so the vampire must be in the brothel. "I must find out if somebody from the brothel is controlling the girl's mind." (1500 XP)
A Life Spared or The Duel.
Side with the vampires:
I decided to let the vampires live. They truly try to coexist peacefully and not harm humans. "I decided to let the brothel vampires live."
A Life Spared.
Side with Patrick:
I refused the vampiress' bribe. This will be a tough fight. "I'm in for a tough fight with the vampires."
Another Point of View or Dead Vampires + Time to See the Knight + The Girl Escapes.
Stay with the vampires:
Blue Eyes was not thrilled to see her brother. Would she really rather not go home? Or does a vampiress control her? "I need to decide how to resolve this matter. I should speak with Patrick de Weyze."
Another Point of View.
Stay with Patrick:
The vampires lie dead. Blue Eyes needs to be taken away from here. I should speak to her or her brother. "I need to take Blue Eyes away. I should talk to her or her brother."
A strange story...it seems the vampiress was trying to help the blue-eyed girl after all. Everything will be as it used to be. "I must visit the knight and collect my reward."
Blue Eyes escaped and the knight refused to pay. I'm the sucker again. "Blue Eyes fled and the knight refused to pay." ("Quest ends:" 2000 XP)
Defying the Brother or Slaughter or Defying the Vampires.
Stick with the vampires:
I decided to defy Patrick de Weyze. Race - be it human, elven or vampire - is never reason enough to kill. "I've decided to defy Patrick de Weyze."
Defying the Brother.
Remained neutral:
There was a fight at the brothel. They all perished save the blue-eyed girl. I should talk to her. "The blue-eyed girl and I were the only ones to survive the melee. I should talk her."
Slaughter.
Switch to Patrick:
Ultimately, I decided to slay the vampires. "I decided the vampires would have to die."
Betrayal or Neutrality or A Knight's Death.
Sided with Patrick:
I slaughtered the vampires though I made a deal with them earlier. Is there any wrong in betraying a monster? "I slew the vampires in spite of the deal we made earlier."
Betrayal.
Remained neutral:
Hardly my most successful attempt at standing aside, remaining neutral... "The blue-eyed girl was not happy." ("Quest ends:" 500 + about 370 of loot + 3500 XP + about 2000 kill exp)
Neutrality.
Sided with the vampires:
I made a choice and bloodshed followed. The knight and his squires are dead. "The knight and his squires are dead."
The Knight and His Sister or A New Vampiress.
Sided with Patrick:
Blue Eyes hardly seems thrilled to be going home. And the knight stopped short of killing me only because I helped him fight the vampires. But that one night... was worth it all... "The knight and Blue Eyes hardly seem to like me." (about 200 of loot + 2000 XP + about 1750 kill exp)
The Knight and His Sister.
Sided with the vampires:
The Lady of the Night promised to grant the Gift to Blue Eyes, rendering her truly free. I helped create a female vampire. What kind of a witcher am I? "I helped create a female vampire. What kind of a witcher am I?" (200 + about 170 of loot + 5000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Dandelion's Lute is a secondary quest in Chapter III of "The Witcher". Dandelion has left his lute in the bedroom of a young "music student" of his and needs Geralt's help to retrieve it.
Walkthrough.
The first time the witcher enters The New Narakort, he spies the bard sitting at a table near the door. It seems Dandelion is there to give a concert, but his lute is missing. He will not go into further detail until a little liquid encouragement, in the form of seven beers, is supplied.
It seems that Dandelion is up to his old tricks and has been caught by Rozalind Pankiera'a father giving the girl lessons of a dubious nature. He was subsequently chased out of the house, leaving his precious lute behind and now he dare not return. He wants the witcher to retrieve the lute, and since they are friends, Geralt agrees (otherwise you would not be reading this walkthrough, right?).
Once at the Pankieras' house (which is just around the corner and then across the street from the New Naracort Inn, on the way to the Maribor Gate), our hero is confronted by the irate father who initially will not let the witcher enter. A conversation ensues leading to one of two choices:
Either way, the witcher finally makes it upstairs where he meets the young lady in question, Rozalind herself. It seems that her father has locked her in her room since the incident and Dandelion has not even been back to her window. Geralt explains that Dandelion is basically a bounder and that she should have expected no less, but he does sympathize and suggests that giving back the lute would make it seem like she dumped the bard and not the other way around.
She does see the logic in that argument but then gets a little carried away with the scenario she decides to construct. Deciding that she would go as far as saying that she had refused a marriage proposal from the bard. At this point, Geralt has an opportunity for a little action himself, actually a couple of opportunities.
He can either tell her that saying she refused a marriage proposal would be pushing the bounds of credibility, in which case she gets a bit upset, or he can agree and get right to the rumpy-pumpy. If he does initially upset her, all is not lost, he just has to commiserate a little and then offer to cheer her up. Either way it is one more notch in the bedpost and then back to the New Narakort to deliver the instrument to its owner.
Phases.
The Lute / Dandelion's Lute.
Geralt learns of the lute from the bard:
Dandelion asked me to recover his lute. Without it, he can't perform as scheduled at the New Narakort. Apparently, the lute is in a certain house in Vizima. "Dandelion needs his lute. He left it in a certain house in Vizima... "
Geralt just finds the lute:
I found Dandelion's lute at the home of a certain charming young woman. Seems her father was not happy about her relations with the poet... I must take the lute to Dandelion. I'm sure he misses it... "I must return the lute to Dandelion. He must miss it..."
Daddy Sees Red.
So that's the story... Dandelion screwed some lass and now her daddy reaches for his axe every time he sees a bard. I must be careful when I enter his house. "I need to be careful when I enter that house. Apparently, dad's up in arms."
The Muse.
It turns out the lute is in the possession of a certain merchant's beautiful daughter. It's somewhere in her room, she's keeping it as a memento of her lover. "I should look for the lute in the damsel's room."
The Lute Reclaimed.
I have Dandelion's lute. Time to return it to the owner so that he can perform at the New Narakort. "I need to get back to the New Narakort and give Dandelion his lute." (1500 XP)
The Concert.
I gave the lute to Dandelion. He's always getting into trouble and I'm always having to save him. He invited me to his concert - at eight at the New Narakort. To tell the truth, I'm in no mood to listen to his wailing. "Dandelion invited me to his concert - at the New Narakort at eight o'clock." (5000 XP)

Geralt receives Echoes of Yesterday from Yaevinn at the beginning of Chapter III, if the witcher happens to be in the Druids' grove in the swamp. The elf asks Geralt to locate his men who appear to have gone missing in the sewers of the Trade Quarter.
Walkthrough.
Find Yaevinn in the swamp and get the quest, then proceed to the Trade Quarter (Triss' house) using the teleporter in the Mage's tower. From there, head to the sewers.
After killing the ten or so drowners en route, you will find a dwarf named Ren Grouver and two elves standing around having a conversation about a skirmish. Talk to Ren. He will tell you about their most recent encounter with a monster in the elven ruins and ask you to get rid of it. The beast is not only blocking his path and but has killed some of his compatriots. He describes one of the unfortunate as having simply "exploded".
Take the mission and proceed into the ruins through the tunnel which can be seen through a large opening in the sewer wall. When you arrive at your final destination, you should see a cut scene featuring a succubus-like creature. Enter the room and kill it - it is a bruxa (vampire).
When you are done, Ren will enter the hall and thank you for your help. At this point Geralt mentions that the fight was "worth more than [Ren could possibly] know", which is strange as the actual battle is a breeze, but I digress. Next, Yaevinn arrives via the Elven Ruins teleporter, thanks you, tells you to forget what you have just seen here and gives you your reward. That is it, all done.
Phases.
The Elven Temple.
Yaevinn asked me to find his men. Apparently, they descended into the sewers to find an old elven temple. He also asked me to recover all the artefacts related to Lara I can find. "Yaevinn asked me to find his men in the sewers of Vizima."
Evil.
I met Yaevinn's men. Just as he said, they tried to get inside the temple, but found something living there, something evil and powerful. Only two elves and one dwarf survived. I should find out what happened to the others. "I should find out what killed Yaevinn's men."
The Vampire.
The temple was home to a vampire, one powerful enough to kill most of Yaevinn's men. It was a tough fight, but I slew him. ("editorial - oh really? and wasn't it a her?") The elf should reward me generously. "I slew the vampire who killed Yaevinn's men. The elf should reward me generously." (2000 XP)
Yaevinn.
Although I found no mementos, Grouver thanked me. It's all very strange... Why did the Scoia'tael need to get to the elven ruins? Grouver also said Yaevinn would pay me for completing the job. "We found no artefacts. Why did the Scoia'tael want to get to the elven ruins? I need to speak with Yaevinn."
Elven Ruins.
I sense Yaevinn hasn't told me something. Why did he want to get to the elven ruins so badly? There's nothing here... "I brought Yaevinn to the elven ruins." (300 + 4500 XP)

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Medic in Distress is an optional quest in Chapter III which Geralt can undertake when he comes upon a distressed nurse outside St. Lebioda's Hospital.
Walkthrough.
The Distressed nurse can be found standing next to the Hospital near the Gardener from Noon-1pm. Concerned, Geralt asks her what is wrong, but at first she says she just does not want to talk about it.
A little gentle persuasion and she spills the beans. Her granny has been behaving really strangely of late, barely speaking to her granddaughter. In fact she only seems interested in keeping her away from the cellar. The nurse is worried about what is going on and asks the witcher, who has come highly recommended by Shani, to have a look. Granny, she explains, lives just off Merchant Street.
The witcher then heads over to Granny's house, only to be rather unceremoniously turfed right back out. It seems that daytime is no time to visit Granny. He decides to come back later, at night.
That night, Geralt goes back to Granny's house and begins to look around. No need to worry about waking Granny, she is apparently passed out from a little too much wine (judging from the amount of wine she keeps in the house), so he decides to go downstairs and see what all the hoopla is about. There he finds a fleder. Being a witcher, our hero does what a witcher does and dispatches the beast without a second thought. He then goes back upstairs.
It seems that the ruckus has roused Granny. She sees what has happened and berates the witcher for having killed "her son". Geralt points out that it was "not" her son, but a fleder. She must have been in his thrall. She will have none of this explanation and throws him out once more. At least the fleder is gone.
The next day, the witcher reports to the nurse (noon to 1pm) who confirms that his actions were indeed correct. Granny is back to her old self. She thanks Geralt and gives him the 50 they agreed.
Phases.
Grandma.
The nurse asked me to see what's going on with her grandmother. I sense that the old lady has some problems with her cellar... "I have to see what's in the grandma's cellar."
The Location.
The old lady lives in a merchants' alley, right next to the crossing. I have to climb down to the cellar of her house and find the source of trouble. "The old lady lives in a merchants' alley, right next to the junction."
Thrown Out.
Grandma's thrown me out. I think it will be safer to pay her a visit at night, when she's asleep. "It will be safer to pay 
Grandma a visit at night." (This phase will only occur if you attempt to enter during the daytime.)
Monster Killed.
The monster I killed was probably influencing the old lady mentally and bending her to his will. She should recover now. "I have to go and see the nurse to claim my reward." (500 XP)
The quest is completed.
I was able to help the old woman and her granddaughter. (50 + 2000 XP)

Depending on your point of view, either Vaska or the Hierophant gives Geralt the Diplomacy and Hunting quest in Chapter III. They both contribute information to get things started in this quest which reveals even more about the Salamandra organization and the extent of its reach.
Walkthrough.
Vaska gives Geralt this quest upon the completion of Reaping time, when the witcher finishes that quest and returns to her with the report. After thanking him for all his help (as he has also found the missing boy by then) she tells him that the Druids have been keeping an eye on Salamandra and could help him with his plan to dismantle the organization. She tells him to seek out the Hierophant for more details.
Geralt then goes to the Druids' grove and speaks with the Hierophant who tells him that he has "heard it on the wind and seen [what the witcher wants] through animal eyes."He explains that Salamandra wants to increase the potency of fisstech and have asked the druids for help with ingredients. He also offers to help kill Roland Bleinheim by luring him with talk of this more potent ingredient for the drug-lab. For this, He wants a psilocybe mushroom, which he tells Geralt is in the swamp cave to the south, guarded by cockatrices.
The witcher then heads over to the cave to find and pick the aforementioned mushroom. It is entirely possible at this point in the narrative that Geralt has already cleared the cave of the cockatrices as that is where he found one of the three groups of hostages in Reaping Time and the missing boy.
Having secured the mushroom, our hero then returns to the grove with it. The Hierophant is grateful for the help, but this is just the beginning. He gives Geralt time to get ready for the ambush, if he needs it. When the witcher is ready, they head out, but not alone; the Hierophant also brings his wyvern friends as backup. He also provides the witcher with heal services during the battle (unless he is knocked down himself, but do not worry, he will get back up after the fight.)
After the battle, Geralt loots the remains (of course!) and finds an Encrypted document as well as a Royal letter of safe conduct on Roland Bleinheim's dead body. The document can not be read as is, it needs to be decoded, so Geralt has to wait until he has completed the The Viziman Connection quest and found the key to the Salamandra code to further the investigation. He thanks the Hierophant and they have one last little chat which concludes the quest.
Phases.
The Hierophant / Bleinheim's Death.
Geralt learns of the druids' fight:
I learned the Druids are willing to help me combat Salamandra. "I should speak to the Hierophant in the Druids' grove."
Geralt stumbles on the Salamandra camp:
I killed Roland Bleinheim, the local Salamandra leader. I should search his corpse, I may find something important. "I killed Roland Bleinheim. I should check his pockets."
Picking Mushrooms / The Coded Message.
Geralt learns of the druids' fight:
The Hierophant told me Salamandra has been harassing the druids, trying to force them to cooperate. We need to get the Salamandra leader out of their camp, set up an ambush. To do this I must find a psilocybe mushroom and bring it to the chief druid. The mushroom grows in cave [] - a cockatrice-infested one, unfortunately. "I must retrieve a psilocybe mushroom from the cave indicated by the druid."
Geralt stumbles on the Salamandra camp:
Roland had a coded message on him. Now I need a key to decode it... "I've captured some Salamandra documents. I can now pursue some other leads."
Shrooming.
I found a psilocybe mushroom. I should take it to the Hierophant so that he can prepare the potion that will help us set a trap for Roland Bleinheim. "I should take the psilocybe to the Hierophant."
The Trap.
I found the mushroom and gave it to the Hierophant. He said the trap for Roland Bleinheim is set. I should prepare for the fight and talk to the druid when I'm ready. "I should prepare for the fight and talk to the Hierophant when I'm ready" (1000 XP)
The Escort.
Ready at last. I shouldn't leave the druid behind on our way to the meeting. "I should escort the druid on our way to the meeting."
Preparations.
I should get ready, the Salamanders will arrive soon. "There'll be a fight, that's certain. I should prepare... "
Bleinheim's Death.
I killed Roland Bleinheim. "I should search Bleinheim's corpse."
The Coded Message.
Roland had a coded message on him. Now I need a key to decode it. In the meantime, I need to get the document I found to Leuvaarden. "I have what I came for. Time to bid the Hierophant farewell."
The Letter.
I solved the Salamandra problem in the swamp and found an encrypted letter in the process. I need to know what it says. Leuvaarden is my best bet. "I can now pursue the other leads in the investigation." (4000 XP)

Reaping Time is a quest given to Geralt by Vaska in Chapter III when the witcher goes back to the village, having previously helped rid them of drowners.
Walkthrough.
While on one of his many trudges through the fens and marshes of the swamp forest, Geralt decides to go back and visit the brickmakers. Perhaps Vaska knows something more about the Salamanders, who knows?
But it seems that all is not well in the sleepy hamlet. Roland Bleinheim and his band have kidnapped a number of the brickmakers and are forcing them to gather beggartick for the fisstech operation. The eldress knows of the whereabouts of one group of slave workers: near the collapsed tower in the north of the swamp. She is so outraged by the actions of the Salamandra towards her people that she asks the witcher to kill Bleinheim quite explicitly.
Geralt immediately heads out to find the hapless villagers. He locates the first band by the collapsed tower, just as Vaska had said, where three Salamandra are guarding the brickmakers. Near that spot, he spots many Salamandra and their apparent boss, Roland Bleinheim, setting their base of operations, as part of another quests, which can be done right now as well, but he can be dealt with later "the right way". Back to business, Geralt carefully circles the area, choosing his optimal location from which to launch his attack. And what an attack it is! In no time at all, the workers are free and their guards' bodies litter the ground. The grateful rescuees tell the witcher that the two other groups of workers are being held in the cave and the Lumberjacks' glade.
Our hero continues and two similar scenes follow, but in the cave with the penultimate group of workers, there is a surprise. A small boy, the missing boy Geralt has been looking for since Chapter II, is among them. He speaks to the boy, who rambles on about the Water Lords and whatnot, and determines that the child seems in good health, physically anyway, and sends him on his way.
Having freed everyone, the witcher heads back to the village and Vaska. After he does, Vaska rewards him with a book and the "Blessing of the Water Lords", for which Geralt is eternally grateful (wink). She also tells him that the druids have been keeping an eye on Salamandra and might prove useful to his investigation. He thanks her and heads off in the direction of the Druids' grove.
Phases.
Investigation in the Swamp.

The Brickmakers.
Vaska, the eldress of the brickmakers, asked me to free her people who have been captured by the Salamanders led by Roland Bleinheim. The bandits are forcing the prisoners to harvest herbs.

"I need to free the brickmakers working in three places: the cave, the glade and near the collapsed tower."

Siegfried gives Geralt this quest at the beginning of Chapter III. People have been disappearing in the cemetery and the Order would like to get to the bottom of it. They do not have the manpower to spare, so a witcher's help is required.
Walkthrough.
At the very beginning of Chapter III, Geralt finds Siegfried at his new post outside the Cloister, just up the hill from his old post. They chat and while catching up, Siegfried mentions that he could use the witcher's services to investigate the mysterious disappearances of townsfolk in the cemetery. Being the obliging soul that he is, the witcher agrees and heads over to the necropolis.
Once inside, he finds evidence of ghoul activity, but then finds more nefarious traces - the corpse of a woman has obviously been stabbed and not eaten. A few random encounters with some ghouls later and our hero comes upon a particularly unusual sight: a "talking" ghoul named Vetala. They chat and then our hero must then decide whether or not to allow the ghoul to live.
Kill Vetala: Geralt believes that Vetala was behind the murders. He kills the ghoul, but not without a fight, and it seems that Vetala has some allies as several other necrophages join in. Once the gang of ghouls has been dispatched, the witcher reports back to Siegfried for his full reward and the quest ends. (2000 XP when Vetala dies, 2500 XP and 200 when reporting to Siegfried).
Spare Vetala: In exchange for his life, Vetala tells Geralt who is really responsible for the disappearances: the Scoia'tael. There is a unit of elves and dwarves over by the cemetery crypt. The witcher goes to intercept them just as they are about to leave. They offer him a choice: stand and fight leaving the people they kidnapped to die in the crypt, or allow the Scoia'tael to leave and save the innocents inside.
Innocents: If Geralt decides to save the innocent people, he must enter the crypt immediately. Inside he will be attacked by ghouls mostly as he heads for the farthest chamber where the hostages are cowering. They are surrounded by about five more ghouls. Once the necrophages have been dispatched, one of the women thanks the witcher for his assistance. The witcher then reports back to Siegfried, who is more pleased with him, explaining that the nobler option was taken and rewards the witcher more generously for his service. (2000 XP when the last undead dies, 4500 XP and 400 when reporting to Siegfried)
Murderers: Geralt attacks the murderers. (2000 XP when killing any of the Scoia'tael, 3500 XP and 300 when reporting to Siegfried)
This concludes the quest.
Phases.
The Cemetery.
People are disappearing at the cemetery. Siegfried asked me to investigate. I should have a look around. "Siegfried asked me to investigate the strange disappearances in Vizima's Cemetery."
Spare Vetala: I let the ghoul Vetala go. In exchange, he told me that an elven unit is killing people in the cemetery. I should find and annihilate them. "I should find and destroy the elven unit."
Kill Vetala: Whether talking or not, a ghoul is dangerous. I need to get rid of it before it claims more victims. "I need to slay the ghoul before it claims more victims."
Spare Vetala: I found the murderers, but they have given me a terrible choice. I can fight them or try to rescue the people they left at the mercy of the ghouls in the crypt. I doubt I can do both... "I can either fight the elves or rescue the people from the ghouls."
 Kill Vetala: I killed the monster named Vetala. It was probably responsible for the disappearances at the cemetery. I should tell Siegfried what I saw. "I should tell Siegfried what I saw here."
The talking ghoul is dead. Job done. "The cemetery should be safe now." (Quest ends: 200 + 2500 XP)
Fight the elves: I decided to eliminate the elves. The people in the crypt - I probably can't save them, but there will be no more murders. "I need to report to Siegfried." (2000 XP)
Save the innocents: I found the people in the crypt. I should speak to Siegfried. "I saved those trapped in the crypt. I should speak to Siegfried." (2000 XP)
Killed the elves: I found out why people were disappearing, but Siegfried was unhappy with my decision. He doesn't understand that killing the murderers instead of rescuing a few people will save more lives in the end. "I figured out the disappearances, but Siegfried was unhappy with my choice." (100 + 3500 XP)
Saved the innocents: I figured out the disappearances, and Siegfried was happy with my choice. He said human lives are most important, and his troops will hunt down the murderers. He was so happy he upped my reward. "I figured out the disappearances and Siegfried was happy with my choice." (400 + 4500 XP)

Walkthrough.
It seems that Jethro the jailer wants three vials of archespore juice. What for, who could say? Luckily, there are plenty in the swamp in Chapter III. After getting the required amount, Geralt strolls over to the jail, hands in the vials and collects his 200 from Jethro for a contract duly fulfilled.
Phases.
Archespore Juice.
The jailer Jethro posted a notice stating that he'll pay anyone who brings him three flasks of archespore juice. "I should collect three flasks of archespore juice for the jailer."
Loot.
I have the juice of three archespores. I should see Jethro and collect my reward. "I should see Jethro about my reward."
Payment.

Walkthrough.
Apparently the scribe at the town hall in the Trade Quarter needs five cockatrice feathers to make superior quills. This should be easy money for a witcher.
Geralt decides to head off to the swamp where he has heard there is a cave full of cockatrices. Once there he finds more than enough to fill the contract. He then heads back to town to collect the advertised reward.
Phases.
Cockatrice Feathers.
A scribe from town hall needs five cockatrice feathers. They're apparently far more durable than ordinary goose quills. "I need to collect five cockatrice feathers for the scribe."
Loot.

This is one of the most straightforward quests. The Innkeeper at The New Narakort in the Trade Quarter wants three wyvern steaks, and the only place to get wyvern steaks is from freshly killed wyverns. A quick trip to the swamp and a bit of swordplay (or sign casting) is all that is required.

&lt;/infobox&gt;The Source is a quest which is given to Geralt by Triss Merigold at the beginning of Chapter III. She asks him to place three sensors at each of three locations in the Temple and Trade Quarters to locate the source of some strange magical anomalies.
Walkthrough.
At the beginning of Chapter III, Triss gives Geralt three magic sensors and asks him to place them in some reliefs located around town. They will be used to triangulate the source of some strange magical anomalies she has recently noticed. Being the obliging soul that he is, he agrees to help her and heads out to find the reliefs in the Temple Quarter, cemetery, and Trade Quarter and place the spheres in each one.
The witcher then must find Triss to let her know that the task has been accomplished. Actually, he does not really have to say much as she already knows. She tells him about a child being kept at St. Lebioda's Hospital. That child, Alvin is a source and hence the origin of the magical anomalies. Triss wants Geralt to retrieve the child and bring him to her where he can be properly supervised and trained to control his wild magical abilities, but Shani is unwilling to release him. Triss points out that Shani is Geralt's friend and that he should be the one to make her see sense.
So it is off to the hospital, but just as he enters the Temple Quarter, Shani "greets" him with a few choice comments about Triss and asks him to leave the child with her instead. (She even goes so far as to say that she does not want the sorceress to get her "dirty paws" on Alvin) Geralt then continues en route to St. Lebioda's, but instead of Alvin he finds Dandelion, who tells him he has just witnessed Alvin being dragged away, kicking and screaming by some Salamandra types. He boasts that he followed them and found out where they have taken the boy, and that he can show the witcher the exact location. He then runs off to do just that, forcing the witcher to follow.
They leave the hospital and head for Little Mahakam, to a previously locked door across the street and just west of the dwarven blacksmith shop. There Dandelion pauses and asserts that he wants to actually help this time - he is devising a whole new genre: the pro-active ballad. Geralt points out that this would not be the wisest move, so the bard reluctantly agrees to "sacrifice" himself and stay outside while the professional deals with the bad guys. Geralt then enters the building, mercifully unaided by the bard.
Inside, there are a few assassins guarding the child. He kills them with his usual speed and finds Alvin. Dandelion then enters and Geralt tells him to take the child to either Triss or Shani which Dandelion does. Just then, a few more assassins enter only to be dispatched with equal speed. The witcher then exits the building and heads off to visit Shani, or Triss depending on his choice of guardian for Alvin:
Shani
Having chosen Shani, Geralt goes to her house to have a chat and make sure Alvin is all right. She asks him to confront Triss and tell the sorceress that he decided to leave the child with her. As he tries to leave, Dandelion shows up and drags him to a drink-fest with Zoltan Chivay in the back room at the Hairy Bear Inn. The beer fest includes a discussion delving into the witcher's motivations. In the end, Dandelion suggests going to the House of the Queen of the Night and Geralt must once again make a choice, but luckily not one of any real consequence. The witcher is then dumped on Shani's doorstep, drunk. He can sleep things off at her place after an amusing little exchange.
Triss
Having chosen Triss, Geralt goes to her house, during the daytime, to speak with her. She, like Shani, asks him to go to the other woman and inform her that Alvin will be safer with someone who knows about magic. The witcher replies that he would rather face a swarm of Ghouls but agrees to the plan in the end. As he goes to leave, Dandelion shows up, and drags him off to The New Narakort for exactly the same drink-fest described in the Shani branch (substituting Triss for Shani whenever logical in the conversation) and it ends with our hero unceremoniously dumped on Triss' doorstep, drunk. His exchange with her about his state is less funny than the one with Shani. It appears that the sorceress is far more concerned with what the neighbours will think.
Making it official.
Shani
Geralt then heads off to tell Triss the "good news", which does not go over very well at all. Thereafter he will forever be greeted by the sorceress with "Speak, then get out of my sight!"
Triss
Geralt then heads off to tell Shani that Alvin is staying with Triss. She is "not" very happy, to put it mildly. Any further attempts at dialogue with her will result in her telling the witcher that he is no longer welcome at her place and that she plans to wipe his name from her memory.
He then heads back to whichever house Alvin is actually staying at. Now about Alvin...
Shani
Shani mentions that a silver amber ring would work nicely as proof of Geralt's affections, but she could not accept such a ring until "after" he has "bonded" with Alvin. For this, he might need some candy, or he may have to promise the boy a dog, show him to swordfight, or tell him he can do as he pleases when he is older. Basically indulge him, whatever the request.
Triss
Triss wants a ring which she would consider a pledge. Formerly known is the silver ruby ring (or possibly any ring with a ruby); as of EE are confirmed silver ruby signet ring and Gold ruby signet ring. Like Shani, she will not accept it right away and will want the witcher to show his fatherly competences, which for her means showing Alvin some discipline - oh well, nobody is perfect. This is easy, deny him at least one of his probably wishes.
Having satisfied his new-found "fatherly" duties, he is ready for some "quality" time:
Shani
Once Alvin's happy, Geralt returns to Shani, gives her the ring and gets his second roll in the hay with her.
Triss
Once Alvin has been "disciplined", Geralt returns to Triss for his second official (but third overall) encounter with her - she did check him for internal injuries when he woke up after the boss battle in the swamp.
The quest's ending finalises Geralt's romantic choice and his guardianship of Alvin.
Phases.
Magic Anomalies.
Triss Merigold is examining some magic anomalies. She said something about me helping her. I should ask her what she meant. "I should offer to help Triss."
Sensors.
Triss Merigold asked me to set three magic sensors in three places in Vizima: in the Trade Quarter near Town Hall, in the Temple Quarter by the entrance to the sewers and at the cemetery. Triss claims the anomalies are causing more monsters to appear in Vizima. The sensors should help us discover the source of these anomalies. "I have to place the three magic sensors: one near Town Hall, another near the sewer entrance and the third at the cemetery."
The First Sensor.
Triss asked me to place sensors in the Trade and Temple Quarters and in Vizima's cemetery. They should help us locate the source of the magic anomalies. I've placed the first sensor, two more to go. "I've placed the first sensor, two to go."
The Second Sensor.
Triss asked me to place sensors in the Trade and Temple Quarters and in Vizima's cemetery. They should help us locate the source of the magic anomalies. I've placed the second sensor, one more to go. "I've placed the second sensor, one to go."
Sensors in Place.
I set the sensors as Triss requested. They'll help us locate the source of the magic anomalies. "I set the sensors. I should talk to Triss."
Source Child.
I have learned a child is the source of the anomalies. Apparently, Elder Blood might course through the child's veins. Triss asked me to take the child from the hospital, but Shani doesn't want to let him go. I don't think Shani trusts Triss. "I'll take the source-child from the hospital and take him to Triss."
Shani.
When I left Triss's [], I ran into Shani. She claims Triss has dubious intentions towards the child. She asked me to bring the child to her. The boy is at St. Lebioda's Hospital. "Shani wants me to take the child from the hospital and bring him to her."
Alvin Kidnapped.
Alvin has been kidnapped. I should follow Dandelion, he'll show me the kidnappers' hideout. "I must follow Dandelion. He'll point out the hideout of Alvin's kidnappers."
Alvin Found.
I found Alvin. It turned out he was kidnapped by Salamanders. "I found Alvin. He was kidnapped by Salamanders." (1000 XP)
Shani was happy to hear I found the boy. She asked me to tell Triss that Alvin will be staying with her. "I'm to tell Triss that Alvin is staying with Shani." (4000 XP)
Triss was happy to hear I found the boy. She asked me to explain to Shani that she was going to keep him at her place. "I should tell Shani that Alvin's staying with Triss. Shani should be home." (4000 XP)
Woman and Child.
It looked like such an ordinary story at first. Who would have thought it would culminate with a woman in love and a child... "Who'd have thought it would end with a woman in love and a child. We'll see how things go..."

The Predatory Wyvern is one of nine optional trophy quests. This quest is obtained by killing an old female wyvern, Moa, which the Royal huntsman mentions is terrorizing the swamp. Only one trophy quest, The Beast of the Sewers, is not optional, making a total of ten.
Walkthrough.
While you are fulfilling the The Wyvern Contract, and most likely wading through the swamp near Wyvern Island, you will encounter a royal wyvern that is larger than the others and it has its own name, Moa. Kill it, and take the trophy (the head) from its dead body. Take your trophy to the Royal huntsman in the Trade Quarter for a nice reward.
Phases.
The Wyvern.
I slew the wyvern that was terrorizing the swamp. I need to take proof of having killed her to the Royal Huntsman in the Trade Quarter. "I should deliver proof of having killed the wyvern to the Royal Huntsman in the Trade Quarter."
A Reward.
I turned in the trophy and claimed my reward. "I received my reward for the trophy." (600 + 5000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;
The Ring is an optional quest in Chapter III which Geralt can undertake when he meets a desperate merchant on the dike who is trying to retrieve a family heirloom from the corpse of his uncle in the swamp forest.
Walkthrough.
There is a "desperate merchant" on the Vizima dike after Chapter II has been completed. Talk to him and he will ask you to retrieve a family ring. You can find the ring on a dead body in the swamp, directly behind the Shrine of Melitele (to the northwest) on a tiny bloedzuiger-infested island. Return with the family ring, and you get your reward.
Additionally, if you have already been to the swamp, you may well have the ring in your possession already, in which case you are done then and there.
Phases.
The Ring.
I promised to retrieve an ancestral ring belonging to the merchant I met at the dike. The ring was on his uncle's finger while said uncle was devoured by swamp monsters. I have to rent a boat from the ferryman and head for the swamps. "I must go to the swamps and find the ring."
Additional Information.
The uncle's body, and thus in all probability the ring as well, should lie next to Melitele's chapel in the swamps. "I will find the missing ring in the swamp, near the shrine of Melitele."
Lost Property.
I found the ancestral ring belonging to the merchant from the Dike. I should return it to him. I will meet him on the Dike. "I should give the ring to my employer on the Dike." (500 XP)
Reward.
I gave the ancestral ring to its owner and cashed in a 100 orens. "I received my payment." (100 + 2000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;
White Fang is one of nine optional trophy quests. It is obtained by killing a large wolf, Voref, which the Royal huntsman mentions is roaming the swamp forest. Only one trophy quest, The Beast of the Sewers, is not optional, making a total of ten. (Note that if you have this and Predatory Wvyern active, you can only take ONE trophy at a time, so make sure not to kill both bosses unless you can remember where you kill the second one, as once dead, these bosses do NOT respawn)
Walkthrough.
You will find the wolf roaming the swamp. It only spawns after dusk and before dawn, and will not appear when you are doing the quest to save the brickmakers. Kill it and take the trophy off from its dead body. Take the trophy to the Royal huntsman in the Trade Quarter for a nice reward.
Phases.
The Wolf.
I killed the great wolf. He shall hunt people no more. I should deliver the proof to the Royal Huntsman and claim my reward. "I need to give the trophy to the Royal Huntsman and claim my reward."
A Reward.
I turned in the trophy and claimed my reward. "I received my reward for the trophy." (600 + 5000 XP)

The ferryman can be found on the dike and on the landing in the swamp. He carries paying customers back and forth between these two locations for 5 orens a trip.
Note: He is not available from the Dike at night.
I also do not know if it is just my twisted mind but there seem to be a lot of allusions to bisexuality in this little exchange! When Geralt first asks Kalkstein about getting to the swamp, he asks "Does the ferry go both ways?". Then later at the dike, who — having played the game — can forget this exchange?
Ferryman: "Transport services at the best prices."Geralt: "Take me to the other side."Ferryman: "Made up your mind?"The appears, Geralt pays his 5 .Ferryman: "Ready?"Geralt: "How many times are you going to ask me that? Mhm. To the swamp."
Since the ferryman is involved in buying beggartick, and we know from both Vaska and the Hierophant that beggartick is used in the production of fisstech, it is possible that our chief means of transportation to and from the swamp is slightly less than legitimate in his other dealings. I wonder, does that make Geralt an accessory to the drug trade in addition to facilitating Jethro's drug habit?

Patrick de Weyze, brother of the "blue-eyed lass", was a knight of the Order of the Flaming Rose.
Biography.
Throughout 1270, Patrick spent most of his free time at The New Narakort in the Trade Quarter.
At one point, his sister was found unconscious in her bed with blood trickling from her neck. Shortly afterward she disappeared so the knight naturally thought she has transformed and been drawn somewhere. De Weyze wanted Geralt to find his sister and bring her back home. Secretly, he had already chosen her a husband but since she ended up in House of the Queen of the Night he had a hard time going on with the plan.
Later life.
Considered by many brethren to be the most skilled member of the Order, Patrick continued to be a loyal member well into 1275. However, by the said year he contracted a scrofula so fierce that he couldn't mount a horse even for a minute and thus wasn't able to take part in the annual International Knights' Tourney near Beauclair. To ensure their knightly Order would be still be represented Evariste of Metinna and others decided to sent Tailles.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Following the Thread is a quest given to Geralt by Jethro in the Dungeon. Talking to Leuvaarden is not necessary for this quest, but it will provide more background information.
Walkthrough.
After the reception, Leuvaarden explains to Geralt that he and his secret society need the services of a witcher to pin down exactly where Salamandra is operating in Vizima and what they are up to. They have determined that there are two cells: one in the Temple Quarter slums and another in the nearby Swamp. Maybe one or both of them contain some information or documents of interest. The merchant then advises the witcher to speak with Jethro for more information on the situation in the slums.
Grudgingly, Geralt goes to the Dungeon and has a chat with Jethro who, in turn, tells him a little bit about a local dealer: Angus. He suggests that the corner near the Hairy Bear Inn would be a good place to find the dealer. Geralt should pay him a visit and see what information he can get from him regarding the source of the drug in the quarter.
The witcher locates Angus (at NOON, so during the day and NOT at night) without any problem, exactly where he was expected to be. He approaches the lowlife and asks about fisstech. Angus is immediately suspicious and asks who fingered him as a dealer.
Geralt bluffs and says:
It was Jethro (or Ramsmeat, or Thaler):
Angus tells the witcher that he is in way over his head, then says "Eat me!" and runs off. Geralt follows him to his house, enters and is forced to kill him when Angus refuses to calm down and starts brandishing a knife. He then takes the gold signet ring and the letter of recommendation from the dealer's dead body.
It was Kalkstein:
Angus then mumbles something about what a blabbermouth Kalkstein is (hmmm... so the alchemist has bought fisstech, has he? I wonder what for?), but then he tells the witcher that for a mere 1500 , he will "give" him the letter of recommendation which will permit entry to the fisstech lab in the sewers. Geralt gives him the 1500 , gets the directions to the fisstech lab and heads off on his merry way.
He then goes to one of his favorite recent hangouts, the sewer system of the Temple Quarter. Once inside, he proceeds to the Salamandra hideout. There, he finds two oafish bandits guarding an iron gate.
Geralt uses the letter:
The guards let him inside where he is greeted by a Salamander who seems none the wiser as to the witcher's identity.
Geralt uses the correct password:
Geralt tells the guards that Angus sent him for some quality fisstech. They ask for the password which the witcher supplies. The guards let him inside where he is greeted by a Salamander who seems none the wiser as to the witcher's identity.
Geralt guesses the correct password:
Geralt tells the guards that Angus sent him for some quality fisstech. They ask for the password. The witcher bluffs but gets it right. The guards let him inside where he is greeted by a Salamander who seems none the wiser as to the witcher's identity.
Geralt don't need no stinkin' password:
Geralt decides to dispense with all this password nonsense and provokes the guards. The outcome is assured. He enters the lab where he is greeted by a Salamander who knows exactly who the witcher is. Our hero must then fight his way through the "thirty" Salamandra lurking inside.
He proceeds to look around and collect useful items as he goes. These Salamanders just leave gold lying everywhere! Having exhausted the possibilities in the other chambers, Geralt finds a room full of chemists busily making fisstech.
Thank the gods he used the password (successfully!):
He finds the Chief Chemist in that same room and wakes him. The chemist is certain that the witcher will tell his superiors that he was shirking his duties, but Geralt assures him that he will not say anything. In exchange, the chemist gives him the formula for the Petri's Philter potion.
At least all the Salamanders are dead:
He checks the room and finds few interesting items.
The witcher then continues to the deepest chamber of the crypt, intent on finding something to bring back to Leuvaarden. He notices a large chest at one end of the chamber and moves toward it:
Should have killed those guards!:
Our hero must then fight his way through the remainder of the thirty Salamandra lurking inside the crypt. Of course, he does manage it - somehow. The fact that he is an expert in Group style combat and carrying a well-oiled sword does not hurt.
At least most of the Salamanders are already dead:
Our hero must then dispatch the few Salamandra which remain lurking inside the crypt. Of course, he does so with ease.
Reaching the chest, Geralt opens it. Amongst the items inside, he finds a key and a letter (and, if he did not find the Chief Chemist, the Petri's Philter potion recipe is there as well). He then makes his way toward the exit, meeting the City Guards who have entered and are taking care of any stragglers. Once outside he meets Jethro who is waiting for him.
The jailer is his usual grateful self, which is to say, not! He cavalierly demands that Geralt finish things and get the drug lord, Gellert Bleinheim. But this time Geralt has had enough and calmly suggests that Jethro stop with the ordering. He also states that a fisstech junkie will not likely do a very good job of tracking down Bleinheim and agrees (grudgingly) to do so.
Gallery.
 
Phases.
Investigation in the Temple Quarter.
Leuvaarden asked me to pursue an investigation in the Temple Quarter. If I have any problems, I should see him to gain more information. Leuvaarden suggested I speak with Jethro, a fisstech addict who must have a source. Salamandra is involved in the fisstech trade. "I'm supposed to pursue an investigation in the Temple Quarter. I should speak with Jethro."
The Dealer.
Jethro wants me to learn who is dealing drugs in Vizima. They say there's a man who uses fisstech as an ingredient in other substances, and he gets it from a dealer named Angus. I'm supposed to visit him in the slums and question him about his suppliers. "I'm supposed to visit the slums and question Angus about his suppliers."
Angus's Place.
The innkeeper told me where Angus lives. I should pay him a visit, squeeze him for information about his fisstech suppliers. "The innkeeper told me where Angus lives. I should pay him a visit."
The Supplier.
I have a letter recommending me to the drug suppliers. It seems I can find them in the sewers. There's a strange word at the end of the letter, something like "th...n". "I'm likely to find the suppliers in the sewers. That's where I should go." (1000 XP)
Gellert Bleinheim.
I found a letter from Gellert Bleinheim, who commands one of Salamandra's cells. I should talk to Jethro. It's high time he did some work. "I should talk to Jethro." (500 XP)
The Destroyed Warehouse.
The city guards are lazy beyond belief. They arrive when things are over and done with. The laboratory, which doubled as a fisstech warehouse for Salamandra, is destroyed. I need to hunt down the boss of this cell now. "Now I have to hunt down the boss of this Salamandra cell." (100 + 3000 XP)

Lock and Key is a quest which is given to Geralt by Declan Leuvaarden after the banquet at the beginning of Chapter III. It furthers the witcher's investigation of Salamandra.
Walkthrough.
After the banquet and the resulting tête-à-tête with Princess Adda, Triss comes over to Geralt and tells him that their host, Declan Leuvaarden has a proposition for the witcher. He, and his nebulous network of intrigue, also want Salamandra gone. They have determined that Salamandra has cells in the Temple Quarter and the Swamp and they would like the witcher to investigate both areas and try to find some hard evidence proving criminal activity.
This spawns several new quests which must then be completed before proceeding with this main quest: Following the Thread followed by The Viziman Connection and Reaping Time followed by Diplomacy and Hunting. So Geralt sets out to complete those quests. Once he is done, he returns to The New Narakort to fill Declan in on what he found. Namely, an encrypted document and the key which decrypts it.
The merchant then sends the witcher away asking him to come back later, after he has had a chance to have his code-breakers look at the evidence. So Geralt heads off to either meditate for a while, or do some side-quests, and then goes back upstairs to get an update.
This new information has pinpointed the location of the third (and hopefully last) cell within the city. There is a snag, however. The cell is in the restricted area of the quarter and therefore inaccessible by conventional means, but there is a workaround: Declan has a spy inside the City Guard.
He tells our hero that he must find an officer currently patrolling the streets and supply a pass phrase. Geralt is less than impressed with this plan and says so, but must reluctantly comply to get on with things. After leaving The New Narakort, he finds a Guard Officer (not to be confused with an "Armored guardsman"). This first Guard Officer tells him to shove off. So he continues his search.
The second Guard Officer the witcher encounters takes exception to the pass phrase attempt and it looks like Geralt is in trouble for a moment. Luckily, the guard is preoccupied with receiving a medal and lets him off with a warning to behave better out on the streets. And the search continues.
The third Guard Officer is, thankfully, the right one. He gives the correct response, after having a little joke at Geralt's expense. He tells the witcher that he will be in the city sewer at midnight and be there for two hours. He then marks the city sewer entrance on the witcher's map, in case he did not already have it. Luckily, the entrance is pretty nearby, close to the Maribor Gate.
The witcher then bides his time until close to midnight (this is the last opportunity to get some xp in the quest Identity by speaking with Triss about Geralts decision earlier in Gold Rush) and then enters the city sewer, heading straight to the opposite end of the tunnel without taking any turns. At the end of the tunnel is the guard officer with a few of his men. A couple more of his men bring in a ladder which prop up under a window. This now allows a new exit from the sewers which emerges in the restricted part of the Trade Quarter - the barricaded northern region.
Geralt emerges from the city sewers in a completely new part of town. He has a look around and then proceeds down a nearby alleyway. At the end of the alley he finds an open door. This must be the place. He enters and his suspicions are confirmed, it is the Salamandra hideout. Inside, he can hear the sounds of several people. He decides to have a closer look.
What he sees are some Salamanders having an "online chat" about securing finances from a mysterious stranger via Hartmann's mirror, a telecommunicator. The stranger basically tells them to look elsewhere for gold. He does not care what they do as long as it does not include him and bids them adieu. It does not take long before the Salamanders notice the witcher is just around the corner watching them and attack. He defends himself with his usual style and grace and, having killed all his would-be executioners, continues downstairs. There, a second wave of Salamanders attacks. The same scenario and outcome ensue.
Now that the carnage is over, the witcher can concentrate on finding more evidence (and more loot). He finds a power stone on the body of one of the Salamanders, a mage. Then he notices that the stranger from the earlier communication is apparently still "online". He approaches the mirror and the stranger compliments the witcher on his swordsmanship. He then introduces himself.
It turns out that this is someone called Radovid. He tells Geralt that he has no intention of financing the criminal organization but that they did have some mutual acquaintances. He does not elaborate on the nature of those contacts, but admits that in the past, he had considered them of possible use at one point. He suggests that he has since changed his mind and no longer desires any sort of alliance with them. He tells the witcher that he is impressed with what he witnessed through the mirror and then cryptically tells the witcher to say hello to Adda and bids him adieu. Transmission over.
That was interesting. Having one last look around, Geralt grabs the strange stone from the three-legged stand in front of the mirror. It seems to be an integral part of the telecommunication and might be of interest to Leuvaarden or Triss. He then leaves the hideout, intent on heading back to the inn to report his findings. Once outside, however, he notices that the area is suddenly crawling with Salamanders. They even seem to be on the rooftops. He decides to take a cautious approach and sneaks up behind one unfortunate individual who really should have gone to the bathroom before leaving for the evening's mischief. One down.
Our hero continues, intent on neutralizing the most recent crop of bad guys. But wait! Before Geralt can dispatch any more of the hooligans, he rounds a corner only to find a werewolf who seems to be "taking care" of the Salamanders, one by one. This beast obviously needs no help from the witcher as he decimates the group of hapless criminals. Interestingly, this werewolf allows a drunken merchant who happens to be passing near the scene to live. Then the beast notices the witcher and the chase is on. Geralt chases him for a while, but then loses sight of him only to be ambushed from above shortly thereafter. He is knocked down, but he gets back up, dusts himself off and continues the chase. Then, the werewolf drops in once more from his rooftop hiding spot and corners the witcher. It is looking bad again for our hero when suddenly the werewolf speaks. He reveals his identity to be none other than captain Vincent!
Vincent the werewolf asks the witcher what he has found out inside the Salamandra hideout. Geralt can tell him or not, depending on how much he wants to cooperate with the beast. They discuss the nature of his "monstrousness" and whether or not the witcher is himself above such a description given the number of deaths directly attributable to his sword. Now Geralt must make a yet another difficult choice: kill this "monster", or let him go. This decision has lasting implications for the game and also advances the Identity quest.
Kill the werewolf: Geralt decides to kill the werewolf, a monster is a monster, and witchers kill monsters. That is all there is to it. A pitched battle ensues and just when the werewolf seems to be on his last legs, he transforms back into his human form and the witcher must face Vincent Meis, in human form. Vincent begs for his life, so again the witcher can choose to spare him, but he does not. Goodbye Vincent the werewolf, rest in peace. or
Spare the werewolf: Geralt decides that despite appearances, Vincent is not a monster at heart, and he lets the werewolf go. Vincent thanks him and then climbs back up to the rooftops from which he appeared and vanishes into the night.
Having dealt with the werewolf, he now needs to find his way back out of the restricted area as he can not go back from whence he came, the chase having left him in a completely different part of the restricted area. He finds that the door to the Old Forge is open. It is the only open door, so he goes in. Lo and behold, in the cellar is Vincent the werewolf's superhero hideaway, complete with weaponry and other interesting stuff. Geralt has a look around and then continues his search for a way out.
He soon discovers a trap door in the floor which leads back to the sewers. So it is back to the sewers. (Maybe he should just clean out a chamber in one of the crypts and move in full-time?) Once he emerges from the underground, our hero heads back to The New Narakort to speak to Declan, but Leuvaarden sends him to talk to Triss Merigold instead as she is the one who knows about magical devices. So it is off to find Triss.
Triss recognizes the stone immediate as a "seeing stone", but she also needs some time to examine it properly. Having no other option, the witcher leaves her in peace to try to locate the source of the last communication. When he returns, she announces that she has located the last position "dialled" using the stone and marks it on his map. Geralt decides to go there straight away, after all, why waste time?
When he enters the building, he finds that it is in fact Radovid's hideout, and Radovid himself is there, in the flesh this time. They speak and Radovid tells the witcher that he knows a few things about Adda and Philippa Eilhart. A bit more conversation and his political agenda becomes apparent. Geralt puts two and two together and realizes that this is "king" Radovid and lets the monarch know he is onto him. This amuses Radovid greatly. They part on relatively good terms, our hero taking his leave to go back and report his findings to Triss and Leuvaarden.
This concludes the quest, and spawns a new quest: The Unforgiven.
Phases.
Leuvaarden's Request.
Leuvaarden asked me to infiltrate the local Salamandra cells. I can pursue that only once I've completed my investigation in the Temple Quarter and the swamp. I should find some of Salamandra's documents in both places. "I need to complete my investigation in the Temple Quarter and the swamp."
The Documents.
I have both of the documents. It's time to see Leuvaarden again. "It's time to see Leuvaarden again."
Analyzing the Documents.
I should return to see Leuvaarden later. He's analyzing the documents found at Salamandra's base. "I should return to see Leuvaarden later." (500 XP)
The Officer.
I am to meet a Temerian officer who is patrolling Vizima. He will direct me to the Salamandra hideout. I have a password, he'll answer with his own. This is all a bit too top secret for my taste, but Leuvaarden seems to think it's necessary... "I'm to meet Leuvaarden's contact. I should search for him among the Temerian soldiers patrolling Vizima's streets."
Fiasco.
OK, failed there. Luckily they had no idea what I was talking about. I must fine the secret agent. "I must find Leuvaarden's secret agent among the officers patrolling Vizima's streets."
Mistaken.
Phew, that was close. Where is that agent? Which of the officers is he? "I must find Leuvaarden's secret agent among the officers patrolling Vizima's streets." (500 XP for the third guy)
The Salamandra Hideout.
I can get to the Salamandra hideout through the sewers. Leuvaarden's allies will leave a ladder for me in one of the sewer branches leading to another part of the Trade Quarter. I'm to be in the sewers at midnight. "I must enter the sewers and meet the secret agent at midnight. Bring the ladder."
Salamandra Territory.
I need to be careful. I'm entering dangerous terrain. The Salamandra hideout is located somewhere up there, in the section of the Trade Quarter that has been closed off. "I must leave the sewer, enter Vizima's Trade Quarter."
The Peeper.
The magic stone! I have a feeling it might be the key to the riddle. I need to get it, but maybe I should do some spying first, see what the Salamanders are up to? "I need to get the magic stone, but maybe I should see what the Salamanders are up to first?"
The Magic Stone.
I have the magic stone. Salamanders use this to contact headquarters. I should show the stone to Triss and Leuvaarden. "I should show the stone to Triss and Leuvaarden." (500 XP)
Radovid.
I told Vincent about Radovid. Why is the king of Redania talking to Salamanders? Are they desperately seeking a new source of funds? "Time to decide what to do with Vincent the werewolf." (500 XP)
Spared the werewolf: Upon leaving the Salamandra hideout I ran into a werewolf who turned out to be Captain Vincent. By all appearances, he is an untamable beast, yet I saw something in his eyes, some hope, so I spared his life for now. I should show the magic stone to Leuvaarden and Triss. "Triss and Leuvaarden need to see the magic stone." (500 XP)
Killed the werewolf: Upon leaving the Salamandra hideout I ran into a wereworf who turned out to be Captain Vincent. There was no hope for him. He had turned into an untamable beast, so I had to kill him. I should show the magic stone to Leuvaarden and Triss. "Triss and Leuvaarden must see the magic stone." (1000 XP)
To Triss.
Leuvaarden knows nothing about magic. He sent me to Triss. "I should ask Triss about the magic stone."
A Plan.
I need to get back to the banquet in a while to see what Triss and Leuvaarden agreed on. "I should get back to the banquet and speak with Triss or Leuvaarden." (2500 XP)
Investigation Complete.
I destroyed the Salamandra den in the Trade Quarter and learned the location of their base. They won't get away this time. "I've completed my investigation. Time to confront the guilty."

 &lt;data source="id"&gt;&lt;label&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Identity is technically a secondary quest, but it is central to the plot of "The Witcher". Through this quest, Geralt develops his sense of self-identity.
Walkthrough.
At the beginning of "The Witcher", the witchers of Kaer Morhen find our hero, Geralt of Rivia, unconscious and suffering from amnesia. They take him back to the fortress where he is nursed back to physical health, but he still needs to recover his memory. This quest follows that search to a certain extent. It spans the entire game and is not even technically complete by the end of the game.
As Geralt engages in discussions with various and makes decisions regarding other quests, many of his choices have an impact on his concept of personal identity; meaning that you, the player, shape his identity depending on the actions you decide to have him take. This quest is updated one way or another as the game unfolds.
Chapter III is where the witcher really begins to delve into his own motivations and choices, with the help of Triss Merigold, an old friend. It is the sorceress who suggests to Geralt that he should take his amnesia in hand and work to solidify his identity. She refuses to tell him what he used to be like, insisting rather that he create his own persona, or recreate it as the case may be. Since our hero is not one to whine, he sucks it up and begins his journey of self-discovery, checking in periodically with Triss.
Phases.
Psyche.
Triss is suggesting there is something wrong with my psyche. Maybe I should talk to her about it. "Maybe I should talk to Triss about the problems with my psyche."
Memory.
Triss can't restore my memory, even using magic. The sorceress advised me not to seek the truth based on what people say about the past, because I may produce a false image of myself. Should I trust my impulses, emotions and thoughts, then? Is that the way to rebuild my identity? "Perhaps speaking with people who once knew me will help me recover my memory."
Motivation.
Thaler asked what motivates me. That got me thinking about myself.
I realized I'm pursuing the Salamandra thugs not only for personal reasons - revenge and the desire to punish the bastards - but that I'm also motivated by ideology. I feel I'm one of the witchers. I should be true not so much to the tradition as to my friends from Kaer Morhen. "Thaler made me realize that my motivations are complex." (2000 XP)
I realized I want to punish the bastards who came after me, who tried to kill or cross me. No doubt about it: I'm after Salamandra and it's personal. "Thaler made me realize that this has become personal for me." (2000 XP)
I realized I want to punish Leo's murderers and the thieves who made off with the witchers' secrets because I am a child of Kaer Morhen. I am a witcher and I was created to pursue monsters. "Thaler made me realize that I'm driven by the fact that I'm a witcher." (2000 XP)
The Scoia'tael / The Order.
Note: Once you have received the "Monsters" entry below you can only talk to Triss about why you made your decision, but it will not add an additional entry in the quest journal and you will not receive the bonus XP.
Scoia'tael path: Why am I working with the nonhumans?
Coincidences can't explain everything. As a witcher, I identify with the nonhumans - like them, I feel ostracized, hounded and alienated. The Scoia'tael will help me achieve my goals, and I'll fight for my rights alongside them. "I realized I'm working with the Scoia'tael because I feel humans persecute me. "(2000 XP)
Coincidences can't explain everything. I think I understand the ideals of the Scoia'tael, who are hounded and ostracized like witchers. But I disagree with Scoia'tael methods. I would even call some of Yaevinn's decisions juvenile and harmful to the cause of the nonhumans. "I realized I'm working with the Scoia'tael because I share their ideals, though I disagree with some of their methods. "(2000 XP)
I realized my choice has no deeper meaning. I have a job to do and I'll use all available means, including the help of the Scoia'tael, to complete it. "I realized I'm working with the Scoia'tael because their help is a means toward achieving my goal." (2000 XP)
Order path: Why am I working with the Order?
Coincidences can't explain everything. Though a witcher, I also feel I'm human and hold dear at least some of the Order's ideals. "I realized I'm working with the Order because I still feel I'm human. "(2000 XP)
For purposes of my own, I had to choose a side and I just don't understand the nonhumans. It's not just about Yaevinn's juvenile ways that he tries to conceal behind lofty slogans. Elves and dwarves are alien to me, fundamentally different. "I realized I'm working with the Order because the elves and dwarves are alien to me. "(2000 XP)
I realized my choice has no deeper meaning. I have a job to do and I'll use any available means, including the Order's help, to complete it. "I realized I'm working with the Order because its aid is a means toward achieving my goal." (2000 XP)
Monsters.
Spared the werewolf: They say that witchers kill all monsters without exception and that the Witchers' Code is a mere legend. That may be true, but I can distinguish both the human in a monster and the monster in a human. The werewolf Vincent should not have perished at the hand of a witcher. On the other hand, the bastards that I'm after should. "I believe that not every monster deserves to die." (2500 XP)
Killed the werewolf: I'm a witcher. The mutations and training I underwent were a stronger influence than I thought. A monster is nothing more than a monster to me, a threat. I was created to annihilate threats. "I believe a monster is a threat that needs to be annihilated." (1500 XP)
Identity.
I spoke with Dandelion about killing humans.
I admitted that I don't enjoy killing and I only use it as a last resort. "I realize that I don't like killing and I resort to it only when necessary."
I admitted I only kill humans when I think they deserve to die. "I realize I have no objections to killing humans if I believe they deserve to die."
I had to admit I have absolutely no objections... "I realize that I have no objections to killing humans."
Destiny.
I don't believe in destiny. I shape my own fate. I talked to the Lady of the Lake and realized that the success of this mission depends entirely on me. I am fully responsible for my actions and failure will be entirely my fault. I will also take all the credit for my success. "I realized that I don't believe in destiny and that I'm responsible for both my successes and failures."
I sometimes claim that I don't believe in destiny, but after talking to the Lady of the Lake I have to acknowledge it affects my life. Its forces may have brought me back to this world. My return coincided with the attack on Kaer Morhen, and that was no accident. I have been assigned a task and though I don't know if I'll succeed or fail, I will try to complete it. "I realized I tread the paths destiny traces before me and I have a mission to complete."
I spoke with the Lady of the Lake about destiny, and still I'm unable to say how it affects my life. Do I believe in destiny? I believe in something more. "I cannot say what influence destiny has on my life."
Love.
Triss:
Foltest and I talked about the women in my life and I realized I have feelings for Triss. My amnesia prevents me from remembering our relations in the past, but I have the impression I once loved a sorceress, deeply... Triss suggested how I might regain my memory, and I think that at heart she wants me to realize she was the love of my life. "I realize now that Triss is the love of my life." (5000 XP)
Foltest and I talked about women, and I thought about my relationship with Triss. The sorceress is important to me, but I would not say I love her. Triss may be looking for something more, but I'm not ready and I may, in fact, never be ready to love her truly. "I realize that though I feel good with Triss, I'm not truly ready to love her." (5000 XP)
Foltest and I talked about women, and I thought about my relationship with Triss. The sorceress is a true friend and the sex doesn't seem to be spoiling that. "I realize that Triss is first and foremost my friend." (5000 XP)
Shani:
Foltest and I talked about the women in my life, and I realized that I have feelings for Shani. The medic has really turned my world upside down. I never thought a passing love affair would grow into something serious. Yes, I think I can call our relationship love. "I realize that my relationship with Shani is something more. I think I love her..." (5000 XP)
Foltest and I talked about the women in my life. I think that Shani and I have grown really close. I'd hardly call it love, but the young medic has become very important to me. "I realize Shani is very important to me, though I wouldn't call our relationship love." (5000 XP)
Foltest and I talked about women, and I thought about my relationship with Shani. The medic is a true friend and the sex doesn't seem to be spoiling anything. "I realize that Shani is first and foremost my friend." (5000 XP)
I completed my task and I feel extremely tired. I do not long for glory, I do not enjoy victory. I leave blood and ashes behind me and all I desire is solace. I would like to come back to a place from where I got to the walls of Kaer Morhen. I long for peace and oblivion. "I completed my task but I feel tired and all I want is solace. I would like to go back whence I came."
I've completed my task and only now feel that I'm a free man. I have come a long way and in the process liberated myself from the forces that brought me to the walls of Kaer Morhen. Perhaps I was a free man from the beginning and just needed time to recover my identity. That's no longer important. It's time I set out again, took on new challenges. "I've completed my task and am content. I feel as a man reborn."
I have recovered the secrets of Kaer Morhen but have regained nothing of my memory. I have come a long way along which I made important choices. Some I would repeat, others I regret. Have I recovered my identity? That is a question I am not ready to answer. "I've completed my task but feel this is not yet the end. I will see what time brings."

After the player turns in all 10 trophies they can talk to the Royal Huntsman again; he offers a choice between a steel sword and a silver sword. The steel sword is the Mahakaman Rune Sihill, and the silver sword is Moonblade.

Cintra (Elder Speech: "Xin'trea") is one of the Northern Kingdoms, located south of Sodden, Riverdell, and the great river Yaruga.
Cintra was a very powerful kingdom in the times of Queen Calanthe, but was conquered by Nilfgaard during the First Nilfgaard War. After the Second Nilfgaard War, the kingdom was nominally an independent state, but was actually ruled by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard because of his marriage to Empress Cirilla, also known as False Ciri.
Cintra's neighbors are Sodden, Brugge, and the Nilfgaard province of Nazair. When Emhyr var Emreis proclaimed False Ciri queen, he also named her princess of Brugge, duchess of Sodden, heir of Skellige, and sovereign of Attre and Abb Yarra.
History.
Ancient Times.
Once known as the elven city of Xin'trea, Cintra was built on its ruins after the eastern expansion of humans approximately five hundred years ago, and the abandonment of the city by the elves.
Northern Wars.
In 1263, after the continued expansion of the Nilfgaardian Empire to the Amell Mountains, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis began a full scale invasion of the North, beginning with the kingdom of Cintra. The Nilfgaardian Army crossed the Marnadal Stairs and crushed the Cintran Army at the mouth of the mountain pass, which became later known as the Battle of Marnadal. They continued north and slaughtered the kingdom's fortified capital, killing nearly the entire royal family, with Queen Calanthe committing suicide rather than be captured. Many of the capital's residents were left homeless and fled to nearby Verden, Temeria, Brugge, and Skellige.
After marching north and being defeated at the Battle of Sodden Hill, the Nilfgaardian Army marched south again and took control of the occupied lands of Cintra and Upper Sodden.
National Emblems.
For time immemorial, in the kingdom of Cintra's coat of arms three golden lions on azure have been. They say that under this very emblem the ancestors of Cintrans entered the Yaruga Mouth ages ago and that this very emblem was adopted as the coat of arms by their Chieftain. The House of Ravens–Cerbins used these arms in days of yore and such they are now adayes: Azure, three lions passant Or, onely that since the reign of King Coram II the lions are crowned.- "Coats of Arms of the Respectable Royal and Knightly Houses, their blazon and history",  Dynastic descriptions: Cintran Dynasty, Coram IIThe images below depicts historical and alternative coats of arms and flags; for the most recent versions established by King Coram II, see the infobox.

All the King's Men is a quest in Chapter III which begins when Triss explains to Geralt that the district is under martial law. She gives the witcher the pass he will require simply to be allowed to walk the streets of the Trade Quarter. This quest spans all of Chapter III.
Walkthrough.
At the beginning of Chapter III, we find our hero unconscious in Triss Merigold's bedroom at her luxurious home in the Trade Quarter. After he regains consciousness, the sorceress begins filling him in on what has happened since his battle with Azar Javed at the Mage's tower.
After a few preliminaries, like checking the witcher for internal injuries, Triss hands him a pass, explaining that the quarter is under martial law and that he must carry this pass in order to be allowed even to walk in the street. Geralt is sceptical but takes the pass anyway and heads off to continue his investigations. As he goes to leave, the sorceress remembers that they have been invited to a reception at The New Narakort that evening at 18:00. She tells the witcher that he really must go and that she will meet him there.
No sooner does he step foot outside than he is accosted by a City Guard officer who demands to see his pass immediately. They exchange a few words on the subject with the witcher pointing out that the zeal with which the passes are being checked is a bit over the top. The officer quickly puts the witcher in his place, reminding him that it is only at his leniency that Geralt may walk the streets at all. They both continue on their separate ways.
Later that evening, during the reception, after having complied with all his social obligations, Geralt decides to get some air and goes outside. In the square outside the inn, he comes upon a foreboding little scene. He can see Thaler and Count de Wett, surrounded by guards, having an argument.
At this point the witcher must again decide where his allegiance lies. He can approach either one of them and find out what this is all about. He decides to do the polite thing and hear both sides before drawing any conclusions.
He speaks to Thaler who points out that there is no signature on some of the edicts bearing the Royal seal. This is very suspicious and he accuses the Count of knowing more than he is letting on. The witcher then speaks to de Wett who asserts that Thaler is only questioning the authenticity of the edicts because one of them strips him of his position as chief of Temerian Intelligence. The count also suggests that not all Royal edicts require a signature, the seal is sufficient. Furthermore, he demands that the witcher kill Thaler then and there. Having heard both sides, Geralt makes his decision:
Kill Thaler:
Our hero sees the sense in de Wett's argument, and Thaler has been less than forthcoming with information, "plus" he dated Shani (the bastard!), so he kills the fence for which the Count is very grateful. De Wett assures Geralt that the Order will also be very grateful.
Defend Thaler:
Our hero is outraged at the suggestion of killing Thaler. He is definitely troubled by what the fence has revealed about the edicts and de Wett (the weasel!) is not helping by making wild accusations. Geralt refuses to kill Thaler and incurs the wrath of the Count. Thaler is grateful and suggests they go back to the Inn and discuss the situation further, so it is back to the banquet.
Walk away:
Geralt just leaves the scene. He can then watch how the order knights kill Thaler but is unable to help him. Geralt comments that he needs to stay out of politics.
Back inside, Thaler gives Geralt a few more tidbits of information (if the witcher let him live, otherwise he is not much of a source of information after the incident in the courtyard). It is not until the witcher completes the Lock and Key quest for Leuvaarden that he gets any more information to further this part of his investigation.
Lock and Key reveals the identity of Radovid, king of Redania and his whereabouts. This in turn allows the witcher to have a chat with the monarch and glean some more information, specifically regarding Adda's involvement. He only uncovers the final pieces of the puzzle during The Unforgiven. Princess Adda, in league with Salamandra, is the one who forged the edicts.
This quest and The Unforgiven end simultaneously.
Phases.
A Letter of Safe Conduct.
Triss gave me a letter of safe conduct which allows me to stay in the Trade Quarter. Why did Velerad declare a state of emergency? "A state of emergency has been declared in Vizima. I must keep that in mind as I move around. I don't need any more trouble."
The Officer.
I met an officer who ordered me to show him my pass. Something's fishy. Did the king order Velerad to declare the state of emergency? "Though I might want to stay clear of politics, I sense that's impossible in Vizima. I don't aim to look for trouble though."
Thaler's Death / Thaler / A Forgery.
Geralt ignored this bit of intrigue:
Thaler's Death.
I saw Thaler killed by members of the Temerian Militia. I could ask around, learn more... But I should see how things develop. "I need to stay clear of the political scheming." (500 XP)
Geralt sides with De Wett:
Thaler.
I met Thaler, he was arguing with De Wett. He lost his position as chief of Temerian intelligence and refuses to accept that. "I'm involved in the conflict now and I need to kill Thaler."
Thaler's Death.
Thaler had to die, the situation required it. De Wett thanked me for my help, but asked me to forget the whole matter. He headed toward the guard post. "I've landed in a political cesspool. I can't let myself sink any deeper." (500 XP)
A Nervous Reaction.
Strange... De Wett got nervous when I asked about the royal edicts. Did I make the wrong decision? I should see how things develop. "De Wett reacts nervously at any mention of royal edicts. I should see how things develop." (500 XP)
Geralt defends Thaler:
A Forgery.
I ran into Thaler and De Wett. They were arguing. It seems the edict dismissing Thaler from his post was forged." Thaler claims the edict dismissing him from his post is a forgery."
The Conversation Continues.
Thaler thanked me for helping him during his confrontation with De Wett. He said we would speak further at the New Narakort. "Thaler invited me to join him at the New Narakort." (500 XP)
The King's Signature.
Thaler has a royal edict that appoints him caretaker of Vizima in the king's absence. The document bears the king's signature and his seal. It looks like the unsigned edicts are, in fact, forged. I should keep my eyes open and see how things develop. "Foltest's authority seems tenuous. I'll be glad to get back to my own matters." (1500 XP)
Radovid's Projection.
I spoke to a teleprojection of someone named Radovid, who is clearly funding Salamandra. I need to learn more. "Salamandra, political schemes, a magic mirror... I'll see how things develop."
Triss Helps.
Triss seemed to know how to use the magic stone at the Salamandra hideout. Maybe she can also help me figure out Radovid? I must ask her about the communicator. In private." I should ask Triss about tracing Radovid using the magic stone. We need to speak in private."
The Communication Stone.
Triss told me the Salamanders couldn't possibly use the stone to communicate with anyone at a great distance. The person they talked to is in Vizima. Triss managed to calculate where the signal might have come from. She marked the spot on the map. "Triss marked the destination of the magic signal from the stone."
Radovid of Redania.
I met Radovid himself. He is deeply involved in the schemes afoot in Vizima, knows everything about the forged edicts and seems very interested in Princess Adda. And, of course, he rules neighboring Redania. In some way, I've learned too much. Dealing with kings is never wise." I'll never get Salamandra this way. I won't risk meddling in the matters of monarchs." (500 XP)
The Princess's Scheme.
It's clear now. It was Adda, the king's daughter, who forged her father's edicts. Unfortunately, the princess knows that I know, so I can't go back to Vizima. "Adda was behind the forged edicts. I have gained a powerful enemy in the city and cannot return to Vizima for the time being." (2000 XP)

In Chapter III, shortly after leaving The New Narakort following the banquet (if certain conditions have been fulfilled - see below), the witcher is accosted by a young boy who tells him that the bank is being robbed and that Velerad has sent for him. So begins Gold Rush.
Walkthrough.
At a certain point in Chapter III, a child will inform you about a robbery in progress at the Vivaldi and Sons bank - this marks the beginning of the quest. There is a large crowd in front of the bank (behind the town hall, facing Tanners Square) and Velerad is among them.
Speak with Velerad. He explains the situation and (depending on which path you have been following) how to enter the bank.
If you choose to help Yaevinn, the conversation options look like Geralt intends to work alone. Ask if there is another way in; this prompts Velerad to suggest entering via an adjacent warehouse and provide the necessary key. Once inside, kill the fleders, proceed to the second floor, kill more fleders, and pass through a door to the upper floor of the town hall. From there, go downstairs and into the bank (the door at the bottom of the stairs).
Once inside the bank proper, if you have completed Echoes of Yesterday, you will have a short chat with Ren Grouver who will tell you that he is not a good negotiator, and to proceed to the basement and speak with Yaevinn. Otherwise, one of the Scoia'tael swordsmen (determined randomly) will ask Geralt if he is there to negotiate when spoken to. Answering in the negative will cause the Scoia'tael to attack and the quest automatically selects for the Order path. Answering in the affirmative causes the elf to tell Geralt to go to the basement to see Yaevinn. You will get one last chance change your mind when you find Yaevinn, but this is the Scoia'tael path description so you will stick with him. This means killing off a few kikimora blocking his means of escape.
If you choose to help Siegfried, you will enter through the town hall and meet the knight inside where he will basically tell you to kill the elves. You can argue, but if you want to stick with the Order, you will be forced to kill the elves. Yaevinn, however, will manage to get away and come back to say some nasty things to you later. - You can combine this by using the profitable way through the warehouse and nevertheless helping the order.
If you choose to work alone, you can try all you want, but you will have to choose a side. I do not think you can get away with helping neither side.
No matter how the plot unfolds, Yaevinn makes a getaway and goes into hiding. This concludes the quest. If you need to find Yaevinn from this stage on, he will be at Golan Vivaldi's house, but if you did not side with him, there is not much point.
Phases.
The Bank Robbery.
Some kid ran up to me and told me Vivaldi's bank in the Trade Quarter is being robbed. I should take a closer look. "Someone is robbing Vivaldi's bank. I should see what's going on."
Enter alone:
I've decided to enter the bank through the back door. I need to pass through the warehouse and use the link on the upper floor. "I'll enter the bank through the warehouse." (1000 XP)
I met Grouver, the same guy I helped "retrieve the artwork". I should have known it was about tunneling through to the bank. I should talk to Yaevinn - they say he's downstairs. "I should talk to Yaevinn. He's downstairs." 
The Tunnel.
Help Siegfried:
I should find Siegfried, decide what to do about the bank robbery. "I should speak to Siegfried." (500 XP)
Siegfried is waiting for me by the bank. We're going in on my signal. "I should join Siegfried by the bank and enter the building with him."
I need to pull Siegfried out of the bank. The bold knight decided to launch an attack on his own. "I have to get Siegfried out of the bank."
Siegfreid and I decided to enter the bank the back way, through town hall. "We're going in to the bank through the back! Through town hall!"
Hmmm, Siegfried isn't really willing to negotiate. All right, we'll have to do it his way. I'll follow him into the bank. "It's decided. The elven terrorists must die."
Failed Negotiations.
Siding with Siegfried:
Sad as it is, Grouver wasn't looking for a peaceful resolution. I must go below and nab Yaevinn. "I must go downstairs and get Yaevinn."
Failed Negotiations.
Trying to stay neutral:
I must descend to the vault. I'm sure to find the elven leader there. "I must descend and find the leader of the elves."
The Vault.
Siding with Yaevinn:
I stopped Siegfried from attempting an all out slaughter of the Scoia'tael. I've decided to negotiate with them. I'll enter the bank alone. "I've decided to negotiate with the Scoia'tael. I'm entering the bank alone."
Grouver told me to go downstairs. I can talk to Yaevinn there. "I should go downstairs and talk to Yaevinn."
The Choice.
I spoke with Yaevinn... I need to decide whether to side with him and his Scoia'tael fighters or with the Order of the Flaming Rose. "I should decide whether to side with the Scoia'tael or with the Order of the Flaming Rose." (5000 XP)
Negotiations Collapse.
Grouver decided against a peaceful resolution. Sad as it is... I must go below and nab Yaevinn. "I must go below and nab Yaevinn."
Helped Yaevinn:
I promised to help Yaevinn get through the sewers. I must clear the way of all monsters. I'll use the tunnel the elves used to enter the bank. "I must clear the way through the sewers of all monsters."
I killed the creatures in the sewer. Time to talk to Yaevinn. "The monsters are dead, the passage is clear."
Yaevinn managed to escape to Vivaldi's house. The elf gave the banker the documents he recovered. Yaevinn owes me. I know where to find him if I need to talk to him. "Yaevinn has found refuge at Vivaldi's. The elf owes me a debt of gratitude." (3000 XP)
The Fugitive.
Foiled Yaevinn:
Yaevinn fled into the sewers. Can I catch him? I must follow him through the tunnel the Scoia'tael used to get here. "I must follow Yaevinn through the tunnel the Scoia'tael used to enter the bank."
Unfortunately, Yaevinn managed to escape. I should inform burgomeister Velerad. "Velerad needs to learn of Yaevinn's escape."
The bank case is closed. Unfortunately, Yaevinn managed to escape, but Siegfried is grateful and he's sure to help me when I need him. "Yaevinn escaped, but Siegfried is grateful and owes me a favor." (3000 XP)

Payment.
Job done. Siegfried paid me in gold for the drowned dead tongues. "I received my reward for the tongues of the drowned dead." (150 + 2000 XP)

Eternal Fire signet ring is a fancy gold ring in "The Witcher" with a red stone that is given to Geralt by the Reverend in Chapter I as a sign of his approval. Without it, none of the Outskirts' more prominent citizens will speak with the witcher. Although this ring can not be bought initially, once acquired, it can be sold and then repurchased.
This signet ring can also be obtained in exchange for a White Gull potion from a beggar (an old woman) in the Outskirts who wants it to ease her dying grandson's suffering. Apparently the Reverend had refused to help her grandson who is dying from the plague, so the old woman stole his ring.

City Guard signet ring, is given to Geralt by Vincent Meis in Chapter II only after the witcher finds irrefutable proof that the captain is not involved with Salamandra. It allows entry into one of two semi-restricted areas within the Temple Quarter: the dike and St. Lebioda's Hospital. Although this ring can not be bought initially, once acquired, it can be sold and then repurchased.
Depending on how the plot has unfolded, Geralt obtains this ring for one of two purposes, either to gain access to the Swamp "via" the dike or to access St. Lebioda's Hospital.
Access to the Hospital.
If Geralt teams up with Siegfried to fight the cockatrice in Prison Break, then the hospital is guarded by a city guard who requires either the signet ring or a bribe of ~50 (sometimes less is fine but 50 is safe) before he will let Geralt enter. However, Siegfried waits by the gates to the dike until Geralt arrives and vouches for him when he tries to go to the dike, securing passage to the swamp.
Access to the Dike.
If Geralt worked alone in the sewers, then the signet ring is helpful to gain access to the dike. Siegfried will vouch for Geralt at the hospital, which allows him to enter without the ring. The guards at the dike, however, need to be presented with the signet ring, or bribed with 55 to let Geralt pass.

Angus was a local drug dealer who was known to the City Guard, well, at least to Jethro. He was a shady character who can usually be found standing on the corner near The Hairy Bear, the kitty-corner from the Eager Thighs brothel, or in the slums of the Temple Quarter.
Geralt must find Angus and get from him information about the Salamandra drug trade in Vizima. It is from him that Geralt gets the information to locate the Salamandra hideout where the manufacture of fisstech seems to be based. He can get this information either by paying the dealer for a letter of recommendation in order to enter the drug lab with minimal fuss or taking that same letter from him by force. Alternatively, our hero can simply enter the lab using force and dispense with the letter altogether.

Letter of safe conduct
"The bearer of this letter has the right to be on the streets of the Trade Quarter during daytime, despite the ban on movement introduced under the state of emergency."

The Viziman Connection is a quest in Chapter III given by Jethro to Geralt after the latter has cleared out the Salamandra hideout in the sewers.
Walkthrough.
After slogging his way through the fisstech lab for Jethro, Geralt emerges from the crypt only to be greeted by the guard who is once again barking orders. This time the witcher has had enough and tells the jailer so in no uncertain terms, but concedes that he will still help, given that Jethro is in no shape to finish the job due to his "little habit".
The guard tells the witcher that Gellert, the drug lord, is not far away and should be "taken care of" without delay, marking the spot on the map and then heads back to the dungeon. Geralt, on the other hand, heads off to find Bleinheim who is in an area in the southern section of the sewers which had previously been inaccessible due to a locked iron gate. (This is the gate which is opposite the nook where the dead knight with the key to the Lionhead Spider Cultists' lair was found).
He proceeds through the gate and keeps bearing south until he spies a bunch of Salamanders, including Gellert Bleinheim. No sooner has he seen them, than they see him and as usual swordplay (and maybe the casting of a few signs - for fun) ensues. It seems the closer the witcher gets to his goal, the better armed his adversaries are, but in the end, he prevails (did you ever doubt it?).
He searches the bodies collecting what loot he finds interesting until he finds Gellert Bleinheim's dead body. On that corpse, he finds the same weapons as he found on Roland Bleinheim in the swamp: an illegal sword and an assassin's dagger; and two letters: the Royal letter of safe conduct, identical to the one his brother had, and the key to the Salamandra code. Then he goes to find Jethro at his usual post, the dungeon, and report that the mission has been accomplished. One dead drug lord, as requested.
Phases.
Deliveries.
Jethro in one annoying guy. I conducted the entire investigation for him and now he leaves me to deal with one of the Salamandra bosses. Gellert's letter must contain more information. "Gellert's letter must contain more information."
Deliveries in the Sewer.
According to Gellert's letter, the ingredients are delivered to the sewers - by the big grate, whatever that means. "The ingredients are delivered to whatever is beyond the big grate in the sewers."
Gellert.
Gellert proved a strong and aggressive opponent. He seemed to be protecting something, desperately. "I must search the bandit's corpse."
The Amulet.
I found a strange amulet inscribed with a series of letters on Gellert's body. I should tell Jethro that I killed Gellert. "I should tell Jethro that I killed Gellert." (1000 XP)
Job Done.
Jethro paid me for dismantling the Salamandra cell in the Temple Quarter. Job done. I should review Leuvaarden's clues. I need a break, a new lead. "I need a new lead. Where do I look?" (200 + 4000 XP)

Old Friend of Mine is a quest which begins after Geralt has won his freedom from prison and begun checking out the Temple Quarter in Chapter II. He finds Shani, whom he rescued from the Outskirts Inn in Chapter I... and so begins the quest.
Walkthrough.
This quest is also known as "Shani's Party", but it begins much earlier and only culminates in the gathering at her place. The eponymous "old friend" is Shani herself, but at the party we are properly introduced to Dandelion whom we are told is Geralt's best friend, so the title could be said to refer to two old friends, not just one. (see Notes)
The quest itself actually begins when Geralt first encounters Shani (either at St. Lebioda's hospital during her working hours, at home, or while she walks from one to the other). They converse about her work and the plague situation, which leads the medic to ask the witcher to gather five bundles of celandine (which he may already have from his travels in the outskirts) for the patients. If the herb is delivered to the hospital and Geralt asks Shani for a monster anatomy lesson, she will teach him about drowned dead, bloedzuigers, or fleders.
Later our hero must ask for Shani's help with an unofficial autopsy. The "crown witness" in the Salamandra investigation has been killed and someone needs to get to the bottom of things. This collaborative effort largely shapes the direction of several related quests. It is only the third time they meet that the witcher gets to have a more social exchange with Shani. She mentions that she is having a little gathering in honour of Dandelion, an old friend and celebrated bard who is in town. However, before the party actually begins, Shani needs Geralt to do a little grocery shopping for her. Geralt must go purchase the liquor for the party. Shani request some Mettina Rose, Temerian Rye and some Cherry Cordial Spirit. All of these can be purchased at the Hairy Bear Inn in the slums.
Shani's party takes place almost entirely upstairs, and the conversation is mainly being between Dandelion and Geralt. He tells the witcher about higher vampires and his old friend Regis, who was one. Geralt scoffs and asks derisively if he also had a dragon friend. (In the books, he did!) Geralt also converses with Shani, who tells him more about the Battle of Brenna, which elicits some (possibly drunken) praise from our hero. As the party wears on, the invited guest (either Zoltan Chivay, Siegfried or Carmen) arrives and joins the party.
Soon, the guest suggests a caper involving sending Geralt downstairs to forage for some item. (Zoltan is hungry and would like some pickles and lard. Siegfried would like to have some cordial. Carmen suggests playing truth or dare; the dare is to take something from Grandma downstairs.) Naturally, Geralt goes to fetch the item in question. While downstairs he has to avoid the fireplaces, otherwise Grandma catches him drunk and kicks him out of the house.
A bit more conversation follows; then it is time for a song from the guest of honor.
Zoltan is Geralt's guest: When Dandelion sings (a rather amusing ballad about a wolf - hmmm), you notice that Geralt and Shani are playing a little game. He looks at her, she turns away. He turns away, she looks back. Finally their eyes meet. Very sweet... and the party ends on a good note.
Siegfried is Geralt's guest: When Dandelion sings, Siegfried joins in and sings too. Shani's impressed with him, and for a while it looks like she is going after Siegfried, but he does not reciprocate - the silly boy has taken a vow of celibacy! (Though he does not actually say so.) The party ends on a good note.
Carmen is Geralt's guest: When Dandelion sings, Carmen starts acting in a decidedly unladylike manner around Geralt - much to the consternation of Shani. One thing leads to another and basically, a cat-fight breaks out. The party ends on a less-than-good note.
Geralt is probably wasted at this point, and usually ends up passed out on the ground just outside of Shani's house. After picking himself up, he decides to bring her some flowers to say thank you (or should that be sorry?). He asks what Dandelion meant the other night when he said he had interrupted them in Oxenfurt. Shani decides that showing the witcher would be easier than explaining ... cue the soft lights and music.
Dandelion's songs.
Song for Zoltan
"By the woods can you see,Wolf in all his mightGrinning madly, wagging gladly,bouncing with delight."
"My, oh my, what a sight!Why no melancholy?Must be that still not wed,that is why so jolly."
"Aoo, aaoo, aoo!"
"In the grass can you see,Wolf just limps along,Looking down, awful frown,crying like a dog."
"Why is this mighty beastso badly rampaged?Must be that freshly wedor lately engaged."
"Aoo, aoo, aoo!"
Song for Siegfried
"Autumn's scents have pervaded the air,""The wind stole the words from our lips,""That's the way it must be, please don't shed,""Those diamonds that run down your cheeks."
"Your home all surrounded by snow,""Glassy frost covers rivers and lakes,""That's the way it must be, please don't show,""This yearning and grief on your face."
"When the spring comes along with the rain,""The sun will warm up us both,""That's the way it must be for we burn,"
"With fire eternal like hope."
Song for Carmen
"It's no wonder dazzling ladies""are so hard to score,""Like them maples reaching higher,""more it takes to soar."
"Yet with ladies and maples,""there's no need to frown.""Lay them down, on the ground,"
"and the game is done."
Phases.
Shani.
Shani is a great girl. Maybe I should stick around a little bit, see how things go? "I should visit Shani in the hospital. Maybe she could use a hand."
Celandine.
Shani asked me for a small favor - she needs five bunches of celandine. I couldn't say no. I need to go to the swamp, that is where it is supposed to grow. "I am to go to the swamps and gather 5 bunches of celandine."
To the Hospital.
I have the herbs Shani asked me to gather. Now I have to bring them to the hospital. "I must bring the herbs to the hospital."
A Favor.
I got celandine for Shani. I'm in her good books now. I need to talk to her more often, maybe she'll ask me for another favor? For now I think she owes me one. "I think Shani owes me one. I should talk to Shani more often." (500 XP)
The Autopsy.
The autopsy is finished with Shani's aid. The poor thing is very tired - she should rest now. I reckon there is something she wants of me. Maybe I should talk to her when she finishes her work. "Shani was very helpful. I should visit her one day."
The Party.
I promised Shani I'd bring alcohol to the party. She wanted some rosé wine, and some cherry liquor for Dandelion. I prefer rye vodka. "I must supply Shani with rosé wine, cherry liquor and Temerian rye vodka."
Alcohol.
I need to find some rosé wine, cherry cordial and Temerian rye vodka to bring to Shani's. "I have the alcohol. Now to get it to Shani." (500 XP)
Invitation.
I brought Shani the alcohol, it's time I thought about my companion. Whom should I invite? I must consider the people I know, perhaps somebody wants to join the party. "I must invite one person to Shani's party."
Zoltan: I invited Zoltan to the party. Now I should go to Shani's house. "I invited Zoltan to the party at Shani's place. I should go there." (500 XP)
Siegfried: I invited Siegfried to the party. Now I should go to Shani's house. "I invited Siegfried to the party at Shani's place. I should go there." (500 XP)
Carmen: I invited Carmen to the party. Now I should go to Shani's house. "I invited Carmen to the party at Shani's place. I should go there." (−100 + 500 XP)
Zoltan: Yet another person reacts rather weirdly upon seeing me. Dandelion maintains he saw me die. I think I need a drink. "I think I need a drink."
Siegfried: Another person who reacts in a strange way to my presence. Dandelion claims he witnessed my death. I need a drink. "I need a drink."
Carmen: Yet another person reacts rather weirdly upon seeing me. Dandelion maintains he saw me die. I think I need a drink. "I think I need a drink."
Zoltan: Me and Dandelion had a discussion. My head is spinning... "The party is going on..."
Siegfried: I had a discussion with Dandelion. My head is spinning... "The party is going on..."
Carmen: Me and Dandelion had a discussion. My head is spinning... "The party is going on..."
Zoltan: At this pace some of the guests will end up under the table rather soon... "The party is going on..."
Siegfried: If we keep the pace, soon some of the guests will fall off their chairs... "The party is going on..."
Carmen: At this pace some of the guests will end up under the table rather soon... "The party is going on..."
Zoltan: Zoltan asked me to bring him some pickes and lard from grandma downstairs. Considering the state I'm in, this might be hard to achieve without making a hell of a lot of noise. But hey, I am a witcher after all... "Zoltan asked me to bring him some pickles and lard from grandma downstairs."
Siegfried: I promised Siegfried I'd bring him some fruit liquor from grandma's cupboard downstairs. At this stage of the party it might be difficult to do it without making a lot of noise. On the other hand... I am still a witcher, aren't I? "I promised Siegfried that I bring him some liquor from grandma's cupboard downstairs."
Carmen: I am to bring something interesting from grandma. Considering the state I'm in, this might be hard to achieve without making a hell of a lot of noise. But hey, I am a witcher after all... "I have to bring something interesting from grandma downstairs."
Zoltan: Well done, got the lard and the pickles. "I have to take the lard and the pickles upstairs."
Siegfried: Well done, I have the liquor. "I must take the liquor upstairs.."
Carmen: Well done, I've got grandma's diary. "I have to take grandma's diary upstairs."
A Song.
Dandelion decided to sing something. Let's see what he has prepared for this occasion... "Let's see what Dandelion sings."
Flowers.
The party is over. I'll sure be hung-over in the morning... Maybe I should visit Shani, bring her some roses and say thanks? "Perhaps it would be a good idea to bring Shani some roses and say thanks? "(500 XP)
Reminiscences.
Shani reminded me of certain interesting events from my past. Very interesting events. "Shani reminded me of certain interesting events from my past." (1500 XP)
Failed.
I've missed my chance. I devoted too much time to the investigation, not enough to Shani. I'd really like to get to know Shani better - again... I missed that chance.

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Menno Coehoorn (d. March 1268) was a Nilfgaardian who served in the Imperial Army as Field marshal. He was in a position of confidence with the Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, and so was granted governorship over Cintra during his reign. He commanded the Center Army Group during the Second Northern War - his record included the several battles in Dol Angra, Aldersberg, Vengerberg and the Battle of Brenna, where he was killed.
History.
First Northern War.
In 1263, Coehoorn led the Nilfgaardian Army through the Marnadal Stairs of the Amell Mountains to a battle with the Cintran Army facing them at the mouth of the pass. They won the battle after the death of the Cintran king, Eist Tuirseach, and marched north to the capital of Cintra, where they sacked and slaughtered the entire city, resulting in Queen Calanthe committing suicide rather than be captured by Coehoorn.
They then marched further north into Upper Sodden, where a battle was fought and won against a Northern army. Coehoorn then took his army north across the Yaruga into Lower Sodden, and the battle of Sodden Hill was fought, a disastrous defeat for the army and Coehoorn, who ordered a southern retreat, marching back into and occupying the lands of Upper Sodden and Cintra, ending the First Northern War. Coehoorn remained in Cintra to govern in Emhyr's stead.
Interwar Period.
In 1267, after the war, Coehoorn met with Emhyr in Cintra. His spies gave him reliable information for the emperor; Demavend III had summoned the leaders of the Northern Kingdoms, Meve, Foltest, Vizimir II and Henselt, to Hagge in secret. After also reporting no word from Rience, Emhyr ordered him to deal with the recent rebellion, then straight to Dol Angra and lead there, as he needed solid leadership in the valley. As the marshal went to leave, a messenger entered the room and revealed the rebellion had been suppressed and the leader, Windhalm of Attre, arrested. The emperor tasked Coehoorn to be present at the rebel's execution in Cintra as governor of the city, much to the marshal's embarrassment, and then both were inturrupted by the knight Cahir, who was there for the emperor's orders. Emhyr then explained to them to arrange communication to Redania, and order Rience to kill Geralt of Rivia, before finally explaining his early plans for what became known as the Thanedd coup.
Second Northern War.
In June, Emhyr var Emreis heard news of the Aedirnians and Lyrians stationed in Dol Angra, awaiting orders to attack Glevitzingen, an Imperial border post, to set off the Second Northern War. The White Flame mustered an army, led by Coehoorn, in the region in secret, ready to counterattack at a moment's notice. During the night of July 1st, Nilfgaardian forces disguised as Lyrians and Aedirnians seized Glevitzingen. Mere moments after, a group of King Demavend III's heralds escorted by Lyrian soldiers – all of whom were quite possibly still disguised Black Ones – informed the folk of the surrounding villages that Aedirn was taking control now. Claiming this an act of aggression, Coehoorn led the Imperials across the Yaruga immediately, conquering the Lyrian border fortresses Scala and Spalla in just three days. Rivia was prepared for months of siege but capitulated under the promise of no harm.
Following Rivia's capture, Coehoorn appointed Duke Ardal aep Dahy to govern the city, leaving a considerable force to hold the capital.
From Rivia he marched north, almost without encountering resistance, as the armies of Demavend and Meve withdrew, unable to form a front in the deciding battle. The Nilfgaardians reached Aldersberg, and so Demavend and Meve decided to join battle, though their numbers proved too light, and the fortress was capitulated. Next Coehoorn besieged and sacked Vengerberg over a week's span, slaughtering nearly all 6,000 residents. Finally they march north to Lormark, where on a bridge on the river Dyfne, Coehoorn shook hands with Margrave Mansfeld of Ard Carraigh, signalising Kaedwen's newfound neutrality to Aedirn's capitulation.
In March 1268, Coehoorn met his defeat at the Battle of Brenna. The reconnaissance units commanded by Lamarr Flaut he sent out before the battle failed to notice the Nordling reserves under voivodes Bronibor and Blenckert. These units tipped the scales in favor of the Nordlings and Coehoorn was forced to flee. During his retreat, Commander Sievers offered to trade cloaks with him, allowing Coehoorn to escape in disguise while Sievers would attempt to distract the pursuing forces. Coehoorn accepted the offer, and escaped on horseback, but his progress was halted by the River Chotla, where he sustained an injury after he was thrown from his mount and kicked in the side of the face by a horse struggling to escape the marshy river. The remnants of Zoltan Chivay's company caught up to him at the edge of the river, where Coehoorn attempted to surrender. However, the dwarves couldn't understand his speech through his wounded jaw, and, due to the embroidery on Sievers' cloak, mistook him for a member of the 7th Daerlanian Brigade, shooting him with their crossbows, crying vengeance "for Caleb Stratton". Coehoorn was hit by three bolts, and drowned in the waters of the Chotla.
Legacy.
His body though was never recovered or recognized, and thus nobody knew how he died, or if he had even died on the battlefield. Some believed he had fled, fearing the imperial wrath and that he hid in Brokilon as a hermit. Others said that he hanged himself and that his spirit wandered the battlefield of Brenna saying continuously "Give me back my legions".
After his death, Havart var Moehoen took the rank of Field marshal.

Clay Pits is a quest given to Geralt by Vaska, the eldress of the Brickmakers' village in the Swamp in Chapter II.
Walkthrough.
On his way through the Swamp forest, Geralt comes upon a small hamlet, the Brickmakers' village. Curious, he begins speaking with the local inhabitants to try to learn more about the place. There seem to be quite a few of them milling about. Most of them do not have much to say, but an old woman, Vaska, the eldress of the village is more chatty.
She tells the witcher that the livelihood of the village is threatened by drowners who have infested the area around the clay pits, the brickmakers' primary worksite. As long as the necrophages lurk by the ovens, the villagers can not work. She then asks the witcher what "he" does and upon learning that he deals with monsters for a living, she asks him to deal with these monsters and offers 50 as a reward. Geralt is feeling generous that day, so he agrees.
Our hero then sets off for the clay pits in search of the pesky critters, after all, a little albedo-laced aether never goes amiss. He finds them, and quite a few of them, hiding between the sheds and pits. It really does not take much time or effort to clear the area - not for an experienced witcher. Then it is back to the village.
Vaska is pleased and grateful for the help, but confesses that she lied earlier when she offered the reward. She does not have 50 , but she does not want Geralt to leave empty-handed either so she gives him an amulet, the Kezath sephirah instead.
After sometime this quest is completed, Brickmakers will inhabit the Clay Pits and continue their work again.
Phases.
Drowners.
Vaska claims that the brickmakers have problems with the drowners. She's offering 50 orens for solving this problem. It is not much but every penny is useful. I must go to the clay pits and kill all drowners I find there. "I must go to the clay pits and kill all drowners I find there."
More Drowners.
I cleansed the first pit. I'm halfway through the job, so to speak. I must kill all drowners before I return to Vaska. "I must kill all drowners before I return to Vaska."
Success.
I cleansed the remaining pits - I think that's all. I must return to Vaska and tell her the clay pits are safe now. "I must return to Vaska and tell her the clay pits are safe now." (500 XP)
Payment.
Vaska failed to pay me 50 orens as agreed. Instead, she gave me a magic stone called a Sephirah. "I completed the task, but instead of the promised reward I received a magic Sephirah." ( + 2000 XP)

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;The Cannibal is an optional quest in Chapter II which begins when Geralt finds half-eaten human remains in a hut in the Swamp.
Walkthrough.
The only way Geralt can obtain this quest is by visiting Gramps' hut. Gramps can be there when he does, but Geralt must audibly acknowledge the human remains before talking to Gramps to receive the quest. As he does, he will notice half-eaten human remains, evidently "dinner" leftovers and remark that a cannibal must live there.
If Geralt discovers this before speaking to Gramps about his pilgrimage to the Shrine of Melitele, that quest is no longer an option during that conversation. To do both quests, Geralt should accompany Gramps to the shrine before going to his hut as the trigger is when Geralt looks around and sees gnawed bones.
Both quests are optional, but they also provide some useful opportunities for experience and loot.
If you decide to kill Gramps, after meeting him in his hut, he will run outside. Once you go outside too Gramps will have backup in the form of a circle of 5 Echinops and a unique Archespore in the middle (has Gramps been growing them?), so be prepared for a tough fight. If you are low level then best idea is to stay hidden behind the hut and wait for Gramps to come to you, then kill him and next kill off the weeds one at a time using Igni and running back behind the hut. While there is no specific oil that works against Echinops or Archespore's Argentia will increase your damage against them. Also if you have not yet killed the Coccacidium then it will most certainly join in too, so it's best to kill it before starting this quest.
Phases.
Maneater.
A cannibal lives in a hut on the island. I must find him. "I have to find the cannibal that lives in a hut in the swamps."
It turns out that Gramps, whom I took to the Melitele chapel, is a cannibal... "I wonder what I should do with Gramps the cannibal..." (500 XP)
It turns out that Gramps is a cannibal. I found chewed human bones in his house. "It turns out that Gramps is a cannibal." (500 XP)
Spare Gramps: The old man is a cannibal but I decided to let him live. "Seems Gramps is a cannibal."
Chat first, then kill Gramps: The old man is a cannibal. I will make sure he doesn't eat anyone else. "I decided to kill Gramps the cannibal."
Spare Gramps: Gramps shared his knowledge with me, proving again that he's useful. "Gramps shared his knowledge with me." (Azoth + Formula for Hanged Man's Venom + 1000 XP)
Kill Gramps: Another beast is dead. "Another beast is dead." (2000 XP)

Summary.
The empire of Nilfgaard attacks the kingdom of Cintra. Queen Calanthe commits suicide and her granddaughter, Cirilla, called Ciri and nicknamed the "Lion Cub of Cintra" manages to flee from the burning capital city. Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard, sends his spies to find her. He knows that this young girl has great importance, not only because of her royal blood, but also because of her magical potential and elven blood in her veins.
The girl is being protected by Geralt of Rivia, a witcher - a magically and genetically mutated monster slayer for hire, who takes her to the witchers' keep - Kaer Morhen. There, Ciri is being taught by the other witchers, including old Vesemir, Coën, Eskel and Lambert. She learns about monsters and how to fight them. She is taught to fight with a sword in the witcher style. But during her "education", the sorceress Triss Merigold comes to Kaer Morhen. She is called by Geralt to help with occasional strange and abnormal behavior he has seen in Ciri. Triss realizes that Ciri is a Source. She acknowledges that she does not have the power to control Ciri's talent, and advises Geralt to swallow his pride and seek help with Yennefer, a more experienced sorceress and his former lover.
At the same time, a mysterious wizard called Rience is looking for the girl. He is a servant of a more powerful mage, who remains unknown. He captures Geralt's friend, Dandelion the bard, and tortures him for information about Ciri. Dandelion is saved by the timely arrival of Yennefer, who engages in a short magic combat with Rience. Rience manages to escape through a portal opened by his master, but left with a prominent facial scar from Yennefer's spell.
In the spring, Geralt leaves Kaer Morhen with Triss and Ciri, intending to deliver Ciri to the Temple School in Ellander where she would receive a "normal" education from Nenneke. On the way, Triss falls ill, and they join Yarpen Zigrin's dwarven company who is guarding a caravan for King Henselt. Geralt tells Ciri about the roses of Aelirenn, an elf who died leading the elven youths to fight the humans. The caravan is attacked by the Scoia'tael, and it is revealed that the escort mission was a trap set by the kings who doubted Yarpen's loyalty.
Meanwhile, in Hagge Castle in the Pontar Valley, Vizimir II, Demavend, Henselt, Foltest, and Meve meet in secret to discuss the Nilfgaard army who are camped on the bank of the Yaruga river. It is concluded that Ciri must be found and killed "for matters of State" and none of the others in the room speak out against this; resolving to instead remain silent in agreement.
A while later, Menno Coehoorn informs Emhyr of this secret meeting of kings in Hagge castle. Amongst other things, Emhyr tells the governor to inform the Chapter of this meeting and that orders are to be sent to Rience to have him quietly assassinate Geralt, hide, and wait for further instructions. However, he was explicitly not to harm Yennefer.
Later at Ellander, Ciri thinks she is dreaming, but sees Geralt and his party on their way to find Rience but wakes to hear Nenneke scolding Yennefer for the way she interacts with Ciri. Her stay is still haunted by disturbing dreams until the arrival of Yennefer, who starts educating her in the ways of magic. From an initial antagonism, their relationship develops into a strong and deep bond, like that of a mother and daughter.
Meanwhile, Geralt does his best to track Rience and his mysterious employer. With the help of Dandelion and Shani, he forces a confrontation with Rience, during which both are injured. Rience's master intervenes again, opening a portal for him, and Geralt is prevented from pursuing the mage by Philippa Eilhart, who also kills the last surviving of the Michelet brothers so as not to provide Geralt any source of information which might eventually reveal the mysterious mage. Eilhart then leaves behind a wounded Geralt.
Yennefer became Ciri's mentor and teacher. As they are about to leave the Temple School in Ellander, Yennefer asks Ciri whether she didn't like her at first, leading to a series of flashbacks detailing Ciri's studies with Yennefer from the day they were introduced and back to the present as they are about to leave the Temple. And Ciri responds by admitting the she didn't like her at first, but it quickly changed, they both bonded together, afterwards they leave.

Sword of Destiny (Polish: "Miecz przeznaczenia)" is the second book in Andrzej Sapkowski's "The Witcher" series in terms of story chronology, although the original Polish edition was published in 1992, before "The Last Wish" (but after the "Wiedźmin" short story collection made obsolete by "The Last Wish"). One of the individual short stories was first published in "Fantastyka" magazine.
Both English publishers decided to skip "Sword of Destiny" and publish "Blood of Elves" (the first novel in the saga) directly after "The Last Wish", even though the short stories in this collection take place earlier and introduce some of the characters that become major characters in the novels.
The UK edition was subsequently published by Gollancz on 21 May 2015 and the U.S. edition was released by Orbit on 1 December 2015. Gollancz later released a second edition on 10 March 2016.
Audio Versions.
There are two audio versions available in Polish. Classic audiobook, lasting about 13 hours and read by Roch Siemianowski, was released by superNOWA (Polish publisher of Sapkowski's works) in 1990s.
In 2011, after huge success of audio play based on Sapkowski's "Narrenturm", Fonopolis and audioteka.pl released audio plays based on "The Last Wish" and "Sword of Destiny". The latter, lasting about 15 hours, was voiced by 49 actors, including Krzysztof Banaszyk (Vernon Roche in "Assassins of Kings") as Geralt, Anna Dereszowska as Yennefer, Sławimir Pacek (minor characters in video games) as Dandelion, Joanna Pach (minor characters in video games) as Ciri, Wiktor Zborowski (famous Polish actor) as Istredd and Krzysztof Gosztyła as narrator. Samples from all short stories can be found on audioteka.pl's site.

The Dogcatcher of Vizima is a contract quest in "The Witcher".
The Dog Contract
"I will pay for the elimination of stray dogs. Deliver six pots of dog tallow as proof of completing the task."
"Gravedigger - find me at the cemetery gate."
Walkthrough.
To cull the burgeoning local population of stray dogs, the gravedigger has offered a reward to anyone who can produce six jars of dog lard as proof of killing the pesky mutts. What is a cash-poor witcher to do?
The kindest way to get the dog tallow is to search containers and Salamandra remains for it because, in the course of the game no dogs attack you. If you just can not be patient, at night, because locations are considered "dangerous", you can draw your weapon. Good-bye little puppies.
If you do not believe in killing innocent canines, there are some alternatives. Searching for containers of it does work. You will find them in many places, if not always reliably. Also, at night sometimes you will be attacked, either by fleders or by roving Salamandra thugs. If the fleders or Salamandra are near dogs, they usually get killed (try to lure them towards any nearby dogs as you fight. They might get whacked, then "you" did not kill them, right? However, such an action can be considered devious.
Phases.
Dog Tallow.
The gravedigger wants to exterminate all of Vizima's stray dogs. He'll pay for six pots of dog tallow. "I need to collect six pots of dog tallow for the gravedigger."
Loot.
I have six pots of dog tallow. I should see the gravedigger. "I should see the gravedigger and claim my reward." (500 XP)
Payment.
The gravedigger paid me for the dog tallow, but dog catching is not my idea of a pleasant pursuit. "I received my reward for the dog tallow." (100 + 2000 XP)

Notes.
This quest was never fully implemented in the game. One anonymous user posted that they had gotten the quest, but provided no proof whatsoever, nor any additional information.
Phases.
Royal Edicts.
I promised Radovid that I would get the royal edicts. Another thing is whether I should really give them to him? Edicts are located in the army warehouse at the main square in the Trade Quarter.
Betrayal.
The contact betrayed us! The army and Salamanders attacked us! I must recover the edicts, they're somewhere inside the building!
Edicts.
I killed the traitor. Time to look for the edicts - they're somewhere in the building. (1000 XP)
A Traitor's Daughter.
I promised the traitor I would save his daughter. She's in the other part of the warehouse - I can get there via the upper floor.
The Search.
I saved the girl, but I was foolish to think somebody would reward me. The edicts are somewhere in the building. (2000 XP)
The Decision.
I have the royal edicts. Time to analyze them. Can I trust Radovid? Maybe I should show them to somebody else. Triss, perhaps?
Forgery.
Radovid has evidence that the royal edicts have been forged. He's considering whether to notify Foltest.
Forgery.
Triss noticed that the royal edicts are signed. That makes Thaler a liar. Triss wants to make sure by sending them out to be examined, but this will take time.

Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253, and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday. She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.
After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt invoked the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny.
Biography.
Ciri was born in Skellige in Belleteyn of the following year and initially, Calanthe ordered her advisor Mousesack to kill Geralt, wishing to break free from the Law of Surprise. Mousesack was ready to go, as nobody refused the queen, but when he was summoned a short time later Calanthe retracted the order without explanation.
Growing up, not much is known about Ciri's relationship with her parents, though it appeared Pavetta adored her daughter, with others remarking how it was rare for her to be parted from Ciri. However, this didn't stop Pavetta from secretly sending Ciri ashore just as the small family was set to sail out from Skellige to Cintra, against Calanthe's wishes, who wished for them all to stay. Shortly after, Pavetta and Duny died at sea around the Sedna Abyss, making Ciri an orphan before she was 5 years old. Angry at her nephew-in-law, Crach an Craite, for letting them sail out, Calanthe then had Crach swear a blood oath that he'd always protect Ciri before deciding to forbid Ciri from visiting the isles again. However, this ban only lasted 6 months before Calanthe let Ciri visit Skellige once more every summer and winter.
Cintra's Princess.
With the death of her mother, Ciri was now the only remaining heir to Cintra and thus Calanthe took special care to raise her granddaughter. Despite Calanthe's attempts to keep Ciri shielded from learning about being a Child of Surprise and that she was destined to be a witcher since birth, Ciri's nanny told the young girl all about a white-haired witcher, and that he'd one day come for her to be taken away to be trained as one as well. When Calanthe found out she was furious but by then the seeds had been sown and Ciri began to firmly believe that was her destiny.
Then, 6 years almost to the day when Duny's curse was lifted, Geralt returned to Cintra but Calanthe, not wishing to lose her only remaining descendant, hid Ciri amongst a group of boys and had them playing around in the moat outside the castle when Geralt dropped in, who erroneously believed Pavetta had a son and wondered which one "he" was in the group. Despite this, he refused to take any child with him and left without even learning the true identity of Pavetta's child.
Entering Brokilon.
Shortly after, Calanthe arranged an engagement between Ciri and Windhalm of Attre, a now 20 year old who once vied for Pavetta's hand 7 years prior. However, Calanthe had a change in heart and called off the engagement years later before setting up another one, this time to Kistrin, the sole prince of Verden. However, the now 10 year old Ciri wasn't fond of this idea or of Kistrin and, no sooner had she arrived in Verden in 1263 to meet her suitor and his family, did she escape with aid from a teenage squire. This plan went awry when they mistakenly ended up in the dreaded Brokilon region, a forest off-limits to anyone not friends with the dryads that lived there. While normally the dryads shot to kill on sight, Ciri wasn't noticed by them, though the squire and the search party following them weren't so lucky and were killed.
While she wandered alone deeper into the dangerous forest, she was spotted by a giant centipede and almost met her death there when her screams were heard by Geralt and Braenn who were coincidentally nearby. After they killed the giant centipede though, Ciri tried to take off but immediately stopped when Braenn nearly hit her with an arrow. Despite this, the young princess refused to answer them and went as far as stating she'd have both of them beheaded before eventually joining them in their trek to Duén Canell, all the while telling Geralt how she didn't want a husband and threatening to bite Geralt to get him to answer her questions before the witcher threatened to whip her with his belt, making her behave politely the rest of the trip.
When the group arrived in Duén Canell, Ciri met the injured Freixenet, who also wished to beat the young princess for running away, before the governor revealed that Geralt was a witcher. Before Ciri could ask further on this, Braenn started to lead the princess away and Ciri realized they were preparing to make her a dryad and began to cry, though allowed herself to be led away.
A few hours later, Ciri sat with the dryad queen, Eithné, in her home. As Geralt arrived to discuss his reason for being sent to Brokilon, it eventually turned to Ciri, who was to be made a dryad. However, Ciri had already told Eithné something she hadn't revealed to Geralt yet: that she was destined to be a witcher and on learning who Geralt was, she realized she was destined to him. As Geralt made to leave rather than watch the young girl drink the Water of Brokilon that'd erase all her previous memories, Ciri begged him to stay and so he did for her sake. As he watched though, Ciri didn't show any of the normal signs after drinking the water and when the dryad queen asked the young girl who she wanted to go with, she revealed she still wished to go with Geralt, and thus the queen allowed the two to leave.
Geralt, now realizing Ciri was his Child of Surprise, traveled with her out of the forest, though when he took off east to Brugge Ciri appeared uncomfortable, remarking she felt they were going the wrong way, but followed anyways. A short time later it appeared she was correct: they ran into a group of King Ervyll's soldiers who were staging a merchant robbery as an act by the dryads. Not aware of the situation, Ciri suddenly remarked the dryads couldn't have done it as the tree was cut down, causing the men to try and kill her and Geralt, but Geralt held them off as he demanded she run. Instead of running far though, Ciri instead took an earlier story Geralt told to heart and climbed all the way up a tree. After the mercenaries were killed off by Geralt, nearby dryads, and the arrival of Mousesack, Ciri rejoined them, though the druid remarked Calanthe would probably be ready to spank the girl despite being sent by Calanthe to call off Ciri and Kistrin's engagement.
That night though, Geralt tried to take off once more without Ciri, who awoke after he rode off and yelled after him not to go and that she was his destiny. However, Geralt didn't turn around, leaving Mousesack to take her back to Cintra.
Adventures in Skellige.
Shortly after Ciri traveled back to Skellige and at one point became extremely infatuated with one of the kingdom's famous warriors, Olaf Stigvason. However, this love was never meant to be as he was 35 years old, married, and with children older than Ciri. Distraught at this, Ciri decided she'd commit suicide by drowning and waited for favorable weather conditions to do so. This took too long though and during the wait, she was able to overcome her infatuation with the warrior.
Sometime later that season, she saw some of the boys, including a 15 year old Hjalmar an Craite, playing a game on the ice where they'd try to see how many rocks in a row they could jump over while skating. Hjalmar held the current record until Ciri, extremely agile and fast, beat it. Not to be outdone, Hjalmar tried to beat Ciri's record but smashed into the ice instead, breaking several bones in the process. Despite this, Hjalmar held no grudges against Ciri and the young girl regularly visited him while he healed. Being young and naïve, the two soon got "engaged" but as soon as Crach heard of this he promptly broke them up as Calanthe had other plans in the works to marry Ciri off and the young girl was dragged back home to Cintra by her grandmother.
Shortly after, Calanthe arranged Ciri's third official engagement: this time to the 9 year old Radovid V of Redania. Before the children ever had a chance to meet though, Radovid's father, Vizimir II, called off the engagement 6 months later.
Fall of Cintra.
In 1263, the Nilfgaardian Empire, which had been taking over kingdoms in the south for some time, eventually decided to move on Cintra. During the final push, Ciri found herself barricaded in the capital's castle with her grandmother and many of the nobles, with no chance of surviving as it was only a matter of time when the Nilfgaardian soldiers would break in. Unknown to her and her grandmother, there was also a Nilfgaardian spy in the castle and so when Calanthe had some of her soldiers try to flee with the young Ciri, the spy signaled to the invaders that she was escaping.
Ciri's escorts ran into Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach's group and a chase through the burning city unfolded before Cahir's men eventually caught up with the Cintran guards and a fight ensued. As both Nilfgaardians and Cintrans alike died, a frightened Ciri was dropped to the ground and barely escaped from being stabbed herself. Still in a daze, Ciri soon found herself alone with Cahir, the only other survivor out of the fight and distinguished by his winged helmet. As he picked up Ciri, she began to scream before fainting. A short time later she came to as Cahir had managed to escape the city with her, but with Cahir not knowing her language, nothing helped ease her mind. Later that night, when the two went to sleep, she managed to slip away from him.
Now alone, Ciri ended up wandering the forests of Riverdell for two weeks, staying with a family of four in Kagen who taught her to spin yarn, before finding a group of fugitives and staying with them for a month before she was eventually taken in by druids, as they tended to take in homeless children as a result of the war. A short time later, Goldencheeks took her in and so Ciri moved in with the woman and her family in Lower Sodden. While Ciri didn't reveal who she was and where she was from, Goldencheeks took a liking to the girl over the next six months, especially as she herself couldn't bear anymore children and only had sons. As fate would have it though, Goldencheeks' husband, Yurga, was out on a trip during this time and was rescued by Geralt, who didn't know what else to ask for as a reward and so enacted the Law of Surprise. When Yurga brought the witcher back to his place in 1264 and learned of the unexpected girl his wife had taken in, Ciri suddenly spotted Geralt and cried out to him before the two ran to each other, reuniting once more.
Training at Kaer Morhen.
In 1265, with Geralt now accepting Ciri as his destiny, he took the young girl with him to Kaer Morhen, both to keep her in hiding and to train her to be a witcher. During the trip there, Ciri was often plagued by nightmares of the knight with the winged helmet and Geralt had to reassure her everything was ok while holding her close until she fell asleep. When they finally arrived that autumn, the princess was initially afraid of the witchers but as soon as Geralt confirmed she was their destiny she began to see the small group as family and friends. That same night that they arrived though, the witchers quickly learned Ciri was no ordinary child. Thirsty, Ciri grabbed the nearest drink off the table, and before the witchers could stop her, she accidentally drank White Seagull which, combined with her Elder Blood, sent Ciri into a trance, speaking in another voice but incoherently.
A bit uneasy by this but not able to do anything else, the witchers, including Geralt, Vesemir, Lambert, Eskel, and Coën, began to train Ciri as a witcher. They used special mushrooms and herbs found in the valley to accelerate both her physical and hormonal progression as a witcher, allowing her much more strength and agility for her size. However, during one training episode she fell and once more went into an incomprehensible trance. It was only the third one, during one of her many nightmares, that she began to speak coherently, prophesying Coën's and Geralt's deaths. However like all the previous ones, Ciri never remembered them nor what she said so the witchers never told her about the episodes.
Regardless, the witchers needed help understanding what was happening to Ciri and so in 1265 they sent for the sorceress Triss Merigold, as Geralt didn't wish to involve Yennefer due to how they last split up. By December, Triss arrived in time to see a now 12 year old Ciri running the Trail, an obstacle course around the keep, but as Ciri made to jump the Gullet portion, she landed wrong and Triss ran over. While initially scared of the unknown woman, Ciri eventually let the sorceress heal her wound before the two made their way to the keep. As they did so, Triss witnessed firsthand one of Ciri's trances, this time predicting Triss' death, before Ciri woke up, believing she'd fallen asleep.
The next day, Triss went with Ciri to her room to inspect the young girl while fixing up her clothes, which had been haphazardly put together by Vesemir. As they talked, Ciri eventually confided she was scared of some of the training equipment before revealing something she'd been too embarrassed to bring up to the men: her menstruation had begun and, with no other women around, had no idea what was going on. With Triss' guidance, Ciri went and informed the witchers that she was "indisposed" and wouldn't be doing any physical training until it'd passed. Then, following Triss' earlier instructions, asked for Triss to be allowed to stay, before excusing herself. With that, Triss set forth a condition that the witchers stop feeding Ciri their special herbs and mushrooms as, while they helped with fitness and building muscle, they could have adverse effects on Ciri's womanly attributes as she grew up.
On Midwinter night, as Coën kept Ciri distracted with a game, Triss revealed Ciri was a Source, leading to initial denial as the witchers pointed out Ciri couldn't even do basic signs. However, Triss revealed that Sources were only transmitters of magic and therefore had no actual control over it: if they tried to force it nothing came out, but a strong emotion could unexpectedly flatten half a town. After the witchers revealed to Triss Ciri's past trances, Coën came through with Ciri and Triss gave the young girl White Seagull to send her into a trance once more, with the aim to find out what was speaking through her. Triss soon learned though that whatever was speaking through Ciri was extremely powerful, too powerful for Triss to control and stop it if it ever burst through Ciri. Naturally, Ciri didn't remember any of it and, despite not knowing enough Elder Speech to make sentences, as she was coming out of the trance she spoke in the tongue to say "something is ending." Knowing they needed help from a more experienced mage, Geralt finally relented in asking for Yennefer's help come spring, as they planned to take Ciri to Ellander's Temple of Melitele for schooling.
As the winter went on, Ciri continued her witcher training while also taking Elder Speech lessons from Triss, the latter of whom kept an eye on the girl every day and night to make sure whatever spoke through Ciri didn't come back, while also soothing her back to sleep when she woke up from nightmares. At one point the witchers even made a custom sword for Ciri to match her build.
One night in the middle of February 1266 though, Ciri slipped down and eavesdropped on a conversation Triss was having with the witchers in regards to their indifference to politics and went into detail about what happened during the Battle of Sodden Hill. As Ciri ran in, proclaiming she'd stand by Triss in fighting the Nilfgaardians as they'd killed her grandmother, Ciri revealed she thought she was training to kill, as she wanted to kill the winged helmet knight that haunted her dreams. Geralt sharply chastised her, informing her they were training her to save lives, not to kill out of fear and hatred, before sending her out of the room.
Distraught, Ciri ran out into the courtyard and stopped on the ledge of one of the walls where she inspected her sword. As Geralt and Triss approached, she cried out that nobody was going to take her sword from her, but as she moved, she lost her footing and almost fell to her death but Geralt caught her in the nick of time. After speaking comforting words to Ciri, the three agreed it was time to head south to the temple in Ellander.
Traveling to Ellander.
As the trio made their way through Kaedwen, Triss suddenly fell ill from food poisoning, preventing them from being able to ride for very long as they had to keep making stops for her. At one point they reached an outpost that was overflowing with merchants and soldiers and, despite Geralt sending Ciri to look after Triss, the girl showed back up in time to overhear one of the commandants vehemently proclaiming all nonhumans were in cahoots with the Scoia'tael and Nilfgaard had been backing them. Before more could be said, the trio were asked to leave as, despite Triss not being contagious, the soldiers didn't want to take the chance. One of the soldiers though pointed them in the direction of a convoy that was headed in the same general direction and who might be able to better assist Triss.
Within a day, they'd caught up with the convoy who were made up of old dwarven acquaintances of Geralt's and were now following King Henselt's orders to deliver a special order. As they traveled with Yarpen Zigrin and his group, Ciri eavesdropped a few times on their conversations, particularly when Scoia'tael were mentioned, as Yarpen was adamantly against them, despite being nonhuman himself.
At one point, when Geralt headed to the back of the convoy, Ciri sat up front with Yarpen and, after being shown how to steer the wagon, asked Yarpen about his earlier conversation with Geralt, namely what he meant by the witcher being indifferent before she figured out that Yarpen was between a rock and hard place: being nonhuman he wasn't accepted by humans but by helping a human king, he was a traitor in the Scoia'tael eyes.
As the trip continued, she and Geralt both took care of the still ailing, but now recovering, Triss. However, Ciri became annoyed when the other dwarves wrongly assumed that Triss and Geralt were a couple, and was further annoyed with Triss when the sorceress appeared to try and snuggle up rather too much to Geralt when they helped bathe her. After being asked by Geralt to leave during one such episode, Ciri bumped into Yarpen and asked who was right in the fight between the Scoia'tael and humans. After a while, Yarpen finally noted that he'd like to live in a way where he didn't have to ask for forgiveness and everyone would learn to live next to each other. With that, Ciri remarked how Yarpen wasn't all that different from her.
The next day, Geralt let Ciri ride a bit ahead of the convoy but, being anxious just to run off for a short while, she galloped way ahead of the convoy to take in the silence and surroundings and soon made her way a bit off the main road. As she enjoyed the forest area she began to think how she'd never be indifferent, that she intended to save defenseless people from evil, like the horrors she saw during the war, and couldn't understand why Geralt and the other witchers were neutral about it.
While thinking this over, she suddenly ducked down beneath a bush and none too soon as, across the clearing, a large band of Scoia'tael appeared and began to move through the area. When they were finally gone and she felt safe, Ciri popped back up only for Geralt to grab her to keep her from screaming in surprise. As Geralt instructed her back to the horses, he told her not to say a word of what she saw to the others and and that the trio would depart from the convoy tomorrow. Infuriated and not understanding his indifference in this, Ciri questioned Geralt about it, who calmly told her the Scoia'tael group wasn't there for the convoy, but something else. He then led her to Shaerrawedd, an ancient elven palace now in ruins. However, in the center of the ruins still remained a statue of Aelirenn, an elf that'd tried to lead one last desperate battle against humans 200 years ago. While the elders didn't wish to, feeling they could wait out humanity with their long lifespans, Aelirenn was able to rally most of the younger elves, and the only ones able to still have offspring. The fight ended in a massacre and thus doomed the elven race to annihilation.
Finally understanding that witcher neutrality wasn't about being insensitive but rather to prevent more unnecessary massacres, Ciri then asked to take one of the special roses to remember. As she did though, she pricked herself and suddenly realized the rest of the convoy was under attack and the two galloped back to get to Triss.
As the two arrived, the convoy was indeed under attack by Scoia'tael and, ignoring Geralt's orders to head into the woods, Ciri hurried to Triss and pulled her into cover while the fighting continued all around them. While initially protected by the others around her, soon Ciri found herself alone, face to face with an elf, and now without her sword. As the elf moved in though, she spotted Shaerrawedd's rose on Ciri, causing enough hesitation for Geralt to come from behind and kill the elf before Ciri passed out. When she came to, the group had been rescued by Dun Banner, another Kaedwenian military unit, but soon learned the whole convoy had been a trap: wanting to test Yarpen's loyalty, they were actually given common stone to transport while another tipped off the Scoia'tael about the "special" convoy so they'd attack it. As Geralt and Ciri looked on at the fallen acquaintances and Scoia'tael members, Geralt threw the now blood stained rose onto the elf he'd killed earlier to protect Ciri, with Ciri saying goodbye as Geralt asked for forgiveness.
Training with Yennefer.
After the chaos with the convoy, the three had a far more peaceful trip to the Temple of Melitele and once there, Geralt left Ciri in Nenneke's care, while he wrote to Yennefer about the situation and asked for her help in teaching Ciri.
While Yennefer made her way to the temple, Ciri was treated like any other pupil, sleeping in a dormitory with the other students, while learning about history, nature, poetry, prose, runes, the Elder Speech, and doing chores. When she could, she'd also write to Geralt to tell him about the goings-on.
After Yennefer arrived, Ciri at first openly didn't like her as the sorceress was quite cold, though they quickly started to develop a mother-daughter bond, and she spent more and more time with the sorceress, doing chores only two days a week, and seeing her friends rarely. Yennefer pushed the girl putting her through many tests, and taught her about muscles and bones, about balance and how to control one's breathing. She also taught Ciri about magic and Chaos and how to control it. One night, after being worn out from several days of intense training with Yennefer, she had a dream about Geralt, Shani and Dandelion, awaking to Yennefer arguing with Nenneke about the sorceress' training methods, and so forced herself back to sleep. Some time later, while doing chores with her new friends Iola the Second and Eurneid, she was told about the rising political tension and the possibility of a second northern war, which made her curious so she went and saw Jarre, Nenneke's ward. He told her of the geography of the area, and the potential of the second war, which he believed was unlikely. After Jarre's awkward flirting started to make Ciri irritated, she ran to Yennefer who told her they were to leave the following morning, for solitude at the magic school of Aretuza.
Journey to Aretuza.
In late June 1267, after a night at an inn in Ellander, Ciri and Yennefer were preparing to leave when Ciri entered a trance and foretold the messenger Aplegatt of his death on hot sands. The following night was spent at an inn in the Temerian town of Anchor. After three days more ride, they arrived in Gors Velen, where Yennefer hid Ciri's identity so they could visit Giancardi Bank, where Molnar Giancardi told them of the politics of the continent and paid for Ciri's tuition in Ellander, and her future tuition at Aretuza. Molnar then summoned Fabio Sachs, his apprentice who could take Ciri on a tour of the city. They saw the fish market and then Fabio showed her Thanedd Island from the city walls. Finally they went to the marketplace, where many great wonders amazed the girl, such as camels. After listening to a priest preach about the Aretuza mages, the holy man proceeded to grope Ciri, who screamed at him in the square, only calmed by Fabio taking her for food. As Fabio went to get his fortune told, Ciri lapsed into another trance and foretold his life as an explorer and death in an unnamed continent. While continuing to look through the market, the two came across a man advertising his "basilisk" from Zerrikania, which intrigued Ciri, so they went in. The basilisk ended up being a wyvern, which Ciri kept mentioning to the man, to the point of him of challenging her to survive the creature's venom as a test. She freely walked up and proved the man wrong, though as she walked back the wyvern broke out of its small cage, attacking its owner. Ciri, using her training from Kaer Morhen, made quick work of the creature, and luckily protecting her identity, the crowd thought it was the work of a young squire standing nearby. Angry at her for "angering the beast", the crowd chased her away from the market, and she used the amulet given to her by Yennefer for disguisement, giving off magical interference that summoned Tissaia de Vries and Margarita Laux-Antille. They believed Ciri was an escaped student from Aretuza and so Tissaia put her under a paralysis spell and with Fabio's advice carried the girl to Giancardi Bank, where Yennefer confirmed her identity.
Tissaia apologised and invited them to The Silver Heron inn, where they all proceeded to spend several hours bathing. As the sorceresses started to get drunk, Ciri left the cellar and convinced the innkeeper to give her a horse, left a note for Yennefer, and rode west toward Geralt's last known location, Hirundum. Throughout the stormy trip she had flashbacks to Cintra and the black knight, to Shaerrawedd, and then even saw glimpses of the Wild Hunt attempting to recruit her. By the time she arrived at the farm and saw Geralt and then Yennefer, who followed her via portal, she was extremely exhausted and fainted. The following morning she snuck out of the Hofmeier house and eavesdropped on her two mentors talking, which was quickly caught onto by Dandelion, the bard friend of Geralt. Eventually things were summarized and Yennefer invited Ciri and the witcher to the Conclave of Mages on Thanedd.
Thanedd Coup.
After arriving on Thanedd on the last day of the month, and after the Aretuza evening ball, Ciri awoke in the early hours of the morning to the sounds of fighting; the Northern allied mages were arresting the others secretly allied with Nilfgaard. Yennefer guided the young girl through the palace, until they reached Philippa Eilhart and Ciri, in a trance, confirmed the truth behind the attack in Dol Angra, where Demavend had attempted to incite a war against Nilfgaard. However, as it'd been a technical attack against the Empire, Emhyr's troops answered back and began to push into Aedirn and Lyria. She then further revealed that King Vizimir II had been assassinated during the night. Following her recovery, a fight broke out in Garstang, and Yennefer and Ciri were forced to flee, only to be attacked by an elven assassin. Yennefer killed the elf and told Ciri to get down to Loxia, as she could find refuge their with Margarita Laux-Antille. Almost immediately after leaving the room, she was spotted by the mage Rience and two of his elven accomplances, and chased toward a high balcony where, using her nimbleness and bravery, she was able to escape their clutches. She was grabbed by Artaud Terranova, but she was rescued by Geralt and Philippa. Geralt got Ciri on her horse and set her out while he went to rescue Yennefer. Ciri was pursued by Cahir, but thanks to her training, she was able to defeat him in combat, but seeing him without his helm, seeing a normal man instead of a figure from her nightmares, she chose not to kill him, before fleeing. She entered Tor Lara and went through the portal in the tower, but because of it's unpredictable nature, it randomly sent Ciri to the Korath desert.
Unaware of where she was and without obvious recourse, the girl decided to make her way out of the wasteland by heading west. Unfortunately, she wandered around in circles for some time before deciding to use the stars as a guide. She nearly died of exhaustion, dehydration and starvation. Luckily for her, she met a unicorn whom she nicknamed Little Horse that helped her out of the desert. She used fire magic to heal her companion, and while other the unicorns, quietly observing her actions, were unpleased with her utilising its power, they decided not to kill her because she saved one of their own. Eventually Ciri fell unconscious due to pyromantic visions; the experience in tapping into such power and relinquishing it left her psychologically numb.
The Rats.
The next day, Sir Sweers and the Trappers found her and (after a short conflict with one of Sweers' sworn enemies, the House of Varnhagen) brought her to safety in Glyswen. Ciri, who was still undergoing an emotional tribulation, then helped the Rats, a group of ne'er-do-wells, to rescue their member Kayleigh. She named herself Falka after the woman she saw in the pyromantic visions. That night, Kayleigh wanted to "thank" Ciri by trying to force her to have sex with him, but he was stopped by Mistle who wanted Ciri for her own. Despite sexual assaults, Ciri stayed with the Rats and even developed a romantic relationship with Mistle, despite sometimes claiming she did no longer like what Mistle had done to her.
During their travels, the Rats attacked a convoy of Baron of Casadei's daughter. The baron hired a bounty hunter Leo Bonhart to capture her alive; however, Bonhart was already hired by Stefan Skellen who wanted her to be killed so that the monarchy could be overthrown.
Bonhart killed the Rats and cut off their heads after their deaths. The hunter neither killed Ciri, nor brought her to Baron Casadei, therefore not fullfilling both contracts. Instead he imprisoned her for some time, beating her, mistreating and forcing her to kill in the arena at Claremont, which belonged to his cousin Houvenaghel.
On Velen Ciri managed to escape with the help of Vattier's spy Neratin Ceka when Bonhart had taken her to the village of Unicorn on the eve of the equinox. He had gone here to meet with Skellen and Rience and possibly negotiate some terms to release Ciri. Bonhart then killed Neratin, and Skellen seriously wounded Ciri, disfiguring her with an orion as she fled the village on her mare, Kelpie.
Later, she was found, near death by Vysogota of Corvo, who hid and healed her at his hermitage in the Pereplut swamp. She stayed with Vysogota until shortly after Saovine when she set off to find the Swallow's Tower, believed to be a twin tower to Tor Lara, so that she could return to Thanedd. Together with Skellen and Rience, Bonhart tried to hunt her down on the order of Vilgefortz, but she managed to escape due to the intervention of the Wild Hunt which scared off Bonhart's horse. Ciri entered the tower and was teleported to the world of the Aen Elle elves.
The Aen Elle.
There she was greeted by Avallac'h, an Aen Saevherne. He explained to her that she had to 'pay the debt' referring to the perceived loss to the Aen Elle when Lara Dorren took Cregennan of Lod as her lover. The elves believed that the latter had 'stolen' Elder Blood from them by marrying Lara. To atone for that 'crime' Avallac'h wanted Ciri to beget a child with Auberon Muircetach, the king of the Aen Elle. That being the only way Avallac'h would let her return to her own world. On their way to Tir ná Lia, the Aen Elle capital, they met Eredin and his Dearg Ruadhri. Ciri was initially quite infatuated with him - he realized that and tried to use it to control her. They also came across a pack of unicorns which appeared to be at cold war with Aen Elle.
In Tir ná Lia Ciri finally met Auberon, who many times tries to conceive a child with her, however he could not - to him she was just a human, a being of no interest for an Aen Elle. Nevertheless, he was very proud and refused to admit it. Eredin suggested using a 'potion' which would improve Auberon's performance and allow him to conceive a child with Cirilla. He also told her the truth (probably to gain her trust) - that Avallac'h would never let her go. Knowing this, Ciri found help with the unicorns where she also met Little Horse/Ihuarraquax, by then fully grown. The unicorns explained that both Fox and Sparrowhawk had once possessed The Gate of the Worlds, a mystical power known only to those of the Elder Blood but they had lost it. Now they wanted these powers back and for that they needed Ciri. This could not be allowed, however, and the unicorns explained to Cirilla how she should escape.
That same day Ciri once again visited Auberon only to find that he had drunk the 'potion' given to him by Eredin. Unknown to Sparrowhawk it happened to be too strong and killed Auberon. That night Ciri attempted to escape Tir ná Lia and its barrier by using a boat and swimming with the river's current. She was stopped by Eredin who then revealed his true intentions, being the same as Avallac'h's. The two battled and Ciri proved victorious due to the elf's underestimation of her abilities - she wounded him and threw him into the river. Later on she mounted Kelpie and rode away from Tir ná Lia. She met Horsey, who was in fact named Ihuarraquax and offered his help (actually his being by Ciri's side was a part of her bargain with the other unicorns). They came across a huge pile of bones.
To her horror, Ciri realized that the skulls had human teeth making them a pile of human bones. Ihuarraquax explained that it had been a human world until the elves led by Fox and Sparrowhawk arrived and killed them all - this also would be the fate of other worlds, including Ciri's own, should Avallac'h and Eredin succeed in once again harnessing the power of time and space. Nevertheless, Ihuarraquax and Ciri realized that they were being chased.
Little Horse urged Ciri to jump to another world - the only way to escape. She, however, didn't know how. The unicorn became her guide and they jumped. This led to the manifestation of Ciri's strongest power, giving her the title of The Lady of the Worlds. That power allowed her to traverse space and time at will. Not being able to control it, however, Ciri had to journey through many different worlds to finally find her own. She traveled to Stygga Castle to give herself to Vilgefortz in exchange for Yennefer's freedom. However, when she arrives there, he refuses to release Yennefer and instead reveals his plan to impregnate her and use her placenta to gain access to the Elder Blood. She was saved by Geralt and his hansa and later the Impera Brigade under the command of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself; during the ensuing battle, Ciri encountered and battled Leo Bonhart, using her training from Kaer Morhen to outmaneuvre, then seriously injure the bounty hunter. Bonhart seemingly succeeded in convincing Ciri to spare his life, insisting she was too noble to kill a beaten, unarmed man but Ciri ultimately killed Bonhart in self-defence when he made a last attempt to attack her from behind. While Emhyr revealed to Geralt that he too had intended to impregnate Ciri, after sending Geralt and Yennefer away, he instead informed Ciri that he is her father and leaves Stygga Castle.
Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri then set out from Stygga Castle and travel; first, they visit Jealousy, where she visits the graves of the Rats. Yennefer then left for Vengerberg, and Geralt and Ciri traveled to Toussaint. As they arrived, they found Dandelion, about to be executed for angering Anna Henrietta by falling in love with another woman. He was pardoned, and Geralt advised that they leave before she could change her mind and decide to order his execution again. Ciri was then summoned to Vengerberg by Yennefer, and Geralt told her to meet him in Rivia in six days' time.
The Lodge.
After traveling to Vengerberg, she and Yennefer were invited to the Lodge of Sorceresses in Montecalvo, where they revealed their plans to send Ciri to Kovir under a false name to have a child with Tankred Thyssen, the only son of Esterad Thyssen. She expressed that she wished to think it over during her travel to Rivia as she had already agreed to meet Geralt there. Philippa Eilhart proclaimed that her ability to leave Montecalvo and travel to Rivia is dependent on what the Lodge decides, so she put it to a vote; Sheala de Tancarville, Sabrina Glevissig, Keira Metz and Assire var Anahid voted against her leaving Montecalvo, while Triss, Margarita Laux-Antille, Francesca Findabair, Ida Emean aep Sivney, Fringilla Vigo, and eventually even Philippa Eilhart herself voted in favor of letting her leave. She then traveled with Yennefer and Triss to Rivia.
They arrive in Rivia in the midst of the Rivian Pogrom, and Ciri rushed into the crowd to try and find Geralt. After Yennefer and Triss released a hailstorm on the city and stopped the riot, they found Geralt impaled and bleeding out on the ground. After Ciri yelled at Yennefer because her magic was unable to save Geralt, the sorceress lost her consciousness. Ihuarraquax appeared on the lakeshore; his horn started emitting a light which was directed by Ciri on Geralt and Yennefer. The unicorn pointed to a boat; she put an unconscious Geralt and Yennefer in the boat and got in it with them. Geralt came to on Malus Island, and Yennefer informed him that Ciri had left.
After leaving Rivia with Geralt and Yennefer, she traveled to a different world where she met a knight by the name of Sir Galahad who invited her to King Arthur's court at Camelot. She agreed, and the two rode off together, heading to Camelot through the lands of Y Dynan Bach Têg.
Returning Home.
Having hidden in another world for over half a year the Wild Hunt found Ciri, forcing her to flee. At some point Ciri discovered that Geralt had been captured by the Wild Hunt and managed to free him and send him to the forests outside of Kaer Morhen although he lost his memory in the process. Several months later Ciri, along with an elf named Avallac'h, returned from another world and ended up in Skellige where the Wild Hunt found and attacked them. Avallac'h was cursed during this attack before the two could teleport away, but were split up in the process.
Ciri appeared in Crookback Bog where she collapsed and was found by the Crones. The Crones intended to give her to the Wild Hunt however, as she possessed Elder blood, they couldn't decide whether to cut her up for her blood or not. Having overheard this, Ciri escaped and fled into the nearby forest, narrowly evading Imlerith. Traveling west into Velen, she encountered a young girl named Gretka who was lost and rescued her as well as a local man from a werewolf. She was then taken to Crow's Perch and taken in by Phillip Strenger (known as the "Bloody Baron") who alongside his men she befriended. During a race with Philip, the two are attacked by a basilisk and Ciri was forced to use her powers to save him. However, Ciri realized that Wild Hunt would sense her powers so she left Crow's Perch and headed to Novigrad.
Ciri tracked down Dandelion to enlist his help in repairing a phylactery to lift the curse on Avallac'h, though she excluded the identity of her friend. After evading a trap set by the Temple Guard, Dandelion suggested going to Cyprian "Whoreson Junior" Wiley, who agreed to fix the phylactery in exchange for stealing Sigi Reuven's treasure. Wiley later turned on them, capturing and torturing their friend Dudu. Ciri managed to rescue Dudu but her activities got the attention of the Temple Guard, who chased her towards Temple Isle. Just as a crossbowman took a shot at her, Ciri teleported herself to safety.
Ciri teleported all the way to Skellige, landing on the shores of Hindarsfjall, where she fell unconscious, dropping into a lake. Avallac'h and a native Skelliger, Skjall, found the injured girl and took her to Skjall's home to recover. When she came to, Ciri accepted the invitation to heal at the local sauna. But soon as she prepared to depart, the Wild Hunt descended on the village, forcing Ciri to flee once more. She found her way to Avallac'h, who was waiting with a boat. But upon seeing Skjall being cut down by a Red Rider, she attempted to turn back to help him, but Avallac'h stunned her with a sleeping spell and took her on a ship.
Before Eredin's curse fully triggered, Avallac'h managed to bring Ciri to the Isle of Mists and put Ciri in a death-like slumber to hide her from the Wild Hunt. Avallac'h then sailed back to Skellige but the curse took hold, rendering it impossible for him to tell anyone who he was or where he hid Ciri. While Ciri slept, seven dwarves found her in the cabin and hid there as well, though they believed she was dead.
Later on, Ciri was finally found by Geralt and once she was awakened by the magical firefly the witcher was given by a cured Avallac'h, the two embraced and caught up on all that'd happened when Ciri tried to return home, including what'd she learned: the Aen Elle world was facing annihilation and so the King of the Wild Hunt was trying to catch Ciri to use her to open a powerful enough portal to allow an army through to conquer their world.
As they prepare to leave, they discover the dwarves hadn't bothered to wait and took Geralt's boat to flee the Isle, before spotting the Wild Hunt's flagship, the Naglfar, in the distance, forcing Ciri to teleport them directly to Kaer Morhen.
Upon arrival, Ciri happily reunited with Vesemir, Yennefer, and Triss. However, the time for celebration was cut short, as the Hunt would soon assault the aging keep. Despite wanting to fight in the upcoming battle, Ciri was ordered to remain inside the keep while everyone else defended her. However, Ciri defied this order when she saw Triss come under attack by Wild Hunt warriors and rushed to her aid. She later assisted Eskel against Caranthir, before the general heard a war horn signaling him to retreat.
As the Wild Hunt breached Kaer Morhen's inner courtyard, they released a powerful blast of the White Frost, freezing everyone save for Ciri and Vesemir, who'd been behind a wall and thus weren't touched by the blast. Imlerith then attacked the pair and managed to pin Vesemir down, forcing Ciri to drop her weapon and go with Eredin willingly or they'd kill the old witcher. However, not wanting Ciri to give herself up, Vesemir made one last attack at Imlerith, stabbing him and causing Imlerith to snap Vesemir's neck, instantly killing the witcher. Distraught at this, Ciri's Elder Blood powers suddenly broke free in an uncontrollable, crippling scream, making everything gravitate towards her while the intensity of the magic killed anyone that got too close. Nonetheless, Eredin futilely tried to get closer to try and capture Ciri but was dragged back from her by Caranthir and disappeared through a portal. A weakened Avallac'h then appeared from his room in the keep and managed to intervene and stop Ciri's powers before they destroyed the entire keep and everyone else there.
Back in control of herself, Ciri attended Vesemir's funeral pyre with the rest but started to regret returning to Kaer Morhen and, despite Geralt's attempts to calm her, she snatched Vesemir's medallion off the pyre and ran off. She returned a shor time later to find Geralt, Avallac'h, Yennefer, and Triss discussing reassembling the Lodge of Sorceresses to fight the Wild Hunt and became incensed that decisions were being made without her and left once more.
Trying to use the small window they had to recover, Ciri continued to train with Avallac'h but was disheartened that she wasn't progressing well, especially with Vesemir's death fresh on her mind.
Ciri later stirs Geralt early in the morning, revealing she had discovered Imlerith was attending a sabbath on Bald Mountain in Velen, as would the Crones, though she hadn't told Avallac'h of her plans. Geralt can suggest visiting her biological father, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, in Vizima first or go to Bald Mountain immediately.
If Geralt and Ciri go to meet Emhyr, the latter addresses her by all her titles as nobles and soldiers kneel before her. He then presents the second half of Geralt's payment as thanks for finding his daughter. Whether Geralt accepts or not affects Ciri. Ciri then engages in a private conversation with Emhyr but later stormed out, angry at his attempts to buy her.
A few weeks later, Geralt and Ciri arrive at Bald Mountain and are forced to contend with the local celebration, which ends in them being sent to a sylvan named Fugas for execution. After slaying the monster, Ciri plays a game of rock, paper, scissors, to decide who will face the Crones and who would slay Imlerith. Ciri lost the game and thus went to confront the Crones. She interrupts them while they were stirring a cauldron full of human remains, prompting them to transform from beautiful women into their true, hideous forms. Ciri managed to slay Brewess and Whispess but Weavess managed to escape with Vesemir's medallion.
Their mission a success, the pair head for Novigrad, where Ciri had a multitude of personal matters to take care of. With Geralt, she revisits all the people she had encountered in the city. She was also present when Geralt and Avallac'h bring Ge'els from the world of the Aen Elle to show him proof that Eredin murdered the previous Aen Elle king, Auberon Muircetach, so he'd stop supporting the regicide. Ge'els attempt to sow animosity between Ciri and Avallac'h, but it fails. Corinne Tilly, a oneiromancer, shows everyone through dreams of Eredin's regicide.
After Philippa Eilhart and Margarita Laux-Antille are gathered, they ask to meet with Ciri. If Geralt accompanies Ciri to the meeting, it undermines her confidence. The sorceresses extended an invitation for Ciri to join the Lodge as an equal partner.
The party then travels to Skellige to find an elven artifact called the Sunstone to lure Eredin into a trap. Ciri then expresses her desire to investigate Avallac'h secret laboratory in the isles, suspecting the elf to be hiding something from her. She goes ahead with Yennefer to await Geralt's arrival. After penetrating the laboratory, they find a genealogical chart of Elder Blood descendants; Avallac'h was studying all paths of Lara Dorren, even those thought extinct. They soon encounter a she-elf, claiming to be Avallac'h's lover, who proceeds to insult Ciri, calling her a degenerate half-breed and that Avallac'h despises that he needs her. Her words anger Ciri so much that she wants to tear up the lab. Geralt can support her and aid in the ransacking, cheering her up, or calm her down and fasten Lara Dorren's necklace around her neck, depressing her.
Once outside, Ciri asks to go to Hindarsfjall to see Skjall, only to be told of his death. If Geralt refuses, it depresses her. If he agrees to accompany her, they either meet up later or teleport there. Upon arrival, Ciri learns that Skjall was never buried, instead thrown on a corpse heap. After finding his corpse and giving it a proper burial, they are accosted by a band of villagers, who take issue with their defiance against their elders' writ, as Skjall was dishonored and his name stricken. Ciri threatens retaliation if Skjall's grave is disturbed and reveals Skjall's role in saving her from the Hunt, restoring his honor.
The party then sail to Undvik to spring the trap, with the Nilfgaardian fleet preventing the Naglfar from fleeing by sea and the sorceresses blocking their attempts to teleport. As the battle started, though advised to remain on shore, Ciri realized that Geralt and his Nilfgaardian detachment were frozen and decided to go out and assist. Avallac'h advised her to find Caranthir and break the jewel on his staff to lift the spell. After fighting through Hunt warriors and hounds did Ciri engage Caranthir, eventually destroying his staff, though the effort seemingly knocked her unconscious. Caranthir then attempted to grab Ciri, only for her to teleport away.
After Geralt mortally wounded Eredin, the elven king stated that Avallac'h had tricked them both, pitting them against each other while he made off with Ciri. When Geralt confronts Avallac'h as another Conjunction of the Spheres begins, but Avallac'h drops his sword proving that he did not betray them but was just following Ciri's wish to come here. Geralt then confronts Ciri who tells him that she has to go inside the portal to stop the White Frost. Depending on Geralt's interactions with her, Ciri may either survive or die stopping the White Frost.
If Ciri survives and didn't meet with Emhyr or met with Emhyr but Nilfgaard lost the war, Geralt will tell the Emperor that she died saving the world, before later meeting with Ciri to give her her witcher's blade. If Ciri survives and had met with Emhyr and Nilfgaard won the war, when Geralt meets with her in White Orchard, she reveals that she has decided to take her place as Empress of Nilfgaard.
"Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon – what can I possibly say about her? That we call her Ciri for short, that she was born in 1251, that she has ashen hair and a scar on her cheek?"
"All true, and that's the Cirilla I know best, the one I first laid eyes on those many years ago, the one who seemed thoroughly, well, not ordinary, but certainly not as extraordinary as she in fact is."
"For Cirilla is also a highly-skilled witcher, heiress to several thrones, the last bearer of the Elder Blood, a powerful Source endowed with exceptional magic talent and the Lady of Time and Space. Her hair color and date of birth seem... rather incidental now, don't they?"
"I could also tell you she is Geralt's adopted daughter – but that would be a gross simplification. Ciri is much more. She is his Destiny, his Unexpected Child, someone bound to the witcher by Fate's most inextricably tangled fetters."
"Following age-old witcher tradition, Geralt took Ciri to Kaer Morhen when she came into his care. There he and Vesemir taught her in the ways of the professional monster slayer. It was then that her magic talents were first revealed, and they discovered she was a Source."
"Ciri's gift proved a curse as well. Because of it, she would one day have to hide from the entire world – even Geralt."
"Ciri's biography contained one more great secret. Her natural father was none other than the emperor of Nilfgaard, Emhyr var Emreis. His words confirmed the fears swirling in Geralt's mind. Ciri had returned and was in mortal danger, for the unrelenting Wild Hunt was on her trail."
"Yennefer made it clear why the Wild Hunt wanted Ciri: Eredin wanted the power latent in her Elder Blood. She also let Geralt know that Ciri had been seen in war-ravaged Velen as well as in Novigrad, the largest city in the world."
"Reports that Ciri had spent time at Crow's Perch proved true. She was there as the guest of the local warlord, Phillip Strenger, also known as the Bloody Baron. Despite his violent moniker, this man treated Ciri with kindness and respect."
"It seemed that during Ciri's time in Velen she got into a quarrel with some sort of witch or witches in the swamps."
"Geralt learned the truth of Ciri's time in the swamps from the mouths of the hideous Crones themselves. Even Ciri, better able to hold her own than most anyone in existence, was lucky to escape from these powerful beings alive and intact."
"The visions revealed by the Mask of Uroboros made it clear beyond all doubt: Ciri had played a role in the magic catastrophe on Ard Skellig. More importantly, they confirmed she had been in Skellige - and then fled in the face of grave danger."
"Ultimate, tangible proof of the truth that the emperor had spoken the truth about Ciri's pursuers came in the form of a corpse – one belonging to a warrior of the Wild Hunt. The Riders truly were on Ciri's trail."
"In hindsight, putting Ciri in touch with Whoreson was not one of my brightest ideas. In my defense, I can only say that her situation was so perilous even the riskiest plan seemed better than inactivity."
"After many adventures and mishaps, Geralt finally found Ciri on the Isle of Mists. When he crossed the threshold into the room in which she slumbered, the protective spell Avallac'h had cast upon her snapped under the sheer weight of their combined destinies. Geralt was reunited with his adopted daughter after years of separation and searching. No words can describe the joy he felt in that moment."
"Avallac'h's prediction that the Wild Hunt would descend on Kaer Morhen as soon as Ciri arrived was proven true. All present spared no effort in defending her. In the end, though, it was she who defended them – through an outburst of unbridled power, the raw strength of her Elder Blood, she saved the protectors of Kaer Morhen from certain death."
"Though it was Cirilla who convinced Geralt to go with her to exact vengeance on Imlerith, it was the witcher who stood against Vesemir's killer in a final duel. Ciri slayed some evil that day, however, killing two of the three monsterous sisters who had usurped for themselves rule over Velen."
"Ciri had not seen her father since she was a young child. Emhyr was in effect a stranger to her, and one responsible for the deaths of many people she cherished at that..."
If Geralt does not take Ciri to Vizima:
"...It was thus no surprise that Ciri did not even want to see him."
If Geralt does take Ciri to Vizima:
..."Standing face to face with him was surely one of the most difficult challenges she had ever undergone."
If Geralt refuses the reward
"Ciri emerged from this trial victorious, and with an enhanced awareness of how deeply and unconditionally Geralt, her adopted father, loved and cared for her."
"Confronting the Lodge – now there is a difficult task, one many a brave soul would move mountains to avoid. Cirilla, however, decided to stand and face the powerful sorceresses. From the accounts that reached my ears I can conclude that she let the mistresses of magic know..."
If Geralt accompanied Ciri to the Lodge meeting:
..."that she had a mind of her own and would not be a servile tool in their hands."
If Geralt does not accompany Ciri to the Lodge meeting:
..."in clear terms that she had a mind of her own and would not be a servile tool in their hands."
"A visit to Avallac'h's secret laboratory revealed facts that shook Ciri to her core. Though she had long known she was the last of Lara Dorren's line, the only remaining heir to the so-called Elder Blood, only now did she realize this line had been an object of unbroken interest to elven Sages and human mages for two centuries. Another blow came from the words of the arrogant she-elf, which rankled in her heart like a thorny bramble."
If Ciri wrecks Avallac'h's lab:
"Though unleashing anger on inanimate objects might not be considered mature behaviour, it definitely helps bring one relief. Ciri thus reached for this most simple of solutions."
"Eredin had perished - but the evil king's death only ever heralds the end in fairy tales. In our story, this meant it was time for Ciri to face her destiny. Only she possessed the power to stop the White Frost - the near mythical force which threatened not just our world, but countless others as well."

The Unforgiven is the last quest in Chapter III. It is given to Geralt by Declan Leuvaarden and sees our hero finally locate the Salamandra's base of operations.
Walkthrough.
Having completed Lock and Key and updated All the King's Men for Triss and Leuvaarden, Geralt goes back to the inn to discuss his next move. Declan tells him that things are actually worse than he anticipated and that it would be a good idea to bring in some backup, either from the Scoia'tael or the Order. Based on his experience with the factions leading up to this point, the witcher makes his decision.
Scoia'tael path: The witcher decides to side with the Scoia'tael and Yaevinn, so he goes to Golan Vivaldi's house to speak to the elf, or
Order path: The witcher decides to side with the Order of the Flaming Rose and Siegfried, so he finds the knight, who is at his post outside the Cloister, in the Temple District, where he makes a proposal.
His ally agrees to join him and the witcher then goes to inform Triss that backup has been secured. She says that she will set up the meeting at The New Narakort but that Geralt should wrap up any unfinished business first. [She really means it here! Finish anything that you still need to in Chapter III,as you will not get another chance. The second time you speak with her, the conversation will trigger the final events in this Chapter.]
He then continues on his way. Upon entering the inn, depending on his choice in the Beauty and the Beast quest:
Spared and cured the werewolf: Geralt is greeted by Vincent Meis who tells him that the Salamandra are onto him. He and the City Guards will then help the witcher as he is attacked by Salamandra.
Spared but did not cure the werewolf: Geralt is first greeted by Vincent in human form, who tells him that the Salamandra are onto him. He then switches to werewolf form and, along with the City Guards, helps the witcher as he is attacked by Salamandra.
Killed the werewolf: Geralt is "greeted" by the City Guard and their Salamandra informant who positively identifies the witcher as the murderer of Captain Vincent Meis, saying he personally witnessed the whole scene, which might be a half-truth. The witcher tries to explain that Vincent was a werewolf but the guards will have none of it so he is then forced to fight the four city guardsmen and one Salamandra mage.
After the set-to and subsequent looting of corpses, Geralt heads upstairs to the reception room for the rendezvous with Triss, Leuvaarden and his ally who are busily brewing their own grand plan. Unfortunately the meeting is interrupted by Roderick de Wett and some knights of the Order. Since they have no other options, Triss utters the phrase "Alk'h imbagha, harr'a...! Dar'kh ambra der' ha DREAN!" and teleports the witcher and his ally directly to the Salamandra base.
Our hero then finds himself in a cave, the Salamandra base presumably, but alone. Oh well, better than in the middle of a crowded hall full of bad guys, but where is his backup? He looks around and sees some old roots blocking the corridor and decides to break through using a little Aard. He then fights his way through the five or six Salamandra assassins and thugs guarding the place, does a little more "shopping" among the remains, and then continues down the next corridor, hopefully to find Yaevinn (or Siegfried).
Yaevinn: Yaevinn is indeed waiting at the end of the corridor and fills the witcher in on what has happened, including the fact that Triss cast Alzur's Shield on our hero as she teleported him. The elf then points him to the portal, making it clear that there is no time to waste, or
Siegfried: Siegfried is indeed waiting at the end of the corridor and does the same, but blusters on about elven devices before pointing Geralt to the portal and making it clear that they must hurry.
The witcher spies the Professor and Azar Javed at the back of the cave, standing in front of a different portal (more of a round white luminous area). A large group of Salamandra, including two mages stands between him and his targets. The portal is activated allowing the reinforcements to come through. [At first it looks like only three of them come through, but it becomes obvious that more of them have arrived so the "reinforcements" are not as laughable as they initially seem].
A battle, of course ensues and once all the Salamandra assailants have been neutralized, Geralt proceeds to where Azar Javed and the Professor are standing. This initiates a chat with Azar Javed and our hero is subjected to the mad mage's explanation of "the" "Grand Plan". But enough posturing, he forces the issue and goes to finish off Javed. Just as he winds up to deliver his first blow, he is knocked unconscious by the mage who flees through his own portal exclaiming that he has no counter spells for Alzur's shield. Once again he leaves the Professor behind to deal with the witcher alone. The Professor is no fool and runs away down the corridor towards another cave.
When Geralt regains consciousness, he finds his allies are on the other side of a magic barrier, so he is forced to go on alone. He follows the only available corridor through what will be the first of several archways (rough-looking wooden support structures) into another cave. There he finds the Professor at the very back of the chamber with a few minions around to help protect him (as if they could!). The witcher fights his way to the scoundrel and they have a touching exchange of views, which ends with a bit more swordplay and the Professor being knocked down.
He tries to crawl away but he is on his back. He asks for mercy and some classic Witcher humor ensues. Apparently the witcher is not in a mood to be showing any mercy. The Professor then makes one last desperate attempt at demolishing the first or second construction to thwart his nemesis by shooting him with his wrist-mounted mini-crossbow. The witcher then demonstrates the he can indeed parry arrows (or bolts) in flight after all! The Professor then shoots what appears to be some of the stolen witcher equipment from the Kaer Morhen lab which triggers some sort of explosion and they both drop down into the cave below, the Kikimore queen's lair.
After picking himself up, Geralt sees that the Professor is "still" not dead, and is in fact "holding" the witcher's steel sword for him (he is impaled on it). Just as our hero goes to retrieve his weapon, a Kikimore queen erupts from somewhere further underground and finishes off the Professor in a fairly dramatic manner leaving our hero to deal with the gigantic creature alone.
Rather than embarking on a suicide mission, Geralt decides to run straight to the other side of the cave when the queen dives underground. She resurfaces, but luckily not before our hero makes it to the other side. He continues through the archway into the corridor, then spins around and immediately casts "Aard" to collapse the structure. He then sees more smaller kikimora ahead but decides to ignore them. He proceeds, each time he passes an archway he collapses it repeating the same process using "Aard".
The third archway leads to a larger chamber which has a corridor leading out of it. The witcher heads for it hoping to find an exit. On the way he passes one last support post which seems to be carrying an even greater load than the others. He turns around and casts "Aard" on it, like the previous supports. The entire cave collapses behind him, crushing the Kikimore queen and at the same time revealing an exit.
Geralt loots the queen's remains. Since she ate the professor, anything he was carrying will probably be in her gut. He slices her open and sure enough, there are all the Professor's things. He then makes his way out of the cave and finds himself on the Vizima dike, but not alone.
There, surrounded by crossbowmen and a knight of the Order in full armor, is Adda. She condemns the witcher to immediate execution for knowing about her connection to Salamandra and the attempted coup. But, very luckily for our hero and before this can occur, he is teleported to the Lakeside - courtesy of Triss who has been watching the whole thing from wherever she is located at the moment.
This concludes this quest and the All the King's Men quests, updates Berengar's Secret and Witchers' Secrets, and causes to fail any unfinished quests obtained during Geralt's stay in Vizima, except the Won't Hurt a Bit quest. It also marks the beginning of Chapter IV.
Phases.
A Tense Situation.
The party's over for Leuvaarden. Things are getting tense and we need allies. I need to talk to Leuvaarden. "I need to speak with Leuvaarden."
Allies.
Leuvaarden wants me to find new allies. We can't defeat Salamandra alone. The elves, the Order and the Temerian state are the only potential allies I know of. Leuvaarden doubts I'll be able to convince Velerad, so that leaves the elves led by Yaevinn and the Order with my friend Siegfried. "I must convince either Yaevinn and the elves or Siegfried and his friends from the Order to join us."
Trust.
All have refused to help. Seems I need to win their trust. "No one trusts me enough to help me. I need to win them over."
Siegfried's Trust.
It seems Siegfried doesn't trust me enough to risk a mission against Salamandra at my side. "I should get Siegfried to give me an important task. Maybe that's a way to win his trust."
Yaevinn's Trust.
It seems Yaevinn doesn't trust me enough to help me fight Salamandra. He refuses to risk his unit until he's convinced I'm on their side. "I should get Yaevinn to give me an important task. Maybe that's a way to win his trust."
Help from Velerad.
Velerad refuses to help me fight Salamandra. It seems he fears the organization's wrath and doesn't want any trouble in the city. I should look for help from Yaevinn or Siegfried. "Velerad refuses to fight Salamandra, I should speak with Yaevinn or Siegfried."
A Secret Meeting.
I have arranged to meet Yaevinn secretly at the New Narakort. I should tell Triss about it. "I should tell Triss about the secret meeting." (500 XP)
I have arranged to meet Siegfried secretly at the New Narakort. I should tell Triss about it. "I should tell Triss about the secret meeting." (500 XP)
Allies Won.
Leuvaarden was glad to hear I found some new allies. He asked me to tell Triss about it - she's at home, busy with her research. "I should tell Triss about the secret meeting."
Anomalies.
Triss told me we won't be able to defeat Salamandra until she solves the problem with magical anomalies. I guess I should help her. "I need to figure out Salamandra, but to do that I must first help Triss identify the nature of the magic anomalies."
Alvin.
Great, Triss wants me to take care of that Alvin kid. I saw this coming. She won't help me with Salamandra until I do something about the boy. "I have to finish this Alvin business."
Alvin is Safe.
Alvin is all set and Triss should now help me deal with Salamandra. I should speak to her. "Alvin is safe. Time to talk to Triss about Salamandra."
I Should Tend....
I should tend to any unfinished business in Vizima and prepare. When I'm ready, I'll go see Triss. "I should prepare and go see Triss."
The New Narakort.
Everybody's waiting for me at the New Narakort. I should join them immediately. "I should go to the New Narakort."
A Warning / Vincent's Friends.
Depending on your choice in the Beauty and the Beast quest
Spared and cured the werewolf: Vincent warned me about the Salamandra ambush. He and his men aided me in the fight. "Time to leave. My allies await."
Spared but did not cure the werewolf: I was lucky to spare the werewolf's life. Vincent showed his gratitude by telling me about the trap. He even helped me fight the Salamanders. Perhaps he remains a good man? "Time to leave. My allies await."
Killed the werewolf: A terrible misunderstanding... Obsessed by a desire to avenge their captain, Vincent's people attacked me before I could explain that I killed him because he was a werewolf. More human lives on my conscience. "Time to leave. My allies await."
The Trap.
Salamandra set a trap for me at the New Narakort. Things are heating up. I'd better see Triss and Leuvaarden right away. "I'd better see Triss and Leuvaarden right away."
The Salamandra Base.
What am I doing here? I'm inside the Salamandra base, though I have no idea where it is. On top of that - where is my backup? "I'm in the Salamandra base. I must locate my reinforcements."
The Portal.
Yaevinn also managed to get into the Salamandra base. Now we need to activate the portal and let the other Scoia'tael in. "We need to activate the portal and let in the other Scoia'tael."
Siegfried managed to enter the Salamandra base. Now we need to activate the portal to let in the other knights of the Order. "We need to activate the portal and let in the other knights of the Order."
The Power Stone.
I have the Power Stone and can now activate the portal and let in the reinforcements. "I should activate the portal and let in our reinforcements."
A Chat.
I managed to open the portal and let the troops in. The barrier was deactivated when I used the portal. Time to talk to the Professor and Azar Javed. "Using the portal temporarily deactivated the barrier. Time to chat with the Professor and Azar Javed."
Azar used one of the spells from the book against me. It nearly killed me. It's a shame I didn't see through him back there in the swamp. Events would have taken a different course. "The Professor and Azar... I must get them!"
Alzur's Shield, the spell Triss cast on me, scared Azar. He fled, leaving the Professor to his own devices. I put a lot of effort into learning the identity of Salamandra's boss. It was worth it. "Azar and the Professor... I must get them."
The Confrontation.
Finally, eye to eye with the Professor, the man who helped Azar make off with the witchers' secrets... and Leo's killer. "This is the Professor's end... He will pay for his deeds."
The Kikimore Lair.
I defeated the Professor, but that's hardly the end of my problems. I fell into a kikimore lair - I must defeat their queen and get out of here. "I must defeat the kikimore queen and get out of here." (1500 XP)
The Queen.
I succeeded in defeating the kikimore queen. Time to look for a way out. "Time to look for a way out."
Adda.
I found some strange notes among the kikimore's guts. It seems Princess Adda was helping Salamandra! Time to get out of here. I'll try the passage that opened with the second tremor. "Princess Adda was supporting Salamandra. I need to get this information to Triss."
A Partial Success.
I destroyed Salamandra's bases and rooted the organization out of Vizima. I also destroyed the kikimore queen's lair, so those monsters no longer threaten the town. The Professor is dead too, although Azar managed to escape. "I managed to destroy Salamandra in Vizima, but Azar escaped. I need to leave the city too." (3500 XP)

The Professor's Report

The Professor's Report is a letter and quest item in "The Witcher".
This, along with a letter, are all that remains of the murderer known as the "Professor".
"The Professor's Report"
"...Regrettably I must question the benefits of our alliance with Princess Adda. That slut is extraordinarily spoiled and very difficult to persuade. She proved incapable of introducing an effective state of emergency and her ham-fisted forgeries set the witcher on her trail. We will stay true to our word and encourage Adda's delusions for the time being. However, with Foltest returning shortly, we should proceed with the second part of our plan. I presume I will myself resolve the problem with Geralt of Rivia - quickly and in a radical fashion. However, I must insist you cease referring to him as a "son-of-a-bitch" - appellations of that nature are entirely inaccurate, inappropriate and painfully primitive."
"As expected, the substances which were delivered allow us to control the kikimores and their mother. At least the laboratory is working properly, making valuable use of the secrets of Kaer Morhen."

Professor's letter, ready to send

This letter is a quest item which is obtained at the end of Chapter III. It, along with the Professor's Report, are necessary to complete a quest.
Contents.
The Professor's letter
"Azar, you fool! You failed to foresee that the boy Alvin, upon whom we placed so much hope, is capable of opening unstable portals! Shortly after we captured him, the little shit simply disappeared. He was so scared his legs could hardly bear him, and yet he gave us the slip. I spent a fortune finding the teleportation trail, so I know where he is, but I lack people and can't possibly send my imbeciles after him. I have decided to send a man we need to test. True, I doubt his loyalty, but either way we will recover the boy. Send your people to the village of Murky Waters immediately. If my messenger fails to return with Alvin by the time they get there, they should kill him and bring the child to you, to the laboratory. Hurry, time is of the essence."

Ripples is the framing quest for Chapter IV of "The Witcher". It sees Geralt resolve a conflict between the human inhabitants of the village of Murky Waters and the vodyanoi who live in the Underwater City in the nearby lake.
Walkthrough.
This quest is given to Geralt by the either the Friendly vodyan priest or the Fisher King at the beginning of Chapter IV, on the Lakeside. Geralt can either approach the Fisher King or the priest first. If he approaches the vodyanoi priest, he must first kneel before the altar to the Lady of the Lake before the priest will speak with him.
The formalities concluded, he asks the Friendly vodyan priest if he has any jobs for a witcher. The priest informs Geralt that another witcher has been around and taken what work there was and that witcher is most likely in the crypt at the moment. It turns out that this witcher is Berengar.
Geralt finds Berengar inside the crypt and after some impromptu monster-slaying and a heartfelt discussion, decides to take over the contract from errant witcher. Berengar suggests that the easiest thing to do would be to let the two sides just fight it out. This would basically eliminate one side or the other, and the conflict in the process.
Geralt then begins gathering information about the conflict. He speaks to Tobias, who directs him to Julian, saying that it is the merchant who is dealing with those negotiations. Julian explains that the vodyanoi have recently massacred a boatful of fishermen and have taken to human blood sacrifices to a deity known as Dagon. He wants the witcher to kill the vodyanoi acolyte at Dagon's altar to summon the beast and then kill it.
The witcher then goes see the Friendly vodyan priest a second time. He tells the cleric that he has taken the contract back from Berengar and ask to hear the vodyanoi side of things. The friendly vodyanoi does not like Dagon or his worshippers any more than the villagers, but rather than killing a human or a vodyan, they want Geralt to lure the villagers' prize-winning cow to altar and sacrifice it to summon and then kill Dagon.
Geralt may also decide to have a chat about things with the Fisher King. He has been around for a while and knows what is going on. The Fisher King directs the witcher to Black Tern Island to ask the Lady of the Lake for guidance. There, the Lady of the Lake asks the witcher to resolve the conflict between humans and the Vodyanoi. She asks him which side is in the right, and if he replies that the point is to reconcile the two sides, she will be pleased and tells him to speak with the informal leaders of both factions and obtain a gift from each. These gifts should represent some sort of sacrifice and would be symbolic of the groups' good will. She adds that there is a clue to the nature of these gifts inscribed on her altar. Once Geralt brings her the correct items, she gives him a drop of her own blood in form of a ruby to summon and kill Dagon.
Geralt has three options for completing this quest:
Side with the Vodyanoi:
Geralt goes to the enclosure where the cow, Strawberry, is kept and gives her some dried fruits and nuts, her favorite treat. She only needs one treat and she starts to follow him. He leads her out of the village, down to the lakeside, to the boat landing - yes, to the boat. Once on Black Tern Island, he keeps leading her all the way to the Dagon's altar.
Side with the Villagers:
Geralt goes to Dagon's altar on Black Tern Island.
Do as the Lady wishes:
Geralt finds Julian (not difficult, he is always at the Inn) and tells him that it is possible to make peace with the Vodyanoi. He asks him for an alabaster figurine. Next, he goes to see the Friendly vodyan priest and tells "him" that the Lady of the Lake wants to help them solve the problem. He asks the cleric for the gold bracelet. Finally, he returns to see the Lady of the Lake once again and asking her if the gifts are worthy. They are and she gives Geralt a ruby.
Then it is off to the altar, if Geralt is not already there (as he would be if he lured Strawberry there, or killed the acolyte). Again, his next step is governed by his earlier choices.
Side with the Vodyanoi:
He whips out his steel sword and kills Strawberry.
Side with the Villagers:
He kills the acolyte who is innocently standing there.
Do as the Lady wishes:
He places the Lady's ruby on the altar.
Whichever path Geralt chooses, this will summon Dagon and about 13 or 14 more acolytes. He fells them one by one, and having killed them, Dagon falls. The witcher loots his body for a Sun Rune, a piece of amber (sometimes) and some Dagon secretions.
Sided with the Vodyanoi:
If Geralt lured Dagon by killing the cow, he must collect his reward from the Friendly vodyan priest who gives him a Ceremonial sword of Deithwen, which is not that great a sword.
Sided with the Villagers:
If Geralt killed the acolyte, then he must go to Julian who gives him a "Grand Diamond".
Did as the Lady wished:
If Geralt placed the ruby on the altar, then it is the Lady of the Lake to whom he must report his deed. As a reward she will bring back a piece of his memory, which is manifested as one silver talent.
After finishing this quest and having completed The Heat of the Day, the Lady of the Lake presents Geralt with the silver sword Aerondight.
Then, the quest line Alvin can be advanced to its conclusion.
Talk to the vodyan priest first (or Julian first):
The humans and the vodyanoi seem to be in conflict. Another witcher agreed to solve the problem, but then did nothing. They say I can find him in the crypt. "I must go to the crypt, talk to the witcher who took this job before me."
Talk to the Lady of the Lake first (or Fisher King first):
It seems there is friction between the humans and the vodyanoi. I should talk to the leaders of both races, maybe I can help. "I should help the human and vodyanoi leaders settle the conflict between their two races."
Phases.
Factional Leaders.
Berengar told me about the conflict between the humans and the vodyanoi. The humans are led by Julian, while the vodyanoi follow their priest. I need to talk to both. "I should talk to Julian and to the vodyan priest."
Side with the villagers:
Julian wants me to kill Dagon. I can summon the beast by killing his follower who lives in the temple on Black Tern Island. I doubt this will improve relations between the races... "To summon Dagon, I must kill his follower who lives in the temple on Black Tern Island."
Side with the vodyanoi:
The vodyan priest wants me to kill Dagon. To summon him I must kill the villagers' champion cow. Somehow I doubt this will improve relations between the races... I should go to the village and grab the cow. They say it likes fruit and nuts."I must go to the village and lure the cow away. They say it likes fruit and nuts."
Black Tern Island
The fruit and nuts worked. The cow follows me around everywhere. I have to lead her to Black Tern Island and sacrifice her on Dagon's altar. I admit I feel somewhat sorry for the bovine... "I must take the cow to Black Tern Island by boat."
Side with the Lady:
The Fisher King believes the Lady of the Lake can help me resolve the conflict between the humans and the vodyanoi. "I should see the Lady of the Lake"
The Lady asked me for gifts from the humans and the vodyanoi. I must now get Julian and the vodyan priest to agree. "I must go see Julian and the vodyan priest and persuade both to agree to a compromise."
An Alabaster Figurine / Gramps' Diamond / Alina's Garland
Gift #1 (correct gift) : Julian gave me an alabaster figurine from the vodyan city, a gift for the Lady of the Lake. If she rejects this offering, I will have to find something worthier of her. "I must see which of Julian's gifts suits the Lady of the Lake."
Gift #2: Julian gave me his grandfather's diamond, a gift for the Lady of the Lake. If it doesn't suit her, I will have to find a worthier offering. "I must see which of Julian's gifts suits the Lady of the Lake."
Gift #3: Julian gave me Alina's bridal wreath to present as an offering to the Lady of the Lake. If she rejects this gift, I will need to find something else, something worthier of her. "I must see which of Julian's gifts suits the Lady of the Lake."
A Gold Bracelet / The Golden Calf / The Priest's Staff
Gift #1 (correct gift): The vodyan priest gave me a masterfully crafted gold bracelet to present as an offering to the Lady of the Lake. If she rejects this gift, I will need to find something worthier of her. "I must see which of the vodyan priest's gifts suits the Lady of the Lake."
Gift #2: The vodyan priest gave me a golden calf, an idol to offer to the Lady of the Lake. If it is not to her liking, I will need to find another gift, one worthier of her. "I must see which of the vodyan priest's gifts suits the Lady of the Lake."
Gift #3: The vodyan priest gave me his staff to present as a gift to the Lady of the Lake. If she rejects this offering, I will have to find a gift worthier of her. "I must see which of the vodyan priest's gifts suits the Lady of the Lake."
The Ruby
The Lady wants me to be her champion in the fight against Dagon. I must take a drop of her blood, magically enclosed in a ruby, and place it on Dagon's altar on Black Tern Island as a sacrifice. "I must place the Lady's ruby on Dagon's altar on Black Tern Island." (2000 XP)
I killed Dagon at Julian's request. I should see Julian about my reward. "I should see Julian about my reward." (2000 XP)
I killed Dagon at the vodyan priest's request. I need to see the priest to collect my reward. "I must see the vodyan priest about my reward." (2000 XP)
I killed Dagon. I must tell the Lady, she will be pleased. "I must tell the Lady of Dagon's death." (2000 XP)
Julian rewarded me for killing Dagon. The vodyanoi will never trouble the humans again. "Julian rewarded me for killing Dagon." (5000 XP)
The vodyan priest rewarded me for killing Dagon. With the bloodthirsty deity dead, the vodyanoi should cease fighting the humans. "The vodyan priest rewarded me for killing Dagon." (5000 XP)
The Lady rewarded me for killing Dagon. She seemed content that I managed to bring the two races together. "The Lady rewarded me for killing Dagon and bringing the races together." (6000 XP)

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Old Habits Die Hard is an optional quest in Chapter IV given to Geralt by a Naiad he happens to meet on the lakeshore.
Walkthrough.
At the beginning of Chapter IV, we find our witcher appearing out of thin air and falling to the ground at the Lakeside near Murky Waters. After getting the local scuttlebutt from the resolute girl, Geralt meets a naiad on the lakeshore. She tells the witcher that normally she would invite him for a dip, but that she is too upset to do tonight. When he asks about her woes, she tells him that her necklace, given to her by the Lady of the Lake, has been stolen by a drowned dead known in life as Zephyr.
Zephyr it seems is accompanied by a posse of drowners. Several posses in fact. The naiad suggests that to lure Zephyr out, one must first kill his minions, the drowners, at three different locations during the night:
The witcher decides to start by clearing the Lakeside since he is there anyway. He proceeds past the Fisher King's hut to the beach (just north of the Elven cave). There he finds, as expected, a group of drowners and dispatches them quickly. Next.
As he passes the Fisher King's hut on the return trip, Geralt decides to go inside and speak with him. There he obtains permission to use the king's boat, which allows him to get the next group of drowners. He then takes the boat to Black Tern Island, and sure enough, there is a group waiting for him there as well. A few more dead drowners and it is back to land.
Our hero then heads over to the riverbank outside the village, taking the gate out of the village which is closest to the Blacksmith's hut and following the road. He veers off the road towards the river to inspect the bank more closely and there he sees the last group of drowners waiting for him in a nice orderly row. A few pirouettes and flashes of silver later, we have one more pile of dead drowners.
Finally, Zephyr himself appears. He looks exactly like any other drowner. The witcher kills him and searches his remains. He then takes the Naiad's turquoise necklace (and anything else of interest) and heads back to the Lakeside for his reward which can take one of three forms:
Additionally, she gives him a drowner repelling talisman.
Phases.
The Naiad.
I promised the naiad I would find her necklace which was taken by drowners. I should search the Lakeside, Black Tern Island and the riverbank by the village. If I kill enough drowners, their leader, the drowned dead Zephyr, will emerge to challenge me. "I must kill the drowners at the Lakeside, on Black Tern Island and near the village, and then I need to find their leader."
Start at the lakeside: I defeated the drowners at the Lakeside. I have two more groups to tend to before I can face their leader, Zephyr. "I must slay the drowners on Black Tern Island and on the riverbank."
Start on the island: Black Tern Island is clear of drowners. I have two more groups to defeat before their leader, Zephyr, will emerge. "I must kill the drowners that haunt the Lakeside and the riverbank."
Start at the riverbank: Drowners no longer lurk near the village. I need to tend to two more groups before their leader, Zephyr, emerges to face me. "I must slay the drowners on Black Tern Island and at the Lakeside."
Proceed to the island: I have cleared both Black Tern Island and the Lakeside of drowners. I will recover the naiad's necklace. "I must still tend to the drowners on the riverbank."
Proceed to the riverbank: The drowners that haunted the Lakeside and the riverbank are dead. Just a few more and I'll recover the naiad's necklace. "The drowners on the island will be the next to die."
Proceed to the lakeside: I have rid the riverbank and Black Tern Island of drowners. I'll recover the naiad's necklace soon. "I must slay the drowners that haunt the Lakeside."
Drowners.
I killed the drowners I encountered at the naiad's bathing spots. The drowned dead Zephyr should be here soon. I must slay him to retrieve the necklace. "I must slay the drowned dead Zephyr to recover the necklace."
The Necklace.
I defeated the drowned dead who was formerly a thief named Zephyr. I should search his corpse, he should have the necklace on him. "I must search Zephyr's corpse for the necklace." (2000 XP)
Lost and Found.
I have the necklace. I must return it to the naiad. She should be waiting on the beach at the Lakeside. "I should take the necklace to the naiad."
A Reward.
The Naiad was happy to recover her necklace. She gave me a red ribbon that repels drowners in addition to the promised reward. "I have received my reward." (6000 XP)

Enter Geralt of Rivia, professional monster-slayer with a perpetual cash-flow problem. A match made in heaven.

The Innkeeper at the Country Inn in Murky Waters wants three wyvern eggs to try for his famous omelets, as apparently they are quite the delicacy. Since there are plenty of royal wyverns around Murky Waters: on Black Tern Island and in the fields, it takes no time at all for our hero to collect the desired amount of eggs and return for his reward.
Phases.

"Got a hold of devourer teeth? Don't cast them away. Bring ten sets to the witch's hut for a reward paid out in pure gold."
Walkthrough.
Geralt receives this quest by reading the notice board outside the Country Inn in Murky Waters. It seems that the local witch needs them and will reward anyone supplying them. It is not too difficult to find devourers and extract some teeth (at least in Chapter IV!), as they roam the area between the village and the bridge as well as the fields at night. Often in groups of two or three.
Phases.
Devourer Teeth.
The local witch will pay for ten devourer teeth. "I need to collect ten devourer teeth for the witch."
Loot.
I have ten devourer teeth. I'll get a reward if I deliver them to the local witch. "I should see the witch and claim my reward."
Payment.
If you saved Abigail:
Job done. I don't even want to know what she does with those teeth... "I received my reward for the devourer teeth." (300 + 5000 XP)
If you left Abigail to be lynched:
Job done. I don't even want to know what she does with those teeth... "I received the reward for the devourer teeth." (150 + 5000 XP)

The Giant Centipede Contract
"Only buyer of chitinous giant centipede carapaces - come to the elven camp by the lake, be not afraid. Four carapaces earn a decent sum - no doubt about it."
"Elven craftsman"
Walkthrough.
There is certainly no lack of giant centipedes around Murky Waters. All our hero has to do is walk (or run) around the area surrounding the village, specifically the triangular area which includes the fairytale ruins, the riverbank (closer to the road than the river) and the (impassible) bridge to the fields. They are also not too difficult to find, or rather, they seem to have no difficulty finding Geralt. Once he has subdued four of them, he can take their carapaces back to the Lakeside cave and collect his reward from the elven craftsman.
Phases.
Giant Centipede Carapaces.
The elven craftsman is buying giant centipede carapaces. He'll pay anyone who delivers four of them. "I need to collect four chitinous carapaces for the elven craftsman."
Loot.
I have four chitinous carapaces. I can see the elven craftsman and claim my reward. "I should see the elven craftsman and collect my reward."
Payment.
The elven craftsman happily paid me for the chitinous carapaces of the giant centipedes. "I received my reward for the chitinous carapaces." (250 + 5000 XP)

Walkthrough.

It seems that Tobias is very much interested in culling the local alp population and would pay handsomely to have this service rendered. Why this is right up a witcher's alley!...and it is off to collect a few fangs from some alps.
Phases.
Alp Fangs.
The village chief will pay anyone who brings him five alp fangs as proof of having culled a few of the beasts. "I need to obtain five alp fangs for the village chief."
Loot.
I have five alp fangs. I should see the village chief about my reward. "I should see the village chief and claim my reward."
Payment.

The Ancient Cemetaur is one of nine optional trophy quests. This, and the other trophy quest are obtained by killing the monsters, but talking to Tobias Hoffman makes their existence known. Information about other trophy quests is obtained from either Vincent Meis or the Royal huntsman. Only one trophy quest, The Beast of the Sewers, is not optional, making a total of ten.
Walkthrough.
When Geralt first strolls into the village of Murky Waters, one of the first people he meets is Tobias Hoffman, the mayor and chief. When asked if he needs the services of a witcher, Hoffman intimates that there are two monsters plaguing the area: Ureus, the ancient cemetaur and a decidedly "unfriendly" vodyan priest.
As the quests both bring a healthy reward, the witcher decides to keep an eye out for these "beasties". He finds Ureus in the crypt in the Fields, but not before fighting his way through alps, alghouls, ghouls, fleders, other cemetaurs and a garkain.
Phases.
The Cemetaur.
The monster from the crypt in the fields is dead. It probably slaughtered many villagers in its time. I should take the trophy to the village chief and claim my reward. "I need to deliver the trophy to the village chief and claim my reward."
A Reward.
I gave the proof to the village chief and received 800 orens. "I received my reward for the trophy." (800 + 7000 XP)

The father does tell him about the striga's recent activities and also about what the Squirrels have been up to. Geralt then hands in his painstakingly collected cemetaur jaws and collects the advertised reward.

"The Druids"
Walkthrough.
It seems that the druids have determined that bloedzuigers are an abomination to nature. They are working on a way to rid the area of the beasts completely and they need the blood for their genetic experiments.
Phases.
Bloedzuiger Blood.
The druids have posted a notice requesting that someone slay the bloedzuigers that are destroying the swamp's unique ecosystem. I need to supply ten different samples of their blood. The druids will use them to develop a spell that will exterminate the species entirely. "I need to collect ten bloedzuiger blood samples for the druids."
Loot.
I managed to complete the druids' assignment, but I've never seen so much blood at once. Time to vast [] the druids and collect my payment. "I should see the druids and claim my reward."
Payment.
Job done. I hope the druids can restore the Balance. "I received my reward for the bloedzuiger blood." (200 + 7000 XP)

"Jean Pierre"
Walkthrough.
It seems that Jean-Pierre never did secure that promotion to Jägermeister. He is now captain of the mercenaries. To help in the general fight to restore order, he and his men also fight monsters but there are plenty to go around. If the witcher needs a bit of extra cash, killing a few vampires and trading their blood for some gold seems like a good way to make some fast cash.
Phases.
Bruxa Blood.
The mercenary captain put a price on the lives of six female vampires - bruxae who roam the area. Their blood needs to be provided as proof of their death. "I need to slay six bruxae and bring the captain their blood."
Loot.
This should be enough. I have enough blood to see the mercenary captain about my reward. "I should see the mercenary captain and claim my reward."
Payment.
The mercenary captain paid me for killing the bruxae. "I received my reward for the bruxa blood." (300 + 7000 XP)

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Hunting the Wild Hunt is an optional quest in Chapter IV which Geralt can receive from the Hermit in the Fields.
Walkthrough.
While speaking with the Lady of the Lake, or better yet before that, Geralt learned that the Fisher King was not her only servant amoung the local humans. The Hermit, a druid, was also part of her circle and happened to be an expert on the legend of the Holy Grail. He decided to pay the recluse a visit.
The hermit was an obliging fellow who was more than happy to satisfy Geralt's curiosity about the Holy Grail and the Lady of the Lake. In return, the witcher asked him if he was in need of the services of a witcher. Surprisingly (not!) he was. The hermit explained that the King of the Wild Hunt and his band of crazed specters had invaded the fields trying to lure the spirits of the Lady's fallen champions, knights who were buried outside the hermit's hut in the kurgans, into their midst.
He told the witcher that while he can not hope to kill the King of the Wild Hunt himself, killing nine of his wraiths, a sacred number to the druids, would send him on his way. These specters appeared after dark, near the Druids' lantern in the southeastern area of the fields, near the ravine. Geralt must have used mandrake sprinkled on the lantern's flame to keep the King of the Wild Hunt at bay while he killed the nine minions.
Geralt did as instructed and made quick work of the wraiths. He then went back to see the hermit and and collected his reward.
Notes.
You can choose your reward in this quest. Possible rewards are:
Independently of your choice you also receive a pouch of salt talisman for protection against wraiths, worth 120 (300 to the Hermit).
It is possible to do the quest without the Mandrake roots.
Despite what the Hermit says it is possible to kill the King of the Wild Hunt during the quest.
Phases.
The Wild Hunt.
The hermit asked me to kill the wraiths that haunt the Druids' circle. He also told me how to repel the King of the Wild Hunt. First, I need to collect some mandrake root from the kurgans (or barrows) by the hermit's hut. Then I need to place the root in the fireplace within the Druids' circle and light it. "I need mandrake root to drive the King of the Wild Hunt and his specters away from the Druids' Circle."
Mandrake.
I must defeat the wraiths that haunt the Druids' circle. The hermit claims I can keep the King of the Hunt away by placing mandrake root on the fire in the Druids' Circle and lighting it. I must use mandrake root to drive the wraiths and the King of the Hunt away from the Druids' Circle. "I must use mandrake root to drive the wraiths and the King of the Wild Hunt away from the Druids' Circle."
Wraiths.
I defeated several wraiths, but I need to kill more if I'm to drive the Hunt away from the area. "I have to defeat several more wraiths." (500 XP)
The Fire.
I lit the fire and the King of the Hunt no longer troubles me. "I can now destroy the other wraiths."
More Wraiths.
I dispatched several more wraiths. I hope a few more will be enough. "I must defeat several more wraiths." (1000 XP)
The Fire.
I lit the fire and thus avoided having to face the King of the Hunt. "I can now destroy the other wraiths."
Quest Completed.
I defeated all the wraiths as agreed. I should see the hermit about my reward. "Now I can see the hermit about my reward." (1500 XP)
A Reward.
I picked up my reward. The hermit was grateful. He also gave me some wraith-repelling salt. "I received my reward." ( + choice of reward + 5000 XP)

 &lt;data source="id"&gt;&lt;label&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
The Salamander's Tail is a quest which spans the entirety of Chapter I. It begins with Geralt learning of Salamandra's presence in the outskirts and about the Reverend from Shani after the opening barghest attack on Alvin and Caroline, and it ends with Geralt forever leaving the outskirts behind. It is through this quest that Geralt meets just about everyone he does meet in the outskirts.
Walkthrough.
Geralt is hot on the trail of the Salamanders after their daring raid on Kaer Morhen, but he has no idea where to begin his search once he arrives in the outskirts. He must first earn the trust of the Reverend and the villagers before the Reverend will impart any of the information he has on Salamandra, so our hero is on a mission to please as he makes his way around the village.
Ultimately, the Reverend makes good on his promise and reveals the location of the Salamandra hideout in the outskirts. This allows Geralt to disband at least that one part of the larger organization, rescue Alvin from their clutches and to find Abigail, cornered in a cave by the Reverend and his followers.
Notes.
I have discovered that the key to the Salamandra hideout is not technically necessary to enter the hideout. Once its location has been revealed, all Geralt has to do is to fight the two lackeys guarding the place to gain entry to the hut, but not the trapdoor which leads to the cave. So Geralt still must go to the Inn first to rescue Shani and get the key to finish this quest.
Phases.
Salamandra.
The leader of the local community, the Reverend, may have information about the man wearing the Salamander brooch. I must see him as soon as possible. "I should speak with the Reverend about Salamandra."
Distrustful Villagers.
The Reverend doesn't trust me because of another witcher who was here earlier. I must tend to the Beast and talk to the village's most prominent inhabitants - Odo, Haren and Mikul. Maybe I can learn something from them. "To gain the villagers' trust. I must first convince Haren, Odo and Mikul."
Odo first: I gained Odo's trust. Now for Haren and Mikul. "I should see Haren and Mikul."
Haren first: I gained Haren's trust. Now for Odo and Mikul. "I should see Odo and Mikul."
Mikul first: I gained Mikul's trust. Now for Haren and Odo. "I should see Haren and Odo."
 Still need Mikul: So, Odo and Haren trust me. Now for Mikul. "I should see Mikul."
Still need Haren: So, Odo and Mikul trust me. Now for Haren. "I should see Haren."
Still need Odo: So, Haren and Mikul trust me. Now for Odo. "I should see Odo."
Trust Gained.
I gained the trust of the village's most prominent residents. I should tell the Reverend. "I must talk to the Reverend."
The Reverend's Trust.
I've gained the trust of the most prominent villagers. The Reverend won't bow so easily. To convince him, I must finish off the Beast. "Before I can tend to Salamandra, I must deal with the Beast once and for all."
Salamandra.
The Reverend revealed the location of the Salamandra hideout. He also claims I'll find the key to their lair at the inn. "I must go to the inn."
The Key.
I must need the key to the Salamandra hideout. It should be somewhere at the inn. "I must find the key to the Salamandra hideout." (500 XP)
The Hideout.
I have the key to the Salamandra hideout. I should go there now and find the bandits' leader - he may know something about the stolen secrets. Shani promised to wait for me at the inn. "I have the key to the Salamandra hideout. That's where I need to go."
Exit.
The man I followed to this village is dead. Though he was leader of the bandits in the outskirts, he was only a pawn. Salamandra's real leaders are in Vizima. For now, I need to get out of this cave. "I killed the boss of the Salamanders in the Outskirts. I need to get out of this cave." (500 XP)
Getting the Permit.
I killed the Reverend. He deserved to die. I should search his body for the letter that will get me into Vizima. "I should search the Reverend's corpse for the permit that will get me into Vizima."
The Permit.
I have the permit that will get me into the city. I should find Shani at the inn, as we agreed. "I have the permit. I should find Shani at the inn, as we agreed."
The Gate.
Shani and I are going to Vizima. We must reach the gate Mikul is guarding. "I must find the city gate that Mikul is guarding."
Vizima.
Thanks to the Reverend's letter of safe conduct, Mikul let me enter Vizima, but i was arrested. "I have entered Vizima." (3000 XP)

The Sentry is a quest in Chapter II which begins when, at Kalkstein's request, Geralt asks Vaska about the Mage's tower. She tells him what she knows and gives him the Tower tarot card, saying that she has no more need of it. This tarot card reveals how to defeat the golem which holds one of the keys to the tower.
Walkthrough.
After undertaking the Mysterious Tower quest, Geralt runs into some snags. Namely, he needs ten sephirot to open the tower and he can only find eight. It seems that the ninth sephira is inside a currently motionless stone golem in the Golem burial ground in the swamp. Using the tarot card that Vaska has given him and some help from Kalkstein, it becomes clear that the witcher must first wake the golem and then defeat it, in order to retrieve the sephira.
Waking the golem requires a bit of legwork, and it is not cheap either. Firstly, Geralt must have a lightning rod fashioned by either Malcolm Stein (who charges 50 ), or by the Order armourer (who needs instructions and charges 70 ). The choice of blacksmith will depend on which side the witcher supported in Force Recon. Then, once the rod is secured, there comes the question of summoning a storm on demand. Perhaps the druids can help? Yes they can, but it costs another 500 more.
You don't have to pay the 500 orens. There is a much more simple and cheap method. It's also very easy. You can awake the golem without the druids by stabbing it with the lightning rod while it's raining. It doesn't matter if it's sprinkling the tiniest bit. Rain = Free.
Once all the preparatory steps have been completed, there remains the fight with the Sentry, so our hero heads out to the Golem cemetery in the swamp. He finds the beast and jams the lightning rod into it. Since the druid has already summoned the storm, it does not take long for lightning to strike and wake the behemoth. It seems he is less than pleased at being roused.
Next comes a lot of running around. Geralt must touch each of the three stone posts for each "round" of the battle. The first two posts do not seem to do much except attract lightning to themselves. It is only touching the third post that can be tricky. Geralt "must be outside the triangular area" framed by the posts when he touches the third one, otherwise he will be struck too. The flip side of this is that the "golem must be inside that same area" or he is not struck.
It takes three successful strikes to kill the golem. At that point, it can be "skinned" and the Neh'tza sephira, plus its obsidian heart can be harvested. Voilà!
Phases.
A Tarot Card.
Vaska revealed to me the story of the tower. To open it, I must consult the Tarot card that illustrates how to defeat the golem that is the tower's Sentry. "I need to discuss this with Kalkstein."
The Lightning Rod.
To wake the golem up, I have to arrange a lightning storm and get a lightning rod. Piece of cake. First I should find a craftsman - storm without the lightning rod is of little use to me anyway. " I must find a craftsman who will make a lightning rod for me."
Money for the Dwarf / Armorer.
The dwarven blacksmith wants 50 orens for the lightning rod. I have to bring him the money. "I have to bring 50 orens to the dwarf." (500 XP)
The order's armorer will make a lightning rod for 70 orens. I have to bring him the money. "I must bring 70 orens to the armorer." (500 XP)
The Storm.
I bought the lightning rod from the blacksmith. Now I must find a way to create a storm in the swamps. I believe the druids are weather experts. "I must go to the druids in the swamps to find a way to create a storm." (–50 )
The order's armorer will make a lightning rod for 70 orens. I have to bring him the money. "I must go to the druids in the swamps to find a way to create a storm." (–70 )
Druids.
Druids can control the forces of nature, so maybe they can summon a storm for me. I don't think they'll do it for free, though. "I'll ask the druids to summon a storm."
Money for the Druids.
The druids can create a storm for me, but they want 500 orens for that. I have to bring them the money or wait for the natural storm. "I must pay the druids 500 orens for the storm."
Tip: This part and the next can be avoided by simply inserting the metal rod while it is raining, even just slightly, and the normal cutscene will play, saving you 500 .
The Golem.
I paid the druids. I hope the storm is worth its price. I must now find the golem, place the lightning rod in its hand and wait for the lightning. "I must put the lightning rod in the golem's hand." (–500 )
Waking the Golem.
The golem has awoken. I have to defeat it to enter the tower and find the Sephirah. "I must defeat the golem."
The Sephirah.
I defeated the golem. I must take the Sephirah out. "I must remove the Sephirah from the golem." (2000 XP)
The Sephirah.
I got another Sephirah, hidden inside the golem. It was not an easy task. "I defeated the sentry."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Prison Break is the first quest in Chapter II and is necessary to complete before any further progress can be made in "The Witcher".
Walkthrough.
This quest begins as Chapter II dawns, and we find that our hero has unceremoniously been thrown in a dungeon. There are no obvious charges and things look pretty bleak, until Vincent Meis, captain of the City Guard, announces that there is a way to win passage out of prison by defeating a cockatrice which is currently roaming, unchecked, in the sewers. This seems an ideal option for the witcher, but sadly, someone has already beaten him to the punch and volunteered.
Not one to give up so easily, Geralt points out that "he" is the better candidate to kill the monster; the captain consents to let him duke it out with the other volunteer to see who will win a chance to face the beast. A fistfight ensues and naturally, Geralt wins (if not, he simply has to wait for the thug to fail, then take a turn). He is let out of the cell and, before entering the sewer through a grate in the dungeon floor, given a silver sword (this updates Berengar's Secret).
Once in the sewers, Geralt meets Siegfried, a knight of the Order of the Flaming Rose, who has "also" volunteered to hunt the cockatrice alone. Geralt must decide whether or not to team up with Siegfried to fight the creature, but either way, the battle looms. Once the creature is dead, Siegfried shows Geralt the way out of the sewer and imparts some useful information. They part on good terms.
Ascending to street level, Geralt briefly pauses to identify the door to Raymond Maarloeve's residence, then uses his map of the Temple Quarter to find his way back to the dungeon. Captain Meis receives the trophy relatively graciously and authorizes Jethro to return the possessions seized from their newest ex-prisoner. Geralt opens up a smaller cell and the chest inside it... is anything missing?
Phases.
Thug.
I have to fight a thug. The winner will have a chance to win his freedom after killing the cockatrice in the sewers. "I must get out of here. step one: kick the thug's ass."
Sword.
Jethro gave me a silver sword. After killing the cockatrice I should go to him to collect my things. "Jethro gave me a silver sword."
Cockatrice's Nest.
Teamwork:
I've decided to team up with Siegfried. It will be easier to fight together. Apart from that, I will gain the Order's gratitude. I must find the cockatrice's nest in the sewers and kill it. "I must find the cockatrice's nest in the sewers and slay the creature."
Alone:
Siegfried wanted us to stand against the cockatrice together. I refused. The White Wolf hunts alone. I suppose Siegfried will tell his superiors that I'm not too willing to cooperate. I must now find the cockatrice in the sewers and kill it. "I must find the cockatrice's nest in the sewers and slay the creature."
Trophy.
Teamwork:
The cockatrice is dead. Siegfried proved very useful. I should take the creature's head as a trophy. Time to go back up. I don't really like sewers - it must be the aroma, I guess. "I must take the cockatrice's head and leave the sewers." (800 XP)
Alone:
Kill the cockatrice without the aid of Siegfried. Take the creature's head as a trophy and to go back up. "I must take the cockatrice's head and leave the sewers." (1000 XP)
Bandits.
Several Salamander bandits attacked us - I wonder where they came from. I must finally get out of these sewers. "I must leave the sewers." (500 XP)
Deposit.
Siegfried gave me the key to a door leading out of the sewers. Vizima and all its dangers await outside. I need to recover my things as soon as possible. "After leaving the sewers I need to see Jethro and collect my things."
Deposit Returned.
My equipment is in a chest in the cellar. I hope Jethro didn't take anything as a souvenir. He also recommended that I call on Vincent and demand my reward for the cockatrice's head. "I must take my things from the chest and take the cockatrice's head to Vincent." (1500 XP)

The Beast of the Sewers is one of "The Witcher"'s ten trophy quests - the third available, and the only one which is automatically initiated in the course of the main plot (it is not technically assigned by Vincent Meis, but he does require that the cockatrice be slain (and looted) to advance the primary quest, Prison Break).
Walkthrough.
After killing the Beast and escorting Shani to Vizima's walls, Geralt is betrayed by Mikul, who hands the witcher over to the City Guard. All is not lost, though, as Captain Vincent Meis provides a way to win passage out of prison: by defeating a greater cockatrice which roams the sewers. This seems an ideal option for our hero... But first he is pitted against a fellow prisoner ('Muscleman') in a fistfight to determine who makes the first attempt.
Having settled that issue one way or another, Geralt descends into the sewers, where he meets Siegfried of Denesle, a knight of the Order of the Flaming Rose. He can either accept the knight's offer to team up against the cockatrice, or go it alone. This decision will have repercussions during Chapter II.
The 'Cockatrice Lair' is marked on Geralt's map of the sewers even before you find it; approaching it from either direction will trigger a brief cut scene, followed immediately by combat. Addan Aenye is recommended. Also the Igni spell is very effective.
Phases.
The Cockatrice.
I killed the cockatrice and took its head as proof. I should see Vincent now. "I need to deliver proof of having killed the cockatrice to Vincent."
"This phase only occurs if the quest is unfinished when Chapter II ends"
A New Employer.
Vincent no longer holds the key to the coffer. I should see the Royal Huntsman about my reward.
Proof.
I delivered proof of having killed the cockatrice and received 400 orens. "I received my payment for the trophy." (400 + 3000 XP)

Wiedźmin (English: "The Witcher") is Andrzej Sapkowski's first book to be published in Poland (published by Reporter in 1990) but is now out of print. All of the short stories featuring witcher Geralt of Rivia contained in this book were later published in "The Last Wish", the short story collection that replaced "Wiedźmin" as the first part of "The Witcher" series, making this book obsolete.
Aside from the witcher stories, this book also contains "Droga, z której się nie wraca", a story about Geralt's mother, Visenna, which takes place decades before the Witcher stories. This story, while not included in "The Last Wish", was later published in the "Something Ends, Something Begins" collection.
Note.
These five stories were first published in the "Fantastyka" magazine before being collected here: The Witcher (1986), the tangential story The Road of No Return (1988), A Grain of Truth (1989), A Question of Price (1990), and The Lesser of Two Evils (1990).
Translations.
The same set of stories was published in 1993 in Czech as "Stříbrný meč" ("The Silver Sword"). For other translations of stories contained in "Wiedźmin", see: "The Last Wish".

The Witcher armor

The list of available armor is even smaller than the list of weapons. Geralt begins the game with no armor at all, is then given his first studded leather jacket by Vesemir and then there are only two other sets of armor he can acquire over the course of the rest of the game.
No armor.
Geralt looks like he does in the picture with the white outfit. With no armor equipped, he still retains (1) quickslot.
However, it is not possible to carry trophies without wearing any armor as Geralt will not have the required hook then.
Raven's armor.
The highest quality iron ores and state of the art technologies were used in the making of Raven's armor, a legendary suit of armor worn by an even more legendary warrior. It was forged in the gnomes' workshops beneath Mount Carbon, but finished by elves. The songmaster Tyen'sail took an interest in the armor and worked for twelve days straight, each movement of his chisel accompanied by a song of power. It is said that the armor sang a song of victory for its wearer providing him with confidence and calm during battle.
Only three elements remain of Raven's armor: a spaulder, a rerebrace and a gauntlet. Geralt must find these or similar pieces of armor to reforge the protective suit as part of the Armor quest.

Outskirts

The Outskirts of Vizima is a rural area where mostly farmers live. The area's population is led by the Reverend, and is currently suffering due to the attacks of a mysterious Beast which spawns hordes of barghests. There are also some troublesome drowners and a few ghouls lurking about.
"Like any large city, Vizima also has its Outskirts. Near the city walls stand the houses of townspeople who could not afford to live in the city or could not stand the stench of its gutters. A little further out, among the fields and meadows, peasants have their thatched-roof homes. Unfortunately, the hard times have left their mark on the Outskirts. Many houses are vacant, their owners killed in the war, slain by monsters or taken by the plague which ravages the area."

Eskel was a witcher of the School of the Wolf taught by Master Vesemir at Kaer Morhen and active in the 13th century. As the sorceress Triss Merigold noticed, Eskel emanated a strong magic aura. Though less famous than his peer Geralt of Rivia, Eskel became renowned in his own right as a professional, reliable witcher, and for possessing a kind and relaxed disposition.
Eskel and the White Wolf were like brothers. Side by side they grew up, enjoyed pastime activities and endured the Trials. A good friend of younger Lambert and Coën of Poviss, Eskel saw Vesemir as both a mentor and a father figure. He returned to Kaer Morhen each winter to swap tales and rejuvenate for The Path.

Born in the mountains, Eskel originated from hill-folk. His mother used to sing him an old hiking tune about a hen, which would later be the only thing the witcher remembered of her.
Under unknown circumstances, The Witchers' Settlement in the Blue Mountains eventually became his home. He befriended Geralt, a peer who gradually turned into his almost-brother. Together they relished in childish delinquencies. Once, Eskel and Geralt had captured a huge forest bumblebee and tied it to a jug. Watching its antics, the two had fits of laughter until Vesemir had caught and punished them with a leather strap.
Tirelessly studying all sorts of creatures, trainees got to hear teachers repeat jokes about virgins and unicorns or basilisks and mirrors, quickly finding all unamusing. The one they found most primitive—infinite versions of how a young witcher shook his hand with a female dragon. To become full-fledged witchers, the youth had undergone murderous and painful Changes together, the Trial of the Grasses which changed their physiology, granting them, among other things, cat-like vision in the dark. Young Eskel feared for his friend's life when Geralt's hair turned white as a side effect of the Trial, though both managed to beat the odds and survive it together. They trained on The Trail. Leading around the Kaer Morhen through dangerous obstacles, it was generally known as "The Killer".
The Child Surprise.
In the late 1210s, Eskel saved a prince of Caingorn in a dire struggle with a werebbubb gang and was offered anything he wanted as a reward. Given such a wide-open choice, he could not think of anything and instead recited the fabled Law of Surprise "give me that which you find at home yet do not expect" that he had heard Vesemir repeat over the years.
This is how Princess Deidre Ademeyn born during an eclipse became his surprise child. Avoiding responsibility, Eskel took great pains to evade going back. Taking ridiculously long routes to avoid the proximity of Caingorn, he had heard about Deidre maturing into a highly unpredictable lass. Plus she discovered an innate gift of obstructing magic in her area, all superstitiously interpreted as "accursed mutations of the Black Sun". To determine what it all meant, Eskel carried a collective work about the phenomenon. He surmised the Council of Wizards meddled too much into state affairs, botched it and, had they not sent Sabrina Glevissig, Ademeyn might not have become ostracized.
When she sought asylum around 1242, Vesemir hosted her and Eskel busied himself with a kikimore hatchery in the old mine outside Kaer Morhen while devising a solution and where Geralt found him and the two discussed the situation. In a way, Eskel cared and didn't want to pass her to Glevissig who, bursting with unproven conclusions, wished to kill and study Ademeyn. After heading back, Vesemir called his pupils to present ideas. Eskel, unsure, asked Geralt for guidance.
"If the witchers chose not to help Deidre:" The witchers decided not to help her, and Deidre went into a rage, almost fatally attacking Eskel before fleeing, with Sabrina stepping in to heal Eskel's wounds, though unable to remove his deep facial scars. She requested the witchers leave it for her to find and deal with Deidre. It is unknown if the witchers allowed this, but for the next two years, the notorious and murderous outlaw bandit leader Deidre terrorized southern Kaedwen. Eventually she was hunted down and killed, either by Sabrina and her allies who tortured and examined her for mutations, finding none, or killed outright by a mysterious man with a terribly scarred face who refused to collect the bounty that had accumulated on her.
"If the witchers chose to help her:" A scuffle between Ademeyn and her younger brother Merwin Ademeyn, Glevissig's misguided ally poised to rule, caught Eskel inside. Accidentally, the princess slashed the witcher across his face, but deeply regretting it, she subsequently left, resolving the entire matter. Several years later she sent him a letter with her royal seal upon it, but Eskel put it into a fire without reading it and never spoke of her again.
Though the witchers of Kaer Morhen never spoke of her again, none of them forgot her either, each carrying her memory in their heart.
Training Ciri.
Early autumn 1264 had seen Eskel return again for the winter. A certain day, he went to close the main gate to stop heat from escaping when Geralt brought Ciri. Eskel embraced the Wolf and though he was skeptical at first, he nonetheless agreed with Ciri's training. He welcomed the girl at Kaer Morhen and took her luggage. Asked who else was inside besides Vesemir, Eskel responded with the names of Lambert and Coën, their mate from the School of the Griffin. Following months, Eskel helped Ciri train. He was worried, however, by her trances induced by an accidental sip of White Gull.
The third trance scared the witchers most, so they sat down. Eskel, who couldn't withstand the silence, swore and stood up to bring a bottle of something strong. Listening to Coën and Geralt, he took a vodka. Vesemir was furious about the booze in the beginning but later beckoned Eskel to pour him a pint. After more silence, Eskel came up with an idea to summon a witch. When Lambert mocked Ciri's latest prophecy by stating witchers are likely to die by monster teeth, he added dental gangrene may be another interpretation, seemingly serious. Vesemir hushed both, saying they shouldn't joke about it.
They decided to call Triss Merigold who arrived near Midinváerne of 1265. The sorceress noticed Eskel emanated potent magic when he bowed and politely took her hand to kiss it. Initially suspicious she could be poised to reveal witchers' secrets to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, Merigold convinced Eskel of having no such intention. He had a good relationship with Merigold altogether. When she had comments on how witchers treat Ciri, he listened. After determining what to do about Ciri, Merigold told the witchers about the situation in the Northern Kingdoms. Early on, Eskel asked several questions but ceased to as it turned into a dispute about neutrality.
On the path.
Before 1267, Yennefer of Vengerberg visited Kaer Morhen and Eskel met her. As the Second Northern War had neared its end, Eskel was in the vicinity of Brenna. After the massive battle of Brenna, he asked about Coën, who had fought for the North. Not only did he learn the jolly friend's fate, but Eskel retrieved a silver sword once held by Coën, though not the one he had at Brenna. The sword retrieved would then be displayed in the main hall of Kaer Morhen.
He never gained Geralt's renown, even though he equaled the White Wolf in experience and skill. Despite that, Eskel has made a name for himself as an efficient witcher, learned in his trade. One of his recognized heroics was when he saved a little girl from a basilisk, splitting it down the stomach and getting her out. He wasn't paid due to the fact he was wandering those lands hunting zeugl. He didn't avoid adventures either, as he had slept with a succubus and took fisstech with her. During warmer times at Kaer Morhen, Eskel would go out to drive back harpies.
Two attacks on Kaer Morhen.
Salamandra burglary.
One day before Belleteyn of 1270, Eskel and Lambert were both at Kaer Morhen and were supposed to repair one staircase, which they postponed. A day later, Eskel and Vesemir were out hunting in the woods when a magic storm arrived, and they found the unconscious Geralt, till then considered dead, not far from the keep. They encountered specters of the Wild Hunt at the same time that were pursuing Geralt, and under the advice of Triss managed to drive them away. Once Geralt was safely secured, they loaded him on a cart and while his friend laid exhausted, Eskel explained how nobody knew where he disappeared following the Rivian Pogrom. Reassuring the amnesiac Geralt that all would be well, they brought him to Lambert and Triss Merigold back at the keep.
Shortly thereafter, Azar Javed and the mysterious Salamandra struck. Eskel, like all his comrades, defended the keep. Splitting, Vesemir assigned Eskel and Lambert to help him battle Savolla's frightener. Nevertheless, the thugs got the upper hand. Witchers retreated into the upper courtyard, where Merigold blamed Eskel and Lambert for not repairing that staircase as it could have helped the defense. When she also said Salamandra may be there for witcher mutagens, Lambert was skeptical but Eskel supported her. Though he helped slay the frightener, the bandits got away with the mutagens.
After they burned the murdered trainee Leo on a funeral pyre, the witchers split up to seek information. Eskel took western direction as he had contacts there and preferred coast climate. Before leaving, Eskel gave Geralt valuable advice on fencing, hand to hand fighting, and alchemy.
Bounties in 1271.
Through the year that followed the defeat of the mastermind behind Salamandra, Jacques de Aldersberg, Eskel had several contracts. He pierced a fogler, fought a red-skinned insectoid or flamed four wraiths. Next, he had been hired to deal with a hypnotic samovila and free a peasant farmer from it, but left after the peasant fell in love with her, refusing the enamored farmer's wish for him to trap the samovila for him afterwards.
About six months before the clash with the Wild Hunt, Eskel was suddenly ambushed by a Manticore in the forests of Creyden, the beast moving so quickly it didn't set off his medallion. He was injured in the exchange, receiving a sizable scar in the process, but slew the beast and took its head to the closest village's elder. Unfortunately there was no contract on the Manticore's head, and the village elder swore on all the gods it was the first he had heard of the monster, thus Eskel didn't receive any payment for it.
On a search in Aldersberg for a katakan more than a century old and liable to kill drunkards, Eskel had to stalk the opponent for a month before dealing the final blow. Including trying to trap it a masquerade ball held by the nobles to attract the vampire, during which he took the time to enjoy the company of a number of the ladies there. He eventually managed to trick it into drinking blood from a woman alchemist he convinced and paid to be heavily intoxicated with substances that would weaken it. After that he managed to kill it with ease and took its carcass back to Kaer Morhen with him. Proper examination of the vampire's body parts, he believed, could lead to discovering a new witcher method of age determination based on footsteps.
Clash against the Wild Hunt.
Eskel was out pursuing a forktail in the fall of 1272 as the draconid needed to be removed and Yennefer lacked organs to distill ingredients required to disenchant Uma. After Geralt tracked Eskel down, Eskel agreed to let the White Wolf join the hunt and the two talked about recent events going on in their lives before tracking and following the forktail to its lair and finishing it off. Then Eskel mounted his horse and the two made their way back to the keep with a friendly horse race.
Inside, Eskel showed Geralt the katakan specimen and began its autopsy. Later on, as Yennefer started the transformation process on Uma, Eskel was noticeably troubled by Uma being put through the Trial of the Grasses and eventually walked off from it. Though he did return and brought some rags to help clean the floor, and Yennefer after she prompted him, as Uma had vomited on her during the Trial. After Yennefer broke Uma's curse and went to rest, Eskel sat with Lambert to share anecdotes and drink when Geralt joined them.
"If Geralt opts to get drunk with the rest:" Getting increasingly drunk, the three swapped stories, played a drinking game, gwent and dressed as the Lodge of Sorceresses in the hopes of inviting them to Kaer Morhen for some fun. Fiddling with Yennefer's megascope even produced a brief contact with Hierarch Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart of Novigrad. Hence the sorceress of Vengerberg stormed in and stopped the charade. Eskel had to return her the clothes taken.
As Eredin Bréacc Glas realized Ciri was on Kaer Morhen, he attacked and Eskel partook in the ensuing battle. He defended the inner courtyard of the keep. After Caranthir opened a portal and brought a few riders of the Wild Hunt through, Eskel dueled Caranthir, holding his own expertly, until Caranthir utiilized his teleporting, which almost cost him his life. Luckily, this did not happen as fate smiled upon him—Ciri saved his hide. Caranthir retreated after being called away, but not before he ordered his troops to kill the two. Eskel and Ciri then killed the warriors and continued to fend off the Hunt.
Suddenly, icy coldness tore through holes opened by the Wild Hunt, freezing Eskel in motion. He only unfroze after Eredin and the Aen Elle warriors vanished, ousted by Ciri's outbreak of power in the wake of Vesemir's death, with the power of the outbreak causing Eskel's ears to bleed while he was frozen.
Departure south.
In the battle's aftermath, Eskel bid a last farewell to his valiant master. Unable to imagine Kaer Morhen without Vesemir, he decided to watch over the Witchers' Settlement until winter 1273 and return to the Path for an unknown amount of time. Direction—Lormark. He supposed its warlike undertone would provide ample work opportunities.
Legacy.
In July 1267, Ciri experienced a pyromantic vision with a fraction of it showing Eskel and other witchers led onto a scaffold. She had seen Eskel again in a different vision after entering Tor Zireael. When recounting the story about Yennefer, Geralt and herself to Galahad, Ciri changed the end to a happy one, telling the naive knight from another world that, after the pogrom, a splendid feast took place with Eskel in attendance.
Elsewhere, bard Dandelion introduced a ballad "Bitter, Evil Hearts", chronicling the tale of Eskel and Ademeyn. A story about how Eskel saved the little girl from a Basilisk made it into "A Few Remarks on Basilisks and Cockatrices", a book containing useful knowledge for beast hunters. Decades on, by the 14th century, he had become a part of various iterations of the legend of the White Wolf and the witcher girl.
Appearance and personality.
The Wolf witcher had a menacing, metallic voice that sounded like a dog's barking to Ciri when she first heard it. The most prominent feature of his visage was a long, hideous, semi-circular scar running from the corner of his mouth across the length of his cheek up to the ear. It got itchy when he was nervous or embarrassed. Minus the scar and hair color, Eskel and Geralt resembled one another like true brothers. Eskel's hands emanated powerfully with magic, with more Power than the White Wolf's. This triggered pleasant, piercing vibration in mages.
Eskel was calm, patient, stable, thoughtful and polite. Even when he disagreed wholeheartedly with a topic, he feigned politeness and interest in the matter. What betrayed him in such situations was avoiding eye contact. He enjoyed drinking and laughing with friends. Quite self-aware, he had no delusions about his appearance but that didn't hinder him from smiling. His fitting, mature behavior, especially when it came to Ciri compared to the other witchers endeared him to Triss Merigold. Vesemir prized Eskel's reliability.
"The calm and reasonable witcher is my peer. We are similar in many ways and people often think we are brothers."
"All witchers have a great deal in common, but with Eskel and Geralt, the similarities are particularly striking. They first met as two boys of the same age swinging wooden swords at Kaer Morhen. They then went though an ordeal together: the first round of selections, the murderous Changes, the Trial of the Grasses, and training on the Gauntlet - the witchers' daunting obstacle course. They also received hidings together for more than one act of childish delinquency. When they became adults, they walked the Path separately, but still reconvened at Kaer Morhen nearly every winter to wait out the cold, drink to their successes and remember fallen comrades."
"Though Eskel never gained Geralt's renown, he equaled the White Wolf in experience and carried out his contracts with care and efficiency. Death had almost taken him many times during his hunts, yet in an ironic twist the hideous scar on his face came not from a monster claw but from the blade of Deidre Ademeyn, his highly unpredictable Unexpected Child."
"Perhaps this traumatic experience lay at the root of Eskel's dislike for Yennefer, though he tried not to let this get in the way of friendship with Geralt."
"Eskel took active part in the defense of Kaer Morhen, standing bravely in the face of overwhelming odds to fight one of the Hunt's generals. When Vesemir died, he took over responsibility for watching over the witchers' keep."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Lambert was a witcher from the School of the Wolf, active in the 13th century.
Trained by Vesemir, he was known for his biting tongue, and was often rude in conversation, particularly towards Triss Merigold, addressing her only by her last name, which irritated the sorceress greatly. He did not have much use for politics, a trait common to most witchers due to their code of neutrality.
He was described as being at the same age as Coën and one of the last witchers to be trained within the walls of Kaer Morhen.
Biography.
Lambert was born to an alcoholic father who constantly beat him and his mother. Every night, they prayed for his death. One day, his father lost his way returning home from the tavern and stumbled into a Nekker's nest. Unfortunately, a witcher saved him and expecting payment, invoked the Law of Surprise which resulted in Lambert being given to him and was brought to Kaer Morhen. 
His final test was the Trial of the Medallion, Lambert was accompanied by a group of young recruits. Together they sailed across the pond which ended in one drowning to death. They navigated through the caverns when they ran into a cyclops named Old Speartip who slew several of them including Voltehre. After climbing Troll's Head, they encountered a trio of rock trolls whom they managed to avoid. Upon reaching the Circle of Elements, Lambert retrieved his Witcher Medallion and proved himself worthy to set out on The Path.
In 1232, Lambert was at a camp in the Kaer Morhen valley, dealing with an archespore problem, and protecting the keep from possible attackers.
In the autumn of 1267, Lambert went to Kaer Morhen to wait out the winter, along with Vesemir, Coën and Eskel. Geralt arrived one day with Ciri, and wished to train her at the keep, which Lambert spent time helping with, especially in the ways of sword combat on the pendulum. After Triss Merigold arrived at the keep, he spent many a moment arguing with her, referring to her only as "Merigold", to her annoyance.
"The Witcher".
Lambert appears in the main campaign of "The Witcher", as well as "The Price of Neutrality" premium module. Despite not being fond of her, when Triss was sick and wounded after a fight with a wizard, Lambert cared for her helping to nurse her back to health. Vesemir suggests this might be because he feels guilty.
In "The Witcher", he is wandering around the ground floor of Kaer Morhen or busy in the courtyard for the duration of the Prologue.
"The young witcher I met at Kaer Morhen sure is quarrelsome and he has a biting tongue... He is rude, especially to Triss Merigold, who he addresses by her last name. I think at times he uses rudeness to express his fondness for someone."
"The Price of Neutrality" premium module.
In "The Price of Neutrality", he can be found staking out the ford nearest the camp, keeping the local archespore in check and making sure the unexpected guests do not suddenly try to enter the keep.
"The young witcher is quarrelsome and has a biting tongue, though at times he uses rudeness to express his fondness for someone."
Journal entry.
Lambert and another witcher, Berengar, appear in Geralt's dream at the beginning of the second game.
Associated quest.
Lambert is back in the third installment of The Witcher Series and seems to have a deep seated jealousy towards Geralt, as Geralt is an extremely famous and beloved witcher, while Lambert considers his witcher status a cruel twist of fate, and is stuck hunting relatively benign monsters for people who hate witchers.
Like some of his fellow monster slayers, he dislikes the lack of choice he had in becoming a witcher; when he was a child, his father continually beat him and his mother until one day his father stumbled onto a Nekker's nest where a witcher saved his life. The witcher then invoked the law of surprise, demanding the first thing the father would see, yet not expect when returning home. Since that day, Lambert despises his lot in life but walks the path nonetheless, for he knows nothing else.
Later life.
Geralt had a dream in the May of 1272, in which he practised training at Kaer Morhen. When he and Ciri walked down to the lower courtyard, they trained with Eskel and Lambert, or more specificially Lambert trained with Eskel, Vesemir with Geralt and Ciri with a training dummy.
During Geralt's travels looking for Ciri, he could encounter Lambert after taking an ekimmara contract. After they had slain the ekimmara, they got to chatting, and Geralt helped track down three members of Jad Karadin's band, Vienne, Lund and Hammond. After they hunted the three down, they hunted down Jad, and confronted him. Geralt could choose to help Lambert kill him or he could stay out of it.
After Geralt arrived back to Kaer Morhen, after investigating all leads on Ciri, with Uma, he went with Lambert to the Circle of Elements to repair the phylactery. On the way they encountered several problems, such as trolls and foglets. Lambert later participated in The Battle of Kaer Morhen.
"If Geralt got to Lambert in time to save him from the Wild Hunt:" Geralt and Lambert fought the Wild Hunt side-by-side, and both survived the battle.
"If Geralt didn't get to Lambert in time:" Geralt didn't arrive in time to save Lambert and so he died to the Wild Hunt. After the battle was finished they had a funeral in his honor.
"If Geralt convinced Keira Metz to go to Kaer Morhen:" During the battle Lambert was rescued from the Wild Hunt by Keira Metz and soon after got into a relationship with the sorceress
"If destiny truly chooses which boys become witchers, then in Lambert's case it had made a twisted, cruel choice. After hearing his story, Geralt had to admit that Lambert had every reason to be unenthused about the lot fate had granted him."
"A chance encounter of two witchers hunting the same ekimmara turned into a tale of old friendship, murder, and vengeance. The moral of the story? Don't mess with Lambert."
"Though Lambert made no secret of his hatred for Kaer Morhen, when the time came to stand in its defense, he did so without a second thought."
If Keira didn't go to Kaer Morhen and Geralt didn't save Lambert in time:
"Sadly, during the battle, Lambert found himself overwhelmed by enemy forces. Relief came too late and he was cut down by the Wild Hunt's soldiers."
If Geralt convinced Keira to come to Kaer Morhen:
"During this battle, he came within a hair's breadth of losing his life. Luckily, Keira arrived in the nick of time and together they held back his attackers."
"It just might be that Lambert and Keira's later (and somewhat unexpected) relationship came about as a result of that moment, when they fought for survival at each other's side. It is also possible it was a simple matter of two attractive people taking a liking to each other. At any rate, only time could tell what would become of the couple."

Summary.
After walking through the portal in Tor Zireael while narrowly escaping death, Ciri finds herself in a completely different world... an Elven world. She is trapped there with no apparent way out. Time does not seem to exist and there are no obvious borders or portals to cross back into her home world.
But this is Ciri, the child of prophecy, and she will not be defeated. She knows she must escape to finally rejoin the Witcher, Geralt, and his companions - and also to try to conquer her worst nightmare. Leo Bonhart, the man who chased, wounded and tortured Ciri, is still on her trail. And the world is still at war.
The story opens with Ciri bathing in a pond in an unknown world. As she does so, Sir Galahad of the Arthurian legend stumbles upon her. After mistaking her for the fabled Lady of the Lake, they talk and Ciri recounts her story.
The story cuts to a point in time that takes place after the story, where a young maiden, Condwiramurs, meets the Lady of the Lake, Nimue, to study the legend of Geralt and Ciri. They do so through intense study of the pictures portraying the characters and events from the story, to guide dreams. Eventually Condwiramurs starts to dream of the events at the behest of the Lady of the Lake. Her first dream is that of Stefan Skellen and Leo Bonhart, who are revealed to be working for Vilgefortz and have imprisoned Yennefer.
The dream ends and a new dream starts, this time dealing with the adventures of Geralt. Geralt has been completing monster contracts in the Beauclair city of Toussaint while the rest of the group, Dandelion, Regis, Milva, Angouleme, and Cahir, have been exploring and relaxing. Geralt eventually starts a relationship with the castle sorceress, Fringilla. Fringilla is one of the select members of the Lodge, a secret group of sorceresses that wish to control the political world, and is assigned to delay Geralt from seeking out Yennefer and Ciri. Geralt eventually receives a contract to investigate and potentially kill several monsters which live in an abandoned castle near the city of Touissant. While accomplishing the task, he overhears Skellen, Bonhart, and several other associates talk about where Vilgefortz and Yennefer are located and how Ciri is missing. Geralt rushes back to Touissant in order to gather his group and leave to save Yennefer.
Ciri is shown to have arrived in a foreign world after entering the portal at the Tower of the Swallow. This world appears to be ruled by elves, who live in peace except for occasional fights with the unicorns. She meets with several elves, notably Avallac'h and Eredin Bréacc Glas, who is the leader of a cavalry unit called Dearg Ruadhri and reveals that the unicorns have become restless since she entered their world. She is told she must bear the child of their king, Auberon, who appears to be addicted to fisstech and is emotionally cold. Despite her disgruntlement with the situation, she agrees. After several fruitless nights, she confronts the other elves of the castle and demands that she be let go, as it appears their king is not interested in her, and that she wants to return to her friends. She is told that time happens differently in this world, and that once her task is accomplished she will be returned to her time. Eventually Eredin confronts her, giving her a vial and hinting that she should poison Auberon.
In a bout of frustration, she rides her horse, Kelpie, as far away as possible from the castle, despite the warnings that barriers prevent her from leaving the place. As she is riding she is cornered by several unicorns, who threaten to kill her, fearing her power. She is spared, as one of the unicorns, Ihuarraquax, recognizes her as saving him from death earlier. The unicorns then reveal how she can bypass the barriers. She finds Auberon dead from overdose and then steals a boat for herself and Kelpie, which is revealed to be the only way to pass the barriers. She is confronted by Eredin Breacc Glas, who is enraged by Auberon's death and tries to leave abruptly. A brief battle ensues, in which she injures Eredin and escapes to find Ihuarraquax and co. waiting for her. Eredin and his riders soon find her, and a battle between the Dearg Ruadhri and the unicorns ensues. Ciri, in the midst of chaos, teleports out of the world with the assistance of Ihuarraquax.
The story now follows Jarre, a monk who chooses to join the army of all the Northern Kingdoms formed to repel the invading Nilfgaardian army. He meets up with several individuals, including characters seen earlier in the story, and joins a unit called the PFI, or "Poor Fucking Infantry."
Ciri's story continues, where she is jumping between worlds and times in order to find her own, still running from Eredin and the Dearg Ruadhri. She briefly appears before the Lady of the Lake and Condwiramurs, who point the way and wish her luck on her journey as she leaves soon after.
We continue with Jarre: The armies of the Northern alliance and Nilfgaard have collided in a valley near the town of Brenna. The battle lasts hours, teetering the brink of victory and defeat several times. Elven units, led by Yaevinn, attack the flanks of the Northern army, go so far as to slaughter the injured in medical tents. As the Northern army finally starts to rout, a contingent of Redanian cavalry charge over a hill that was not scouted properly by the elves. This causes panic amongst the Nilfgaardian forces, which soon panic and are abruptly slaughtered. The commander of the Nilfgaardians, Coehoorn, is killed in an attempted escape. The battle is referred to as the Miracle at Brenna soon after. The Northern alliance soon push all Nilfgaardian forces south of the Yaruga, which served as the border, and a ceasefire is declared in order to make peace.
Ciri is soon revealed to have gone to Vilgefortz's castle in order to save Yennefer herself, unable to find Geralt and knowing that Yennefer would die without her help. Ciri asks that Yennefer be released in exchange for herself, but Vilgefortz laughs and imprisons her anyway. Geralt arrives at the castle quickly after Ciri, not knowing that Ciri arrived earlier. Geralt and co. storm the castle, killing many of Skellen's men before Milva eventually dies. Geralt and Regis go to find Yennefer, Cahir and Angouleme go to save Ciri once they learn she is here. Yennefer is saved by Geralt, who indiscriminately kills to save her. Bonhart frees Ciri, desiring to kill her in a fair fight. Ciri flees, and encounters Cahir, who fights Bonhart himself to save Ciri. Cahir is killed outright, and soon after Angouleme dies in the same manner. Ciri and Bonhart soon fight, with Ciri finally winning using the environment to her advantage. Ciri takes the three witcher medallions that Bonhart claimed to have taken off the corpses of witchers previously. Ciri runs to find Geralt and Yennefer.
Meanwhile, Geralt, Regis, and Yennefer seek and fight Vilgefortz. Regis is obliterated in the fight, turning into a molten mass of dust. Geralt and Vilgefortz fight, with Geralt being victorious. Ciri eventually finds Geralt and Yennefer, who chose to go outside. On their way to the courtyard, they kill more of Skellen's men. As they reach the courtyard, they find the Emperor of Nilfgaard's men taking the castle and imprisoning any remaining men. The Emperor is revealed to be a long-lost acquaintance of Geralt: Duny, Ciri's father. He plans to marry her so they can have a powerful child. Geralt and Yennefer are told to commit suicide while Ciri will be taken to the capital of Nilfgaard to be married to the Emperor. Geralt, without much of a choice, accepts, and Yennefer and Geralt take a bath together, with a dagger left in the room. In the courtyard, Duny sees Ciri, and regrets his plan. Without revealing their relationship, he kisses her forehead and lets her go free. She goes back and finds Geralt and Yennefer, saying that the Emperor's men left without a word. The three depart, with Ciri leading the way to all of the places during her adventures earlier in the story. They eventually return to Toussaint, and save Dandelion from being executed. The four now split into two groups, Dandelion and Geralt heading to Rivia and Ciri and Yennefer going to meet with the sorceresses' Lodge.
During Geralt's time in Rivia, a riot erupts, in which humans are killing non-humans indiscriminately. He meets a couple of his dwarven friends in a pub, but when they are targeted by the mob he enters the fray and kills several individuals before being impaled by a pitchfork. Ciri, Yennefer, and Triss Merigold arrive in Rivia shortly after the rioting starts, and they eventually find Geralt on the verge of death. Yennefer attempts to use all of her magical strength to revive him, then passes out beside the witcher. Ihuarraquax shortly appears and channels her power through Ciri to heal Geralt and Yennefer. Ciri sends her trusted mare, Kelpie, with Ihuarraquax to their world. The rioting moves away from the area, and Ciri brings their bodies out onto a boat on a nearby lake. While Triss, Dandelion, and their dwarven friends say their goodbyes, Ciri takes off into the lake which erupts into a light and the three disappear.
Ciri ends recounting her tale to Galahad, who has been listening intently the entire time. Ciri says she "could" claim that the tale ends with Geralt and Yennefer waking in an unknown location, comforting each other; that they marry, and that a celebration ensued between all the different dead and alive characters of the saga.
Galahad eventually invites her to the court at Camelot, which she accepts. The saga ends with Ciri and Galahad riding side by side, holding hands.

The People of the Outskirts are a community comprised mainly of farmers and their families.

The rest of the information on this page is of a more general nature and does refer to the inhabitants of the Outskirts as a whole.

The following journal entry is gained by wooing one of the peasant girls with a bouquet of tulips. It and the associated romance card relate to this one experience only. There are, however other sexual encounters to be had in the Outskirts.
"Though the peasants here seem gloomy and unpleasant, the Outskirts nevertheless have their advantages..."
Note: If you turn in both The Salamander's Tail's "Trust gained", as well as Of Monsters and Men's "Alvin's Prophecy" stages prior to giving the Peasant woman the tulips you will loose your chance of receiving her Romance card and with it this Journal entry. Turning in either stage is fine, however due to the nature of both quests it is easy to accidentally turn in both at the same time in the same dialog, locking you out of the option (outside prior saves of course). It is therefore advised to speak to her prior to turning in either stage.

Foreign Lands"by Marco Knopf"
"The Nilfgaardian Empire is gigantic. It was once but a single realm that went on to conquer neighboring lands and assimilate their populations. Today all who hail from the south are called Nilfgaardians, though some take offense as they have sought to preserve their national identity."
"Nilfgaard is ruled by a tyrannical emperor. He tolerates no opposition and knows no pity. Some call him the White Flame Dancing on His Enemies Barrows. His symbol (and the Empires) is a silver sun on a black background. It is worth noting that the female ruler of the Valley of Flowers (the sole existing elven state) considers herself a vassal of the emperor."

Transmutations and Metamorphoses

Transmutations and Metamorphoses is a book in "The Witcher".
An intricate alchemical treatise presenting a theory concerning the animation of inanimate matter. This is the book you should read to be able to have the "correct" conversation with the Alchemist at the workshop in the Trade Quarter in Chapter III.
Transmutations and Metamorphoses"by Adalbertus Aloysius Kalkstein"
"To follow the example of the sorcerer from the tower, we first need to classify substances, diving them into superior and inferior varieties. Only the former can be described by the theory of interdependence presented here."
"Inferior substances do not produce a chain of quasi-life structures, for their nature is substandard in quality and they cannot exist independently. However, it has been proven that they are paradoxically essential for the chain to exist in spite of their inferiority. The hypothesis of interdependence assumes that the chain of quasi-life must contain one substance of each superior element. Nonetheless, the chain's structure, proposed by Raffard the White, has one too few paces for them, namely only five. If the chain were transposed and then transmuted, the problem would easily be solved. Alas, the first operation cannot be performed without damage to the chain's integrity. The only solution is to use a so-called reversed transmutation, which will eventually cause the chain to rotate. As a result of rotation all six superior substances will constantly leave and join the chain without destroying it. From the holistic point of view, there will always be six superior substances occupying five places. The ingenuity of this solution lies in the chain having all the qualities of the three inferior substances. Thus the paradox of interdependence, or as some say coexistence, is no longer a problem."
"Unfortunately, since none of the modern works describe how to perform reverse transmutation, the problem of animating the inanimate remains unresolved."

Sorceresses and Sorcerers is a book in "The Witcher".
It describes the most important sorcerers and their influence on politics.
Sorceresses and Sorcerers"by Marcus Marcellinus"
"The Brotherhood of Sorcerers ceased to exist after the revolt on Thanedd Island, when some of the mages were accused of serving Nilfgaard and were arrested or killed. All the important sorcerers were there for a meeting due to transpire on the following day. Neutral mages also perished during the fighting. Among them was Hen Gedymdeith, who remembered the beginnings of human colonization."
"Soon after, Tissaia de Vries committed suicide. Her death marked the end of the Brotherhood and the advent of a new order."
"After the revolt on Thanedd Island some of the surviving sorceresses grew in prominence. Philippa Eilhart consolidated her position at Redania's court, while the elf Francesca Findabair, queen of the Valley of Flowers, expanded her involvement in human affairs. Triss Merigold, a younger sorceress representing Foltest's interests, also joined in shaping the new order."

Lara's Gift is a book in "The Witcher".
An elven version of Lara and Cragen's legend.
Lara's Gift"based on an elven fairy tale"
"...but even pleas and invocations didn't soften the stone hearts of the dh'oine, the cruel and merciless humans. And when Lara grabbed the carriage door, begging for mercy — not for herself, but for her child — the queen ordered a thug to swing his sword, cutting her fingers off. The winter cold set in that night, and on a hill amidst woods, Lara drew her last breath while giving birth to her daughter, whom she protected with what warmth was left in her body. And even though night, winter and blizzard were all around, springtime suddenly came to the hill and feainnewedd flowers bloomed. To this day those flowers are found in only two places: the valley of Dol Blathanna and on the hill where Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal died."

Balisse fruit is an alchemy ingredient that is needed to craft the following items:
It can be found as random loot, gathered from plants, or purchased from the following merchants:
Balisse fruit should actually be offered by way more merchants, including but not limited to every single herbalist, but is artificially restricted from doing so on the Novigrad/Velen and Skellige maps. The limitation applies whenever more than 3 of it are supposed to be present, and the likely intended logic is that any larger stack would just be reduced to that, but instead gets outright removed. This is also the reason why Keira only sells balisse fruit in Kaer Morhen and not while she's in Velen.
More merchants can also theoretically offer it by virtue of "randomly" selecting amounts lower than 3, but due to a separate randomization bug, that never seems to happen either:

Fool's parsley is a swamp plant with fleshy leaves. It is abundant in both the swamp and the swamp cemetery. The leaves of this plant contain fibres which can be woven into a magic shirt which can transform a man who has been turned into a swan back into a man. At least according to the woman in the brickmakers' village.
According to the druids, it can also transform a werewolf back into a man but only as long as their real identity is known and the man has not become a monster on the inside as well.
