Sabrina Glevissig of Ard Carraigh was a Kaedwenian sorceress and an advisor to King Henselt, as well as a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. She was related to Jade Glevissig, another famous sorceress.
Biography.
Early life.
In the 1180s, Sabrina was studying at the magical school of Aretuza on Thanedd Island. She made friends with the young Yennefer of Vengerberg and their relationship would develop into a rivalry of sorts, though later both feigned friendship with each other, but privately claimed to be the younger of the pair, taking offense at being called each others' former classmate. The two graduated in 1186, and Sabrina would go on to become a royal advisor at the court of King Henselt of Kaedwen.
First Northern War.
In 1263, during the First Northern War, Sabrina travelled with the Brotherhood of Sorcerers to Lower Sodden, where they fought alongside northern armies, including the Kaedwenians, in the Battle of Sodden Hill against the invading Nilfgaardian Army.
Thanedd coup.
In June 1267, she was invited to the Grand Mage's Conclave on Thanedd, and arrived on the last night of the month, the night of the banquet. At the beginning, she talked to Yennefer with her company, the witcher Geralt of Rivia, and the two exchanged some courtesy as well as hidden insults and parted ways. She then later talked with Marti Södergren about Geralt, who stood near them and could hear what they're saying. They talked mainly about his relationship with Yennefer and how they didn't understand how he could date her. Sabrina then said that if she had the chance she would bed him even on rocks; going as far to eavesdrop on his conversation with Dorregaray of Vole.
After everyone was fast asleep, she joined her Northern allies in the early hours of dawn, and started to arrest the traitors allied with Nilfgaard. As Radcliffe and her were leading a dimeritium-shackled Vilgefortz out of his room, his assistant Lydia van Bredevoort attacked them from the side, though in the scuffle Lydia was killed by her own blade, likely at Vilgefortz's orders. Sabrina, Triss Merigold and Radcliffe were dealing with her body when Geralt was brought in. She was then sent by Philippa Eilhart to get Marti Södergren out of bed, as Hen Gedymdeith was dying and needed treatment. After summoning Marti, and Hen Gedymdeith's death, Sabrina would fight Vilgefortz and his associates, and would somehow manage to escape the island.
First meeting of the Lodge of Sorceresses.
On August 5th, Sabrina was one of the few sorceresses invited to Montecalvo by Philippa to attend a meeting and officially form the Lodge. Sabrina was at first spiteful toward Francesca Findabair for betraying the Brotherhood and siding with Nilfgaard during the coup. She also expressed her distrust against Assire var Anahid, due to her belief Assire was spying for Emperor Emhyr. Amongst these accusations, she also questioned if Philippa was spying for Sigismund Dijkstra, due to their history as lovers.
Philippa then revealed that the Lodge would be formed only by women, Sabrina suspecting this was due her newfound sexuality, though she then also stated that men were indeed mentally unstable for the group, subjecting to emotions too often and under critical circumstances non-reliable.
Sabrina, afraid that the Lodge would require becoming apolitical, warned everyone that she would not give up her political influence. Mainly because she served Henselt, but also because Nilfgaard would hunt down the sorceresses for the loss in the Battle of Sodden Hill. She then unintentionally insulted Assire for her looks by stating her thoughts on the appearance of Nilfgaardian sorceresses, and then the group finally conglomerated and agreed to work together.
Second meeting of the Lodge of Sorceresses.
Sabrina attended the second meeting of the Lodge in Montecalvo, at the beginning refusing to eat oysters, and stating that she preferred sliced, cold venison with plums. In response to the comment, the dish was immediately brought out by Philippa's magic. When Francesca teleported in, accompanied by Yennefer and Ida Emean aep Sivney, Sabrina hatefully stated that only Vilgefortz was missing, as a toxic note against Yennefer.
The meeting started by discussing the events of the war and current world troubles. Sabrina declared that for preserving the future of magic, they should mainly serve the purposes of sorcerers, meaning their role in society and service to their allegiances would peel back, and the people would understand the necessity of magic and sorceresses.

Appearance and personality.
She was known for her vivid beauty, fiery temperament as well as forceful and blunt nature, and was rumored to be able to interrupt the king by thumping her fist on the table and yelling that he should shut up and listen - and he would indeed shut up and listen.
She often wore provocative outfits to underline her predatory beauty. She had dark eyes and long dark hair, and a slightly larger hooked nose, which, together with her predatory dark eyes made her resemble the classical portrayal of a witch. To the ball on Thanedd, she wore a black chiffon blouse and a crimson skirt with a side slit that went up to the hips, which she matched by her diamond and onyx earrings. For the first meeting of the Lodge, she wore a turquoise dress with a provocatively plunging neckline and a large, lace, standing-up collar, beautifully framing her coiffured hair, which was held in a diamond tiara.
"The Price of Neutrality" premium module.
Sabrina appears in this premium module for "The Witcher", originally released without voices in April, then re-released as part of the in a fully voiced version in September 2008.
Based in the surroundings of the Kaer Morhen stronghold, "The Price of Neutrality" finds Geralt coming back to the witchers base of operations for the winter. Coming across a small camp near the stronghold, Geralt meets a nobleman and Sabrina Glevissig, who are trying to find a young woman staying in the stronghold.
Born under the Black Sun and prophesied to ruin the world, Deidre is Eskel's surprise child and the sister of the nobleman who wants to make sure she will not have the crown. Sabrina wants to kill her as well to examine her body and discover the truth about the Black Sun — being a witcher, Geralt has to choose who he sides with.
Sabrina stays in her very luxuriously appointed tent in the camp across the ford from the keep. She uses a particularly impressive illusion to bring her interior décor up to her standards. This décor also includes a "boy", actually a young man, presumably conjured to help her while away the lonelier times as she waits for Deidre to be delivered to her. She also dabbles in sales.
Sabrina buys and sells:.
and she will buy wolf pelts, basilisk hides, books and most potion ingredients.
"Sabrina Glevissig is one of the most powerful and influential sorceresses in the Northern Kingdoms. She lives in Ard Carraigh, Kaedwen's capital, acting as an advisor to King Henselt. The sorceress, who is sometimes unceremonious and quick to judge, is justly called the "true daughter of the Kaedwenian wilderness." She often underlines her somewhat predatory and vivid beauty by donning provocative outfits."
"Sabrina arrived at Kaer Morhen while pursuing Deidre Ademeyn. She suspects the girl of being a mutant affected by the Curse of the Black Sun, which renders her a monster, a serious threat to the human race. To prove this contention, the sorceress must capture Deidre and subject her to detailed testing."
Inconsistencies with the books.
"The Price of Neutrality" takes place before the Witcher saga, even though in the books Geralt first met Sabrina on Thanedd Island, in "Time of Contempt".
Sabrina Glevissig is a secondary character in ".
"The sorceress Sabrina Glevissig was from Ard Carraigh, the capital of Kaedwen, and had been King Henselt's advisor. The reader, however, should not be deceived by that term – this true daughter of the Kaedweni wilderness was famous for her determination and temperament. There was no exaggeration to the rumors that on many occasions she would interrupt the King, thumping her fist on the table and yelling that he should shut up and listen - and the King would indeed shut up and listen. Sabrina Glevissig's predatory nature was paired with an equally predatory beauty, which she emphasized through appropriately chosen attire. Add to that the power she commanded as a sorceress, and it should become clear to what she owed her strong position not only in Kaedwen, but also beyond its borders."
"This position could not protect her from the king's wrath, however, and when she failed Henselt one time too many, the sorceress ended up at the stake, where her life ended."
If Geralt chooses Roche's path during the end of chapter I:
"Sabrina cast a curse on the monarch and the battlefield with her dying breath. Many years later we were to feel the effects of this malediction."
"Sabrina had become a martyr in the eyes of some soldiers, thus possibly achieving greater esteem in death than she had enjoyed in life."
"It cost Geralt a great deal of sweat, but he finally found a solution to the problem. Sabrina's spirit finally found solace, and the curse she had placed on Henselt was lifted."
Journal entry.
There is a gwent card with her name. It is part of Geralt's initial base deck for Northern Kingdoms.

Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal was the daughter of Shiadhal and Auberon Muircetach. She was an elven sorceress who fell in love with Cregennan of Lod, a mighty human mage, after the Conjunction of the Spheres. Their union was very controversial for both races.
After Cregennan died, Lara gave birth to their daughter, but died herself soon after, orphaning the child. Cerro, the queen of Redania at the time, adopted the half-elf girl and named her Riannon.
The descendants of Lara Dorren, which include Ciri, are regarded as special, for their magical gifts are considered to be very strong as they carry "Hen Ichaer", Elder Blood.
Andrzej Sapkowski.
Lara Dorren is also mentioned in "Baptism of Fire" through "The Tale of Lara Dorren" told by both humans and elves.
"The Witcher".
During the game, Geralt can read two books that tell the elven and the human versions of the lovers' tale, Lara's Gift and The Story of Lara Dorren and Cragen of Lod.
Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal was an elven sorceress, called Aen Saevherne, a Knowing One. She carried Hen Ichaer, Elder Blood, which puzzles even us elves. As fate would have it, Lara fell in love with a human sorcerer, Cregenan of Lod. Other humans could not bear it and began persecuting them. No pleas would soften the stone hearts of the cruel and merciless dh'oine. When Lara, begging for her unborn child, grabbed the door of the royal carriage, a man-at-arms lashed out with his cutlass, chopping her fingers off. When the nighttime frosts came, Lara languished on a forest hill. She gave birth to a daughter whom she protected with what warmth remained in her waning body. Though through the night a blizzard had raged, spring suddenly appeared on that hill and feainnewedd bloomed. To this day those flowers grow only in Dol Blathanna and on the land where Lara breathed her last. You must understand the importance of her artifacts. She was exceptional to us, someone whose loss defies words, no matter the language...- Yaevinn,  "The Witcher"
It is suggested that Alvin might be a descendant of Lara Dorren.

Riannon was the orphaned daughter of Lara Dorren and Cregennan of Lod, and thus the 4th great-grandmother of Ciri. Cerro, the queen of Redania at the time, adopted her soon after her birth and named her. When she was 17, her beauty was well known and many ruling houses vied for her hand in marriage. Out of them, Riannon married Goidemar, the king of Temeria.
Three years later, Falka's rebellion broke out and a pregnant Riannon was imprisoned and gave birth to twins, Fiona and Amavet, and went mad. That did not stop Falka from giving her own newborn daughter to the prisoner to nurse, though. When the rebellion was quelled, Riannon returned to her husband, but with three children in tow. Due to her insanity, Riannon was unable to tell which one of the children was not hers and, when she finally did recover, she couldn't remember much that'd happened during her imprisonment. Despite this, Goidemar and Riannon eventually raised the three as their own.
However, roughly 18 years later, she died at 38 years old, believed to have been overcome with grief after the death of two of her children, Amavet and Adela, within a year's time.

Vysogota of Corvo was a physician, surgeon, alchemist, researcher, historian, philosopher and ethicist, as well as a former professor at both the Oxenfurt academy and the Imperial Academy.
Biography.
Due to his dissenting opinions in politics, some of which led to him secretly trying to take on the then emperor, he ended up in the dungeons but was ultimately just exiled from the Empire. However, this also meant he couldn't live in any of its territories or face imminent death. While he originally settled in the Pereplut marshes in Ebbing, the lands were later annexed by Nilfgaard, thus putting him back in the Empire once more. To further cause problems was the fact that, after Emhyr took back the throne, high treason sentences handed down by former emperors didn't go away with a new ruler. Tired of being forced to wander, Vysogota decided to remain in the marshes and hide instead.
It was in the swamp, that the old lecturer found Ciri, close to death. He took her back to his hermitage and nursed her back to health. Eventually, after Ciri had regained her health and decided to venture back out into the world, Vysogota died alone on the floor of his hut, with a banshee screaming in the distance.

Source

A Source is a person born with a natural affinity for magical abilities which are rather difficult to control once they have bloomed, which can sometimes lead to mental illness, like catatonia, if not helped.
History.
Bekker's search.
In the 760s, after the First Landing of humans and construction of a settlement, Jan Bekker and Giambattista put the children of the settlers through a magical test as they arrived, in order to reveal Sources. The selected children were taken from their parents and brought to Mirthe, the first seat of the mages, and trained.
Source training.
Schools of sorcery, like Aretuza and the facility in Ban Ard, were created to help these children cultivate and control their powers, lest the abilities drive them mad. At one point, if one learned of a Source, mages from these schools would hunt them down and tear them away from their families by force or deceit. However, this practice eventually died out by the 1260s and was replaced with a softer approach: any mage that learned of a Source was required to inform the Chapter of Wizards so they could keep an eye on the Source and, at the right time, try to fascinate them with magic to bring them into the fold.
Limitations.
Stressful situations usually work as the trigger of a Source's ability. However, this is double-sided: while Sources can wield an extreme amount of power, it's completely uncontrollable and will only happen when they least expect it as they act more like a transmitter of magical energy, rather than wielders of it. This can lead to dire situations where even a castle or half of a town can be destroyed if not brought under control.

Ithlinne Aegli aep Aevenien was a legendary elven healer, astrologist and oracle. She had a gift for divination and prophecies, the best known of which is Aen Ithlinnespeath. Ithlinne's Prophecy has been observed to have correctly predicted a number of things, such as the Northern Wars (1239-1268) and the plagues of 1268, 1272, and 1294.
 "Ithlina, in reality Ithlinne Aegli, daughter of Aevenien, the legendary elven healer, astrologist and diviner, famous for her predictions, divinations and prophesies of which the most famous remains Aen Ithlinnespeath, known as Ithlina'a Prophesy. Indexed and transcribed many times in various forms, the prophesy enjoyed considerable popularity during a number of different periods; the comments, clues and explanations concerning it conveniently adapted themselves to the events of the time, reinforcing the general conviction of the existence of the great gift of second sight of Ithlina"
 "In particular, it is believed that Ithlina predicted the Nordling Wars (1239–1268), the Great Plagues (1268, 1272 and 1294), the bloody war of the Two Unicorns (1309–1318) and the Haak Invasion (1350). It was equally believed that she predicted the climate changes observed beginning at the end of the 13th century (The White Frost), which popular superstitions always associated with the end of the word and the prophetic arrival The Destroyer []. This fragment of Ithlina's prophecy was the trigger of the infamous Witch Hunts (1272–1276) and caused the deaths of numerous women and unfortunate girls, who were mistaken for the incarnation of The Destroyer. Today, Ithlina is considered as a legendary figure by a number of researchers, and her "prophesies" as contemporary apocrypha cobbled together from bits and pieces, an ingenious literary fraud.."
 Effenberg and Talbot
 "Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi", Tome IX
"The Witcher".
"The Witcher" introduces another situation the prophetess might have been describing with the words of her prophecies: the time of the white frost. She is mentioned in the Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi.

Flourens Delannoy (d. 1510) was a linguist and a historian from Vicovaro who lived roughly 200 years after the Northern Wars. He was also the author of "Fairy Tales and Stories" (also translated as "Tales and Legends") that features stories from and about the time of the witcher Geralt and his contemporaries.
By the time "Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi" was written, his treatises became viewed as classics of the ancient language of the Empire's northern regions.
Biography.
He was born in 1432 in Vicovaro.
In 1460, at 28, he became secretary and librarian to the imperial court, a position he held until 1475, when he moved to the academy in Castel Graupian to be a professor until his death at 78 in 1510.

Biography.
Elven massacres.
Several years after Geoffrey Monck established good relations with the elves, Milan led his forces north along the Pontar to Loc Muinne and massacred the entire population of elves in a violent pogrom. Following that, he went to Est Haemlet and did the same, murdering every nonhuman, regardless of age and gender. This set into motion the first elven-human war, a violent conflict that pushed the elder race further east, and ended in the massacre at Shaerrawedd.

Meve

Meve, lauded as the White Queen and sardonically dubbed the "Merry Widow", became the Queen of Lyria and Rivia after the death of her husband. She was related to King Foltest of Temeria and Queen Calanthe of Cintra (with whom she shared a close friendship since their youth). Married at a young age to King Reginald, Meve was the mother of two sons, Villem and Anséis, neither of whom she deemed a suitable candidate as her successor.
She was a staunch ally of King Demavend III of Aedirn. When the Great War broke out, her domain was absorbed by the Nilfgaardian Empire. Donning plate, she headed a guerrilla campaign and, during battle, obtained a mutilating face scar - and the reputation of being an unflinching heroine. Afterward, she participated in the negotiations at Cintra and subsequent celebrations in Novigrad.
Biography.
Youth.
One of many daughters Queen Kalis gave the king, Meve was born to the Lyrian branch of an old House of Raven. She grew up at a palace of Lyria. After her mother had been removed, the new queen gave birth to at least two sons. Interested in the military rather than needlework or dance, Meve had been initially refused fencing lessons by her parents and thus had to sneak into the kitchen and practice alone or with her brothers. Though tutored by a host of governesses, the princess would still climb trees and read memoirs of generals instead of romance.
Meve developed personal distaste for the House Obert, long in conflict with the Ravens, and its leading member Greta. After meeting Calanthe, her distant cousin from Cintra, they became close. Among other things, Meve would notice hot-blooded Cali—as she called the Cintran princess—shuffling feet in excitement whenever a handsome man passed beside them. Their friendship and affection resembled true sisterhood more than anything. In time, malicious rumors of incest arose forcing Calanthe to look for a spouse in remote Ebbing. 
Marriage to Reginald.
At the age of 16, a decision was made to marry her off. A host of nobles dismissed her when seeing post-practice bruises until King Reginald of Rivia fell in love with the princess. At first, Meve seldom behaved like a loving wife. Trying to appease her, Reginald bought Ofiri tapestries, sapphire-studded necklaces, a Koviri lute—all fiercely discarded. At last, a full-body gilded plate armor proved the right gift. Once, in the late 1240s, Meve went hunting to Waldenrad for the first time and had a soft spot for it ever since. 
She delivered two sons, Villem and Anséis, both taking after their father. Casual about his foolishness and sporadic cheating, Meve held the king dear. They spent winters at Rivia Castle.
During the drought of 1258, Meve roamed the two kingdoms to see how her subjects fared. That was when she witnessed first-hand the extremes people were driven to in times of famine.
Taking the reins.
In 1259, Reginald, with his last breath, advised Meve to trust none but Reynard Odo and expired. As neither son was ready, he left Meve as the interim regent in both Rivia and Lyria. Hoping to manipulate her, the Lyrian Council of Peers accepted. Opportunist foes who perceived Meve as inexperienced struck forthwith. The queen replaced silk with the gilded suite from Reginald and mounted her steed to confront them.
The commanders of the Lyrian-Rivian Army were initially skeptical of her to the point of ignoring orders. After beheading a few, the rest submitted. Steadily the queen won all battles. Lacking any regular training and having trouble to recognize siege weapons, Meve used her memory of various generals' tracts and intellect to beat capable warriors. The foes surrendered before winter. 
Easing in tense relations between Vizimir II and her cousin Foltest at the beginning of the 1260s prompted a wedding of Frisanna and Fulko, where Meve sent an ambassador. Around this time, at least before June 1267, Meve entered into a military alliance with Temeria.
Shortly thereafter, Black Forces wrought ruin on Cintra. Calanthe committed suicide to avoid being captured. At a conference in Maribor, Meve agreed to assist the reprisal of the Four Kingdoms, sending a force with Captain Odo. Nilfgaardian Empire, soundly defeated at the Battle of Sodden Hill, called for a truce which she sealed.
The Great War.
Meeting at Hagge.
In 1267, Meve had been summoned to Hagge by Demavend III. Going there, Meve was well aware of Foltest's long-standing romance with Maria Louisa La Valette, courtesy of her spies. At the start, Meve remained a silent listener to Demavend, Foltest, Vizimir II, and Henselt of Kaedwen, occasionally twisting her lips into an ambiguous grimace. Whilst Vizimir talked of the Nilfgaardian threat, Meve lifted her head. She thought she heard crows croak outside but realized it was just wind.
As they talked about Nilfgaard, Meve stressed they, unlike the North, could afford to wait before striking. Vizimir praised Meve for a precise remark, adding that the Emperor disturbed a stone resulting in an avalanche—issues with nonhumans, the influx of cheap imperial goods, the Scoia'tael, etc. Finding it hard to reach a solution, the kings paused to look at Meve for guidance. She advised they should opt for decisive action, a thought which reinvigorated attendees who decided to use Cintra as a uniting symbol.
Foltest mused its lost heir, Calanthe's granddaughter Cirilla, should be deemed dead. Meve asked him whether he intended to secretly find her and use Vissegerd's volunteers to expand his own kingdom. When her cousin refused, offended that he wouldn't think of marrying a child, Meve snarkily nodded he wouldn't for he loved Baroness La Valette. They subsequently decided to restore Cintra's sovereignty but couldn't agree on the Princess' husband and king. Meve rejected the idea of her sons, proposing one of her knights instead. To get ahead of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, the kings silently agreed, to Meve's dismay, that the child had to die.
Escape to Aedirn.
Still, before reaching her palace, the Queen ordered her land to secretly prepare to attack Nilfgaard. Her troops were to be redistributed as close to the borders as possible. There, they would await the Aedirnian Army and overcome Imperial border garrisons.
At one point in late June, a troop of Lyrian cavalry clashed with a mounted Nilfgaardian unit. After hearing about this, Meve loudly accused the Empire of provocation and called for help from Demavend. What she didn't know, however, was that the Emperor was one step ahead.
On a night from 1 to 2 July, Nilfgaardian force disguised as Lyrians and Aedirnians seized Glevitzingen on the Imperial border. Moments after, a group of Demavend's heralds escorted by Lyrian soldiers – all of whom were quite possibly still disguised Black Ones – informed the locals that Aedirn was taking control. Claiming this a casus belli, the Imperials crossed the Yaruga immediately, conquering the Lyrian border castles Scala and Spalla in mere 3 days. Rivia was prepared for months of siege but capitulated under the promise of no harm. Henselt, who was to aid Meve and Demavend owing to the alliance they signed at Hagge, opted to strike a pact with the Emperor instead, taking control of the coveted Lormark.
Meanwhile, in Lyria, Meve herself ended up a victim of a coup organized by Count Caldwell and backed by Duke Ardal aep Dahy, the Nilfgaardian commander tasked with the eastern front. Arrested and confined in a tower while they installed Villem as a puppet king, Meve escaped only barely before Caldwell's henchmen came to kill her. She was helped by few loyalists led by Count Odo and Gascon the outlaw.
Hoping to regroup together with Demavend, Meve got on a way to Aldersberg. Her loyal soldiers fought Nilfgaardians ferociously alongside the Aedirnians in the first battle of Aldersberg, which took place in mid-July. However, numbering only around 5 or 6 thousand warriors, they were soundly crushed by the numerically superior enemy under Menno Coehoorn. Following the battle of Aldersberg, a rumor spread far and wide making many people believe Meve disappeared and perished in the wake of the Empire's onslaught. The fact was that she reassembled with the survivors from her army and they recruited anyone available, including mercenaries and ordinary marauders.
With the battle lost, Meve and Demavend escaped the burning Aldersberg through a secret passage. His army all but annihilated, Demavend confided the queen of his decision to retreat and regroup in exile. When Meve told him she wouldn't follow and instead remain to liberate her realm, he proceeded to give her several soldiers as well as the Leaden Ring—a token of friendship from dwarves of Mahakam. Asking how it may serve her, Meve learned the ring could make dwarven Elder-in-Chief, Brouver Hoog, liable to hear her out and thus increase her chance to get a volunteer corp full of dwarves. Demavend also bid Rayla to guide Meve to the dwarves. With this, the march towards Mahakam began. It hence took var Emreis mere twenty-six days to crush the two.
Allies in Mahakam.
Galloping through the fields of Aedirn and then along perilously steep trails, Meve entered a region known as the Mahakam Pass, which led to the capital of Mount Carbon. There, amidst the snow, Gabor Zigrin awaited the Lyrian retinue. Before the dwarf could properly greet them, though, a large shadow fell on them all as a red dragon named Keltullis soared over them. As the Queen set foot in Mahakam, she only knew dragons from colorful engravings and ballads she heard at her court. Coincidentally, one such story Meve heard was about Yarpen Zigrin and the dragon Ocvist. Nevertheless, Gabor Zigrin quickly assured everybody that Keltullis wouldn't pose danger.
After Rayla introduced Zigrin as their local guide, Meve went straight to the Elder-in-Chief. As it was, the Elder Hoog was just in the process of Spring Cleaning – an annual event of monster removal caused by ice trolls, shaelmaars, and others cropping up when the snow melts for a bit. After young Zigrin explained to her what she was witness to, Meve summoned her banners and rushed to help with the cleaning. Right thereafter, Meve and Odo were brought to the Elder-in-Chief, who inquired Zigrin who the guests were. When the Queen began to speak, Hoog cut her off, saying that he knew full well she either came for coin or fighting bodies. He then proceeded to note how, over the centuries, he had come to realize meddling in human affairs only brings trouble. Refusing the Queen's request he summoned his warriors, announced the end of Spring Cleaning, and went back to Mount Carbon.
Seeing Meve disheartened, Zigrin advised the Lyrians to go around some of the principal clans of Mahakam seated in the Pass, help them get rid of monsters, win over their hearts, and that then the Elder Hoog would be compelled to reassess her request. And so they went, battling the rage wrought by Keltullis on Clan Ferenc after its dwarves broke her eggs, slaughtering through the monsters of Davor's Abyss and Boro's Rump and resolving the enigma of the missing excursions into the Black Brook Vale among other feats. The clans rejoiced, and so when Meve sorted out Davor's Abyss and saw the Elder-in-Chief's runner, she expected praise from him and a pledge of aid. Hoog, however, was irate. At Langbridge, he explained to Meve that he didn't eradicate the beasts earlier because he was investigating the fall of Clan Fuchs. The Queen was then invited to Mount Carbon, where the Elder planned to question her at length.
Walking across the Langbridge, they were attacked by Scoia'tael. When the dusts settled and everybody was safely at Mount Carbon, Meve and Hoog talked. The Elder admitted he originally intended to rebuke her again, overriding the clans, but after seeing how the Empire was using Scoia'tael, he decided to "use" Meve. A feast ensued, but not all of it was delight for the Queen. Escorted by the Imperials, King Villem, her son and rival, summarized the situation in the North to her and begged her to surrender. She refused resolutely and, following a short argument, left. With the feast concluded, the Lyrians met with the Mahakaman "volunteers". And hence a regiment of sturdy dwarven spearbearers, dressed in white doublets displaying Rivian diamonds, joined the war.
Campaign in Angren.
Reinforced, Meve directed her retinue to Angren. Gradually growing in strength, the White Queen's corps developed such a bravado that they crossed to the other bank of the Yaruga and harassed the imperials in every possible manner. Located just south of Lyria and Rivia, Angren served as an important source of food for the Empire. It was also full of bogs and woods, ideal for guerrilla warfare.
The region held an allure for reasons of revenge, too. After all, it was there Count Caldwell had been granted the title of Palatine. When she finally found out in which part of swamps he was, Meve defeated and killed Caldwell in the Battle of Tuzla Castle. On her way towards Red Port, Meve was forced to make a detour through Ysgith, a particularly monster-filled part of Angren. There, thanks to the help of witcher Ivo of Belhaven, the queen killed Gernichora, a terrible relict which nested in the swamps.
When Meve reached the Red Port, an unpleasant surprise awaited her. The Imperials mustered a force under Commander Morteisen at the single bridge leading out of Angren to put an end to her attacks. With no other way through, Meve led the charge to face Morteisen's soldiers. There, in the heat of the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga, the Queen received an unexpected aid in the form of another witcher, Geralt, and his companions, who also needed to cross the river. Fighting her enemies head-on, Meve received a blow from a war hammer which left a mutilating scar on her cheek and broke several of her teeth. Ultimately, though, her warriors won the day.
In the aftermath, Meve entered the field hospital to reward the witcher who happened to help her. Supported by Count Odo, she proceeded to knight him, elevating his status and officially granting him the title "Geralt of Rivia"—finding it amusing to bestow such a moniker on him. Upon receiving the honor, Geralt accompanied Meve as one of Rivian knights. His companions lavished in royal favor as well. On their way towards Caed Dhu forest, the army was alerted about a Nilfgaardian punitive expedition coming their way from Klamat in great numbers.
To avoid it, Meve decided to head north instead. Geralt, who needed to go see the druids of Caed Dhu, asked the Queen to exempt him from the army with royal blessing for his private quest. In a cool yet resolute tone, Meve refused, reminding the knight of his duties to the crown. He and his company therefore left quietly, stealing some provisions and horses in the process, which made the Queen furious.
Reconquest.
Now with a mighty host in tow, she returned to Rivia as a legendary liberator and both the Nilfgaardian Military Intelligence and Vilgefortz' cronies closely monitored her activity. It was, in fact, her guerilla campaign in Angren crowned by the victory that helped overturn the situation in the war as a whole. With bands of resistance rising throughout conquered realms of the North such as Verden, Nilfgaard had to withdraw the bulk of its forces from Lyria and Rivia to face them. Presented with an opportunity to retake her lost lands, Meve didn't hesitate.
Villem, aware fact that he couldn't defeat her, offered her an alliance. At the ruins of the Devil's Tower, Meve heard out her son's proposition, who maintained he would join her if he remained the heir to the throne, his advisors wouldn't be punished, and his already-authorized reforms remained in place.
"If Meve doesn't accept:" Those conditions, however, sounded unacceptable to Meve's ears, and Villem was forced to return to his castle empty-handed.
"If Meve arrests Villem:" Angered by his audacity, Meve ordered her troops to arrest Villem on account of treason, then toss him in the dungeons and keep him there until his death.
"If Meve accepts Villem's condition:" Although her own son stabbed her in the back and sold her own country to Nilfgaard, Meve finally forgave Villem and accepted his conditions. She praised his impertinence, calling it a trait worthy of any future king akin to self-confidence. Her own conditions were that Villem would abdicate and fight at the fore every time, which Villem promptly agreed to.
Approaching the city of Rivia, Meve liberated Broadhead, Kaveldun and other towns from Imperial garrisons. At last, she got to the Rivian capital with its massive donjon. After long, strenuous battle for Rivia Castle, her troops ousted Ardal aep Dahy, who escaped to the ruins of Aldersberg with what remained of the East Army Group. Upon repelling a relieve force sent to aid aep Dahy, the Queen began preparations to march for Aldersberg and deal with him once and for all.
Reaching Demavend and Henselt, who had come to terms at about this point, she learned of a Nilfgaardian messanger, Caldwyn, and intercepted him. Discovering that he carried an order from the Emperor which would force aep Dahy to poison himself, the Queen laughed and allowed him to deliver his message. A while later, the three alied rulers, strengthened by Redanian reinforcements, routed the Nilfgaardians in a decisive battle, despite the Empire still having a significant numerical advantage.
Victory achieved.
In late March 1268, she, along with a number of other important Northern monarchs, reached Cintra in order to meet with Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, an ambassador heading the Emperor's delegation, in order to set up a peace treaty. After her arrival, Meve and her entourage were assigned a part of the city to stay in during the discussions.
Before entering the throne room for negotiations, the monarchs walked through a small gallery full of heraldic emblems and coats of arms of Cintran nobility, both the ancient and more recent. There, Meve pondered about the fate of her dear cousin Calanthe, her daughter Pavetta and granddaughter Cirilla. A moment after, Hierarch Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart – accepted as the talks' chairman – beckoned her to take a seat at the round table. When the talks got around to Lormark, Henselt frantically refused to hand it back to Demavend. After Chancellor Sigismund Dijkstra asked him to calm down, Henselt scolded him for such a remark, exclaiming that he was a "king, for fuck's sake", causing Meve to snort how apparent that was. The argument then continued, but Meve entered it only once to praise Demavend's choice to recognize Dol Blathanna's autonomy. One ironed-out clause pertaining to Meve's monarchy, Lyria in particular, stipulated that the thousands of resettled Nilfgaardians would be repatriated, taking home only what could be carried over the shoulder.
After several topics were concluded, Meve brought up the status of Cintra. The Northern rulers expected to have a few different options, such as making the Cintran capital a free city and ruling the rest as a jointly-governed principality. Nilfgaardian delegation, however, quickly brushed this aside, announcing the coming wedding of the Emperor with Princess Cirilla. On 2 April, the final draft of the Peace of Cintra was signed, ending the war. To honor the imperial wedding, bells rang throughout Cintra and a new portrait showing the Queen-Empress was hung in the palace. Approaching it, Meve thought the girl looked utterly unlike Calanthe, Pavetta or Roegner of Ebbing. She remembered the rumors about a decoy, but decided to keep it to herself.
Not long afterwards, great celebrations were held in Novigrad. Meve along with other monarchs, including late Vizimir's wife Hedwig of Malleore and young son Radovid V, was seated at a review stand to witness the fireworks and the parade of victorious forces. When the Mahakam Volunteer Army marched below them, many of it's members showed what they thought about budget cuts via crude gestures, to which Meve commented the kings' weren't supposed to apply them. She then went on to note they shouldn't have insulted such an ambitious nation as the dwarves.
Restoring power, again.
Albeit Dandelion posited the queen wouldn't hold a grudge for long after their desertion and even allow Geralt to stay in Rivia if she knew he was there, Meve cursed the white-haired witcher's name whenever she heard it. 
During the eventful summer 1271, when, following Demavend's murder, Henselt invaded Aedirn, Meve didn't come to its aid. Whilst Yarpen Zigrin mused about a regiment of heavy arbalists from Lyria, the defenders in Vergen concluded Meve wouldn't risk extra casualties after having her army bled dry in the prior war with Nilfgaard. 
Alas the peace didn't last. In August, Nilfgaardians took the border patrols by surprise and captured most of her territory before December. Unbeknownst to her, the one-time operatives of Temerian Intelligence, Bernard Ducat and Vernon Roche, parleyed with Field Marshal Havart var Moehoen behind everyone else's back, offering to stop fighting Nilfgaard, assassinate Radovid, and accept its annexation of Aedirn and Lyria in exchange for Temeria's autonomy. Concurrently, Dijkstra plotted to take over Redania as chancellor again, refuse the deal with the Emperor and unite the remainder of the North until it won.
At any rate, by 1275, Anséis decided to join the International Knights' Tourney in Toussaint for a the third time in a row. She dissaproved, and forbade him to participate. Nevertheless, the younger son disobeyed Meve, who then noticed his prolonged absence from the palace and sent a message to him. In it, she informed Anséis that she ended his monthly allowance regardless of his placement and wished him fun.
Legacy.
In the end, Queen Meve went down in history, both popular and chronicled, as a stern but just, bold and unyielding monarch, earning her place among the likes of Bienvenu the She-Wolf or Calanthe the Lioness. After all, she wasn't frequently dubbed "a second Calanthe" by contemporaneous scribes for nothing. Moreover, even before she died, the tales of her match with the dragon Keltullis got widespread to the point where Rodolf Kazmer, a wandering merchant, heard several of them during his journeys. That and all other stories from Meve's first guerrilla campaign were relayed by Borch Three Jackdaws to his captors while on their way to Zerrikania.
Personal Emblems.
Meve's personal badge portrayed a lion rampant, tying back to Coram I, holding a sword of the prominent Delen family from Temeria in one of its paws. She also used elongated royal pennants in colors of her kingdoms, flown in cities and castles where she stayed.
Appearance and personality.
By August 1267, when she was nearing 40, Meve's hair turned greyish white, although they appeared blonde from a distance. Combined with the white coat of her horse, they earned her the moniker of "White Queen". Despite such hair shade, her face displayed no signs of aging like wrinkles. Ironically enough, the White Queen was a figure inserted into the Ithlinne's Prophecy by Nilfgaardian propagandists alongside the White Flame shortly before the Great War to make the eventual arrival of Emperor Emhyr and his wife seem legitimate. As Geralt remarked, Meve looked mature but not old. Meve had light green eyes, full lips and was considered overall good-looking. When in a good humor, the Queen sported a charming smile. Her jewelry consisted solely of a necklace with enormous rubies inside. After the crucial battle in Angren, she received a disfiguring scar on her lip and lost several teeth. This made it difficult for Meve to pronounce sonorants. In the end, the wounds healed well enough to not hinder her speech, though remained visible. Meve was overall an athletic woman, still being able to climb trees in her mature age as easily as she did in her youth, proficient in several melee weapons and often fighting along her soldiers. She has occasionally flown into bursts of murderous rage against opponents she found particularly treacherous, but knows usually not to take unnecessary risks on a battlefield.
From among the Northern rulers, Meve was seen as the wise and cunning one, benefiting from the intuition of a woman. Unlike the other monarchs present at Hagge, she was firmly against infanticide. The Queen was a mostly quiet participant in royal deliberations, but when she did speak she tended to cut to the heart of the matter and all listened to her. Though not overtly religious, Meve would silently pray to Melitele when terrified. During the Second War with the Empire of Nilfgaard, when she refused to give up and formed her guerrilla forces, Meve gained the far-reaching renown as both courageous and steadfast, with the bard Dandelion assigning her the epithet "Sun Slayer". 
Whenever available, Meve valued peaceful resolutions and cherished those who did the same. Emotional bursts, so innate to Henselt, by contrast, only amused her. On top of that, Meve often held those of a more "sensitive" constitution in disfavor and, as a result, her relationships with her sons was strained from the very start. This was notably the case with her elder son, Villem. However she did, ultimately, care for both her sons, accepting they were different from her. With her husband dead, Odo grew to be Meve's closest friend, aide and confidante, secretly harboring feelings for his liege.

Forensic Medicine

Forensic Medicine is a book in "The Witcher".
This book is useful considering the Anatomy of a Crime quest.
Forensic Medicine"Milo Vanderbeck"
"Before beginning an autopsy, we must gather as much information as possible to help us interpret any marks we discover on the body. It is good to know who the victim was and in what setting the corpse was found. Witnesses should be questioned and experts consulted."
"A well conducted autopsy gives almost as much information as talking to the victim. We can learn when death occurred, its circumstances, and what happened to the body afterwards. We may also learn about the murderer, any objects used in the murder and the manner of their use."
"A corpse cut with a scalpel is like an open book. Whoever examines the details and carefully tests every hypothesis will understand it."

Cults and Religions of the Nordlings

Cults and Religions of the Nordlings is a book in "The Witcher" and is a treatise on the local religions of the Northern Kingdoms, written by a Nilfgaardian.
Cults and Religions of the Nordlings"Stefan Keller"
"Among the numerous faiths of the Nordlings, the most widespread is the cult of Melitele, a goddess in three forms: young girl, mature woman and old hag. Melitele is a Mother Goddess, caring for her children. Primarily women pray to her, though men in need might also utter supplications. The religion is a vestige of the old matriarchy and testifies to the weakness of the Nordlings — people who worship female deities are soft-hearted and incapable of preparing their sons for war."
"In recent years, the cult of Melitele has found a rival in the cult of the Eternal Fire, which came out of Novigrad. Clerics of the Eternal Fire demonstrate fanaticism and almost complete devotion. The religion is hostile toward any form of otherness, including non-humans. The Order of the Flaming Rose is the cult's military arm."
"The treatise also examines other faiths, including the cult of the Lionhead Spider."

Butcher of Blaviken

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Butcher of Blaviken is one of Geralt's monikers and was dubbed on him after the fateful events that transpired between him, Renfri, and her gang in Blaviken.
History.
Geralt happened to be passing through Blaviken just before its busiest market event once a year, where it drew in people far and wide to sell and buy goods. Around the same time, Renfri and her gang were in the area, as the ousted princess had a score to settle with the local mage, Stregobor (who was using the alias Irion).
Both tried to get Geralt to side with them by killing the other, as Renfri had been hunting the mage for some time for his role in casting her out of her own kingdom (as Stregobor was a firm believer in the curse of the Black Sun and Renfri had been born on one such fateful day) while Stregobor wanted the princess killed so he could stop hiding and return home himself. Ever neutral though, Geralt refused to take a side and planned for them to sort out their own mess by themselves.
Despite this, Renfri dropped a hint the day before the marketplace event about the Tridam ultimatum before saying Geralt had won and she'd leave the next day. The next morning though Geralt realized it was a ruse from the hint and that Renfri and her gang planned to do a similar event by taking the market goers hostage and kill them off one by one until Stregobor came out of his tower and thus raced to the marketplace.
There, he ran into the gang members who hadn't acted yet as Renfri had gone to the tower alone to give the mage the ultimatum first. Not wanting to take any chances of innocents being killed, Geralt and the gang members fought, with the witcher eventually killing them all off just as Renfri showed up, revealing Stregobor didn't care if she killed off the whole village, he wasn't going to surrender to her. With no other option left, she forced Geralt to fight her, resulting in him killing her as well.
However, as the people who saw all the fighting didn't realize their lives had almost been in danger, they began to throw stones at Geralt, believing he'd attacked and killed people without cause. While Geralt didn't try to stop them the alderman stepped in to stop the throwing before asking Geralt to leave and not come back.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;The Heat of the Day is a quest which spans most of Chapter IV, in which Geralt initially meets a young bride to be, Alina, but then later must help her spirit find peace when she is tragically killed.
Walkthrough.
This quest finds Geralt in the midst of a village wedding. Is it not romantic? Alina is to marry Julian but her sister Celina is not very happy about it.
As the resolute girl puts it, Celina loves Julian, Julian loves Alina, Alina loves Adam and Adam loves Alina, but Alina loves Julians gold more, so she and Julian are to be married. Alina and Adam have been meeting secretly in the raspberry patch in the fields for who knows how long.
Jealousy.
Adam is aware of Celina's jealousy of Alina's upcoming marriage to Julian, a rich merchant from Kovir. She has made no secret of her feelings and seems to be willing to tell anyone about it, Geralt included. Alina cries on Celina's shoulder about her lover Adam. This only serves to reinforce the feelings that Celina has; namely, that Julian deserves better than to be made a fool of by her sister. The sisters argue and Celina pushes Alina who falls to her death. The actual site of their confrontation is not explicitly mentioned but there are enough clues to suggest that they were at the top of the tower of the ruined mill as this is one of the places that the midday bride appears.
Murder.
How exactly Adam comes to know of this event is unclear, but clearly he does find out and decides to avenge his beloved's death. He chases and then fatally stabs Celina. This stabbing is witnessed by Geralt who has been searching for the missing Alina in the fields at Julian's request.
A solution?
When Alina died, she became a noonwraith but did not accept her own death. He meets her in her new form at the raspberry patch and her lack of acceptance of her fate is clear. The witcher must seek help, in the form of information regarding such situations. His best sources are Dandelion, Berengar, Lady of the Lake, hermit in the fields or the local soothsayer (Abigail or the Murky Waters healer). From either of them, he learns that Alina had a very special mirror, one of Nehalenia's Mirrors. To break the curse, Geralt must find this mirror which is in five broken pieces scattered throughout the fields (carried by midday brides you find there during the day, one of them stands at the very top of the ruined mill, take the way at the barrels) and have the pieces reassembled by either:
Blacksmith: The village blacksmith, who is at his usual post outside his home in the village.
The Elven craftsman: The elven craftsman who can usually be found either fishing or tending the campfire near the elven cave by the lakeside.
Either way, this costs 100 .
More information.
Once the mirror has been reassembled, Geralt must show it to Alina. Seeing herself in the mirror is supposed to make her aware that she is dead and allow her spirit to move on, but it does not. Alvin (who by this time is dogging Geralt's every step, except in the village) mentions that speaking with someone who knows about legends and lore would help. Geralt must seek more advice on what to do from someone who knows. Who might know?
The witch:
Abigail: If Abigail is the healer, then she suggests that Dandelion could help out by writing something poetic
 Old Woman healer: If the old woman is the healer, she tells Geralt that he has innocent blood on his hands, so he can not help Alina. When pressed further, she tells Geralt that this innocent was Abigail, the soothsayer from the Outskirts. She goes on to say that "only the dead can hear the dead". She asks if he knows anyone who would be willing to make "the ultimate sacrifice"
Berengar: Geralt can also ask Berengar what to do, he offers a lot of information
Dandelion: Dandelion and Geralt can also come up with the solution while discussing Alina without Abigail's contribution
The Hermit: The Hermit also knows what to do about Alina and Celina
Lady of the Lake: At this point Geralt can tell Julian he does not know how to help Alina pass on. "At least if Abigail is the healer", Julian will suggest the The Lady of the Lake might know, and the Lady will tell Geralt to have a poem written.
Lifting curses.
Now to deal with Alina...
Dandelion: Geralt asks Dandelion to write a poem, and meet him in the raspberry patch at sundown (Dandelion runs up to the raspberry patch at a time between 18:00 and 19:30.). Dandelion then surprises Geralt and makes him participate in a spoken word poem for two voices.
Adam: Geralt must find Adam and tell him that only a poet or the dead can speak with Alina, and since Adam's no poet... he sacrifices himself and speaks to Alina.
In either scenario, Alina is finally convinced that she is dead. She then explains that she can not leave, despite knowing her fate. She must reconcile with her sister, Celina before she can move on.
Dandelion: Celina appears immediately to reconcile with her.
Adam: Geralt must wait until nightfall and find Celina in the fields.
Then Geralt has the opportunity to save Celina who has become a nightwraith because of her actions. To save her, follow her for a little bit and she will turn around and start a conversation. Geralt must give her the Wreath of Immortelles. After this, she walks a bit then sinks into the land, disappearing.

Phases.
Jealous Alina.
Alina is preparing for her wedding but fears her sister Celina is showing a bit too much interest in Alina's fiancé, Julian. I'm not sure how this happened, but I promised to help Alina. "I must go see Celina and Julian at the Inn."
Adam.
The plot thickens. I met a young man named Adam, who is nice enough but who is also thoroughly infatuated with Alina, secretly in love with her, actually. I'll ask Dandelion to talk some sense into the boy... "I should go see Dandelion at the inn."
Celina.
Another chapter of our pastoral tale unfolds. Jealous of her sister, Celina is actively pursuing Alina's fiancé. But Julian seems indifferent to Celina, so I doubt the bride-to-be has much to worry about. "I should see Alina and explain the situation."
Gossip.
Alina wasn't worried. As she states it, she trusts Julian, is sure of his feelings for her, and just wanted me to make sure he was all right. Women... "I should find something else to do before they implicate me in the wedding preparations."
A Premonition.
I've lived too much to ignore prophecies. Something wicked this way comes and Alvin foretold it. It will come soon, affecting those he holds dear. "I must find Julian and warn him."
The Missing Bride.
Alina, the village chief's daughter, has disappeared. They say she ventured into the fields to pick raspberries. I promised to find her. "I promised to look for Alina in the fields."
A Dream.
Alvin dreamt of Alina wandering through the fields in sunlight. Perhaps his words are a clue, the boy is clearly talented, sees things... I should look for Alina in daylight. "Alvin's dream suggests I should look for Alina in daytime."
The Noonwraith.
In the fields, I came upon a noonwraith that I think was Alina's ghost. The poor girl is dead. The noonwraith attacked me. Simply killing her will hardly put her to rest. I must talk to Julian. "I must tell Julian that Alina has turned into a noonwraith."
Murder.
I saw Adam murder Alina's sister, Celina. What drove him to it? Either way, Julian must learn of Alina's death. "Sad as it is, I must take the news of Alina's death to Julian."
Murder.
Celina killed her sister out of jealousy, and Adam slew Celina when he learned of his beloved's death. I must take this sad news to Julian. "I must tell Julian that Alina was killed by her sister, who is now dead as well."
Rat out Adam: I told Julian the whole truth. He is devastated and wants to have Adam arrested. I must find a way to free Alina's ghost. I should talk to someone who knows more about folk tales... "I must find a way to free Alina's ghost. I should speak to someone who has knowledge of curses."
Don't rat on Adam: I told Julian of Alina's fate, but said nothing of Adam's involvement. I must find a way to set Alina's ghost free. I should talk to someone who knows more about folk tales... "I must find a way to free Alina's ghost. I should speak with someone who has knowledge of curses."
The Mirror.
Alina had a Nehaleni's mirror, but she smashed it and its shards are scattered in the fields. I must find the pieces and reassemble the mirror. "I must find the shards of Alina's mirror in the fields."
The Craftsman.
I managed to find the mirror shards. Before presenting it to the noonwraith, I must have it repaired. I need to find a craftsman of some sort... "I must find a craftsman who can reassemble Alina's mirror." (2000 XP)
Elven craftsman: The elven craftsman agreed to reassemble the mirror for 100 orens. "I must remember to come back for the mirror later." (−100 )
Blacksmith: The blacksmith agreed to reassemble the mirror for 100 orens. "I must remember to come back for the mirror later." (−100 )
A Mirror for the Noonwraith.
I have Alina's mirror. Now I must find the noonwraith and see if the legends are true... "I must find the noonwraith, see if the legends about the mirror are true."
Further Investigation.
I gave the mirror to the noonwraith. She stopped attacking me and seems to remember who she used to be. It wasn't enough to put her to rest though. I need to investigate further. Aren't there any shortcuts to this folk tale? "I must continue looking for a way to put Alina's ghost to rest." (2000 XP)
Berengar: Berengar advised me to talk to the Lady of the Lake or to a diviner. He didn't have a solution for putting Alina's ghost to rest. "Berengar advised to talk to the Lady of the Lake or a diviner."
The Lady: The Lady of the Lake or some other wise being may know a way to free Alina's ghost. "The Lady of the Lake or a healer might help me banish Alina's ghost."
If Geralt left Abigail to be lynched:
The witch: The healer told me that I have spilled innocent blood. All I can do is find Adam and tell him that the dead can only hear the dead... "I must find Adam and tell him that the dead can only hear the dead."
The Lady: The Lady of the Lake told me that I have spilled innocent blood... All I can do is find Adam and tell him that the dead can only hear the dead... "I must go to Adam and tell him that the dead can only hear the dead."
If Geralt saved Abigail: I can help Alina by persuading Dandelion to sing her a ballad. That may help the unfortunate soul understand that she has been avenged. "I must persuade Dandelion to sing a ballad for Alina."
Arrested / Dandelion.
Adam:
Adam was arrested. I must convince Julian to let him go, otherwise Alina's ghost will never know rest. "I must convince Julian to release Adam."
Julian gave me the key to the house where Adam is being held. I must set him free. "I must free Adam."
Adam committed suicide. As a ghost, he was able to speak to Alina. The lovers finally found peace in death. It's time to find Julian, to conclude this tale. "It's time to see Julian and bring this tale to a close."
Julian kept his word and rewarded me for setting Alina's soul free. "I received my reward." (400 + 4000 XP)
A Reward.
Dandelion:
 Dandelion agreed to sing for the noonwraith until dusk. We're due to meet him in the evening by the raspberry patch in the fields. "I'm due to meet Dandelion in the evening by the raspberry patch."
Dandelion came through. Swayed by his song, the noonwraith lingered until dusk and learned that she has been avenged. This is all so... romantic. Julian will be glad. "My quest is completed. I should see Julian."
Julian kept his word and rewarded me for freeing Alina's soul. "Julian rewarded me for freeing Alina's soul." (400 + 6000 XP)

Sub-Pages:
General Information.
This page contains links to chapter-specific lists of items you should try to have in your inventory to complete all the quests in the game, whether or not you can get experience by doing them.
At the beginning of each chapter, before you do anything else, have a quick "whip-round" the area. Enter every single building you can enter and open every single container. Take as much stuff as you can carry and sell whatever you do not need (check the lists below for the stuff you need). While you are loaded up with potential gift items, try talking to as many NPCs as you can find, but always begin with the most minor character. Many of them will give you information in exchange for gifts or money. This helps shed inventory as well.
If you begin speaking to the main characters too soon, you may advance the plot prematurely and miss out on an opportunity to get something for free, or just get "some". It is always a good idea to keep a close eye on your journal entries. They really are useful and often tell you what to do next, particularly if you read each phase entry for each quest as you get them.

Dol Blathanna, translated from Elder Speech as the Valley of Flowers, was a kingdom and later an allod to Aedirn. It is bordered on the north by Kaedwen and the Blue Mountains to the east. It belonged to the elves for ages, until humans came and laid claim to the land about one hundred years ago, and the elves fled to the mountains.
History.
The region, while originally held by the Aen Seidhe, later fell to humans around the 1160s and, by the summer of 1267, was ruled over by a governor from Vengerberg. However, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard, looking to take out the northern mages to prevent a humiliating defeat like during the First Northern War, enlisted the help of Francesca Findabair, promising to give her Dol Blathanna and make her queen. After the Thanedd coup, while there were heavy casualties on all sides, Francesca was successful and, true to his word, the emperor made her queen, giving the elves a kingdom of their own, as he began his second full-scale invasion of the north.
Second Northern War.
However, this was short-lived. Following the Battle of Brenna in March of 1268, Nilfgaard once more suffered a devastating defeat and by early April, meetings were held to hash out the terms of peace. Meanwhile, Aedirn's king, Demavend III, acknowledged the new land, but as a duchy rather than a kingdom, and requested he be paid a tribute and that Dol Blathanna grant equal rights to humans and elves. Francesca, having heard all this upstairs with the other Lodge of Sorceresses' members, agreed to all of Demavend's conditions except paying tribute, making Dol Blathanna a freehold and lowering her status to that of duchess.
"The Witcher".
In Chapter III, Dandelion reminds Geralt about how he got his current lute, referring to the short story "The Edge of the World". In Chapter IV, Toruviel makes a similar reference. The glossary entry for elves also refers to Dol Blathanna, going as far as mentioning "Dana Méadbh" .
Dol Blathanna is a mentioned location in ". Iorveth claims that his people have no future there, despite being home for over 2000 elves for the last 5 years since its formation into an elven state. Only a little over a dozen elven children have been born so far in it, because most of its inhabitants are old and sterile, and Francesca Findabair is forced to abide by the Nilfgaardian emperor's rules, which ordered her to sacrifice the Scoia'tael to their execution at the hands of the other Northern monarchs. This is the main reason behind Iorveth's support for Saskia, the Virgin of Aedirn. He believes that the Pontar Valley might be the first suitable place for elves to flourish and not be persecuted.
A book available for purchase entitled "The Valley of the Flowers "provides this glossary entry in Geralt's journal.
Strangely enough, the game constantly refers to Dol Blathanna as an independent kingdom rather than an autonomous duchy in Aedirn.
"In the elven tongue Dol Blathanna means the Valley of the Flowers. Anyone who sees this land with their own eyes would admit to the aptness of this poetic name. Once the southeasternmost province of the Kingdom of Aedirn, it became the sole and sovereign realm of the Free Elves following the last war against Nilfgaard, when Emperor Emhyr var Emreis gave the elves these lands in return for their wartime service. Dol Blathanna is ruled by the elven sorceress Francesca Findabair, known also as Enid an Gleanna, the Daisy of the Valley. It remains a thorn in the side of neighboring realms, even though its queen has been forced to distance herself officially from the guerrilla war waged by the Scoia'tael."

Filavandrel aén Fidháil of the Silver Towers was a proud elf who lived in the Blue Mountains near Lower Posada.
Biography.
Early life and exile into the mountains.
Filavandrel was born in the influential elven family called the Feleaorns of the White Ships. When Aedirn conquered Dol Blathanna he was forced to escape into the mountains, where he became the leader of Free Elves.
Espionage in Lower Posada.
Unlike humans, elves didn't know agriculture, having found ways to have the land give them what they wanted before humans arrived. After humans took over though, the land changed and the elves could no longer get what they could from the lands and began to starve. Desperate for food, Filavandrel enlisted Torque's help in Lower Posada to steal food, seeds, and farming techniques from the bountiful village in hopes the elves could learn to farm in the mountains. However, one day he went to collect as usual when he and his band found that Torque was being chased by the witcher Geralt due to the sylvan's pranks irritating the villagers. Catching him by surprise, the elves captured the witcher and Dandelion. Geralt shared a few terse words with the proud elf, revealing Filavandrel was indeed too proud to cohabit with humans, even if it meant his group should starve and die in the mountains.
Seeing that there was no more point in conversing, Filavandrel ordered that Geralt and Dandelion be executed so to protect their deal with Torque but before it could be carried out the Queen of the Fields appeared, a revered figure among the elves. After communicating with the elves via telepathy, Filavandrel released Geralt and Dandelion before relenting and telling Geralt he was right but one day they'd make one last show of what the elves were made of, even if it meant their deaths, before leaving.
Francesca's advisor.
In late July 1267, after the breakout of the Second Northern War, he visited Francesca Findabair after she had been made queen of Dol Blathanna by Emperor Emhyr. At first he was upset they didn't get more land out of the deal, but after relenting that they barely had enough forces to protect the current borders of the valley, he proclaimed they should call their kind home and stop fighting like common bandits. However, Francesca revealed as part of the deal that made her queen, the emperor had demanded the Scoia'tael be left to fight and continue creating chaos for the Northern Kingdoms. However, she was also forced to officially renounce the guerrilla force and not offer them any aid, as was her agreement with Foltest and Henselt for their word to respect her rule. She then asked for his forgiveness and while Filavandrel did forgive her, he stated he didn't know if the other elves would.
Filavandrel is a leader in the Homecoming version.
"Scroll 1: Filavandrel nearly always insisted that he be addressed by his full name – Filavandrel aén Fidháil of the Silver Towers and House of Feleaorn of the White Ships. Perhaps his insistance says more about him that the list of titles itself."
"Scroll 2: Unlike most elves, Filavandrel never experienced life under human yoke. He never endured the humiliation of descrimination nor the fear of pogroms. He bore the proud expression of one who was never beaten down nor forced to bend knee."
"Scroll 3: Filavandrel did not fit the image of a stalwart warrior. He wore flowing robes and paid great attention to his appearance. And yet, sword in hand, he proved more dangerous than a raging fiend."
"Scroll 4: Filavandrel served as the the closest advisor and confidant to Francesca Findabair. He had great respect for the Queen of Dol Blathanna. She was the only individual with whom he was carefult to never put on airs."
"Chest 1: When the kingdom of elves fell to ruin, Filavandrel found refuge in the Blue Mountains, at the edge of the world, far from human settlements. There, surrounded with rubble and mountain pine, he longed for the day he could return to his beloved Valley of Flowers... And the luxuries with which it overflowed."
"Chest 2: The White Ships – words belonging to one of Filavandrel's many titles – are a reference to the vessels on which the elves first arrived to the Continent. Yes, yes... The noble Aen Seidhe were not this world's first inhabitants. A fact they are reluctant to admit... Likely because the cruelty they inflicted upon the land's indigenous races bears a striking resemblance to humans' callous treatment of elves several hundred years later."
"Chest 3: Filavandrel has many reasons to be proud. Among them is the fact that he once belonged to a small group who managed to best the legendary Geralt of Rivia in battle. He stood poised to kill the witcher, but his hand was stayed by the sudden appearance of Dana Méadbh, an elven goddess who abhors bloodshed. Had she not intervened, the fate of the world might have turned out rather differently..."

Enid an Gleanna (Elder Speech: "Daisy of the Valleys"), also known as Francesca Findabair, was an elven sorceress, and was the queen (later duchess) of the elves of Dol Blathanna, as decreed by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. She was also a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses after the fall of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.
Biography.
Aelirenn's rebellion.
When Francesca was younger she never considered the advantages of diplomacy. Believing direct action was the best way to ensure survival in regards to the human expansion. When speaking of the oppressive foreigners, she would often quote her father, Simlas Finn aep Dabairr, who had pure contempt for the ape-men. Francesca thus abhorred her father's decision to not meet them on the field of battle but rather sign a peace treaty with them. She saw this as a cowardly act and a spit in the face of all elves who wanted to be free of persecution. She beseeched her father to change his mind and fight the dh'oine. Simlas dismissed her pleas and forbade his daughter from getting involved. His words would fall on deaf ears. Inspired by the words of Aelirenn, Francesca defied her father's orders. She mustered her kin and joined the rebellion. She was lucky enough to survive the slaughter, yet her brash nature had cost her much. She had lost most of her companions, and the future potential of her race was all but obliterated. Her father, enraged by her betrayel disowned her and would never speak to her again.
Investigating the Elder Blood.
During King Goidemar of Temeria's time, her father had already disowned her. However, as he'd been a Sage, she knew quite a bit about the Elder Blood, so when a team of mages were sent to figure out which of the Houtborg triplets was the king's and which was Falka's, she was added to the group. They soon deduced that Adela was the infamous woman's child, but to avoid the execution of a 2 year old, the mages hid the truth, stating they'd need more time to figure it out and Goidemar never bothered to ask them later.
First Northern War and the Thanedd coup.
In 1263, during the First Northern War, Francesca fought alongside the Brotherhood of Sorcerers in the famous Battle of Sodden Hill, against the invading Nilfgaardian forces.
In 1267, Francesca was a member of the Chapter of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, making her one of the main leaders of the group. However, when Emperor Emhyr planned his second attempt to go to war with the North, he approached Francesca and offered her a deal: if she helped the other Nilfgaardian backers take out the opposing side during one of their conclaves, he'd give her the title of queen and be allowed to rule over Dol Blathanna, making it an elven state. She accepted the offer.
On June 30th, a conclave was called on Thanedd Island, she worked with Vilgefortz and the other Nilfgaard supporters to plan a coup where they'd take out the Northern supporters during the meeting, which was to be held in a tower that blocked magic of any kind. As part of her plan, she snuck in some Scoia'tael beneath the hollowed island under the premise she'd let them through when it came time to strike. The night before the meeting, during the banquet, she talked for a bit with Yennefer before her fellow sorceress introduced her partner, Geralt.
Sometime before dawn though, the Northern supporters, having learned of the betrayal and set their own plans into motion, struck first and arrested Francesca and the rest of the Nilfgaard supporters. When the arch-mistress, Tissaia de Vries, saw they'd handcuffed the elf, she demanded they release her until Philippa explained she was a traitor, having sold out to become a ruler of an independent state. When asked if this was true, Francesca merely responded in Elder Speech that she had nothing to say to humans. She was then led to Garstang with the rest of the Nilfgaard supporters to be tried for treason and summarily executed. However, the coup went awry and the Nilfgaard supporters were freed and they began to fight the others. To add to the chaos, Francesca then opened the cellar doors, letting in the Scoia'tael. Despite siding with Nilfgaard though, she didn't agree with some of them and, knowing the mage Rience had a personal vendetta against Yennefer, found the sorceress and used artefact compression on her to smuggle her off the island.
Queen of the Free Elves.
She managed to escape from Thanedd Island and, with the Brotherhood dissolved and the Northern rulers now distrustful of their mages, effectively completed her side of the deal. Emhyr, true to his word, made her Queen of Dol Blathanna but on the condition that she was to officially renounce the Scoia'tael and not help them in any way as he wanted them to continue causing problems for the Northern Kingdoms while he invaded. Now the queen of the Aen Seidhe, Filavandrel aén Fidháil met with her, stating they should now call all their fellow elves home until she explained the agreement that made her queen, effectively leaving the Scoia'tael stateless and without any support from their own kind.
On August 5th, shortly after she became queen, Francesca, along with other sorceresses, were sought out by Philippa Eilhart. She communicated via projection, and the sorceresses formed the Lodge, a secret society of sorceresses dedicated to ensuring the survival of magic. They agreed to meet later in person, and Francesca was permitted to bring two potential initiates with her to the next meeting.
Joining the Lodge.
After meeting with the emperor's head of military intelligence, Vattier de Rideaux, she met with the elven Sage, Ida Emean, who'd been hiding in the room from Vattier's sight. After discussing their expectations of the Lodge, Francesca finally decompressed Yennefer a month and a half after the Thanedd coup and explained to the dark haired sorceress she intended to have her attend the Lodge's next meeting in a few hours. However, knowing Yennefer was irritated at the queen and had her own plans in mind, Francesca threatened to compress her once more if she attempted to run. Despite this, Yennefer refused to give her word that she wouldn't try anything and the trio teleported to Montecalvo to meet the other sorceresses.
They soon arrived at the meeting and eventually Philippa revealed her plans: to have a kingdom ruled by magic and the perfect way to do this was to find the lost princess of Cintra, Ciri, and groom her to marry Tankred Thyssen, heir of Kovir and Poviss. This led to Francesca, along with Ida, to explain what they knew about the Elder Blood and how they believed Ciri was the sole inheritor of the powerful gene. However, it was quickly pointed out they'd only followed the official lines they knew of: they didn't take into consideration hidden affairs and other such situations that could compromise who was a carrier of it.
Throughout the rest of the year she attended several more meetings with the Lodge, in particular to hear how Fringilla Vigo was doing on her end to keep Geralt busy in Toussaint so the women could continue looking for Vilgefortz and Ciri. By early January of 1268, Fringilla revealed to them the location Geralt learned was Vilgefortz's hideout, Rhys-Rhun Castle and on the day of the attack, Francesca watched through a magical image as the women they sent to retrieve Vilgefortz and Ciri started their approach. However, they soon realized it'd been a false location; they'd underestimated Geralt and now he was too far away to get the truth out of him.
The war's end.
After the decisive Battle of Brenna that sent Nilfgaard retreating, all the kingdom's rulers met in Cintra to discuss the peace terms, with Francesca joining the Lodge in a room directly above the negotiations. When discussions turned to her and Dol Blathanna, King Demavend of Aedirn stated he would recognize its autonomy, not as a kingdom but as a duchy, and that it had to offer equal rights to both humans and elves while also paying him liege homage. For her part, Francesca agreed to all except paying him homage: instead, it'd be a freehold and she'd only give an oath of loyalty.
Several months later, on June 1, Francesca was once more in attendance with the rest of the Lodge, as Philippa had coerced Yennefer into having Ciri meet with them at last to try and use her for their, now slightly altered, plans. Despite this, Ciri proved she wasn't simply going to be ordered around and it was ultimately her decision that she had to think over. Before that, she needed to say goodbye to Geralt, having promised to meet him in several days. At this news, the women were apprehensive about letting Ciri run off to say goodbye and chose to vote on if they should let her go. Francesca chose to vote to let her, though she didn't give her reasons for why. However, while she was cordial enough to Ciri, she immediately showed hostility towards Yennefer, seeing the dark-haired sorceress' escape from the Lodge as her refusing to cooperate and therefore losing her rights to vote and must be sentenced appropriately at a later time. This sentencing never came to pass though, as Yennefer was caught in the Rivian Pogrom a few days later.
Later life.
It's unknown what exactly happened to Francesca after the Lodge's fall. Sometime by the late 1300s though, she and the rest of the elves were gone from the world, with not so much as a painting of her left behind, as all portraits of her were taken by the elves when they departed through a Door and out of this realm.
Appearance and personality.
Considered to be the most beautiful woman in the world by quite a margin, her blue, elven eyes were as inscrutable and hard as glass, constantly ringed with provocative elven make-up. She had long golden hair worn in majestic hairstyles and wore a grey-green dress decorated with lace, which rustled as she moved, to the banquet on Thanedd. For the first meeting of the Lodge, she wore a lavish dress the color of bull's blood and a ruby necklace.
"Though she does not appear in our story, the elf Francesca Findabair, known also as Enid an Gleanna or the Daisy of the Valley, certainly deserves mention. After the coup on Thanedd Island, during which she sided with the mages who had allied themselves with Nilfgaard, Francesca became the queen of Dol Blathanna, the state of the Free Elves created somewhat whimsically by Emperor Emhyr. Enid is widely considered the most beautiful woman in the world. This pureblood Aen Seidhe with dark gold hair and penetrating azure eyes is also a powerful sorceress, possessing a tremendous command of the famed elven magic."
Reward trees entries.
Francesca Findabair:
 "Scroll 1: Francesca Findabair, known also by her true name Enid an Gleanna, is widely regarded as the Continent's most beautiful woman – elf or otherwise. Yet she is also its saddest – all due to her dream fulfilled..."
 "Scroll 2: Francesca desired one thing above all – to reclaim Dol Blathanna, the Valley of Flowers, from human hands and rebuild the kingdom of elves. The North's war with Nilfgaard destroyed the old order and opened the door for her dream to be realized. The price to pay, however, was great indeed..."
 "Scroll 3: In order to regain Dol Blathanna, Francesca had no choice but to enter an alliance with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis of Nilfgaard. And when the time came for peace negotiations, she was to deliver captured Scoia'tael officers for punishment at the Imperial court."
 "Scroll 4: Francesca had no doubt she made the right decision – dozens of soldiers in exchange for the fate of her people. The sheer number of lives at stake suggest she made the humane choice, yet solace cannot always be found in cold calculation."
 "Chest 1: According to the provisions of the Cintrian peace agreement, sovereignty of Dol Blathanna would fall to the elves. However, the treaty did not specify in what condition. With this loophole kept well in mind, all those fleeing the valley carried what they could and burned the rest. In place of her beloved Valley of Flowers, Francesca Findabair inherited a Valley of Ashes."
 "Chest 2: Francesca sought to return the Valley of Flowers to its former glory, though her aim would prove far more difficult than she had anticipated. Razed palaces can be rebuilt, scorched gardens can be recultivated. Yet after years of exile, the elves had forgotten many of their time-honored traditions and customs, instead soaking in human culture. It seemed Dol Blathanna would never regain its former identity."
 "Chest 3: Francesca realized that one false move could once again bring ruin upon the Valley of Flowers. Thus, she patiently tolerated her neighbors' incessant provocation. However, were any to cross the border into Dol Blathanna, Francesca would stop at nothing to defend her realm and subjects."
Duchess of Dol Blathanna:
"Scroll 1: There was a time in Francesca Findabair's life when she did not even remotely consider the advantages of diplomatic tact. She believed direct action was the best way to ensure survival, especially when regarding humans⁠—a race renowned for their lustful expanse and underhanded methods."
"Scroll 2: When speaking of these oppressive foreigners, she frequently quoted her father, the elven Sage Simlas Finn aep Dabairr, regurgitating the words she had often heard during childhood. 'Only those lacking sense,' her father would spit with pure contempt, 'would trust the word of a dh'oine."
"Scroll 3: Yet, her father had long since changed his tune regarding the humans. Or, at least, altered his pitch. For he had used a magical orb of insight to witness shimmers of the future, and saw that war with the ape-men would only lead to the annihilation of elves."
"Scroll 4: Not wanting to lead his kind to their deaths, Simlas swallowed his pride and entered a peace treaty with the humans, hoping the act would save the elves from massacre. Unfortunately, he could not halt the incoming destruction, as forces both within and without conspired against him. And one such force bore the face of his unruly daughter."
"Chest 1: Francesca abhorred her father's reluctance to meet the dh'oine on the field of battle. She saw his isolation from external affairs as a cowardly act, and one that spat in the face of all elves wishing to live free from persecution. But despite her incessant beseeching, Simlas refused to send his subjects to their slaughter and forbid his daughter from getting involved. Alas, his words fell on deaf ears. Inspired by the infectious rhetoric of the warrior elf Aelirenn, Francesca defied her father's orders, mustered her kin, and joined the rebellion."
"Chest 2: Simlas' forlorn prophecy came to be. The rebellion was short-lived, and in the wake of human conquest lay a generation of elves thoroughly suppressed and mercilessly slaughtered. Francesca was lucky enough to survive the doomed venture, yet her brash nature had cost her much. Most of her companions were dead, and the future potential of her race all but obliterated. In addition, her father, enraged by her betrayal, disowned her, vowing that words would never break between them again⁠—a promise he would keep until the end of his days."
"Chest 3: There was a time when Francesca's decisions were guided by fiery impulse, governed by a desire to act swiftly in place of calculated tact. A lifetime of mistakes, however, can work wonders in cooling one's hot-headedness, and slowly but surely, she became the dispassionate tactician her father had once wished her to be. But even he would recoil in horror to witness the pact she later made with the Nilfgaardian Emperor."

Stregobor was a Kovirian wizard and a master illusionist, as well as a staunch believer in "the Curse of the Black Sun".
Biography.
Stregobor had lived in Kovir for most of his life, serving King Idi along with the mage Zavist. At one point the witcher Geralt completed a contract by killing an amphisboena for the king, but instead of paying the witcher, Stregobor and Zavist convinced Idi that Geralt was a charlatan and shouldn't be paid. On top of that, Idi then gave Geralt barely enough time to leave the kingdom.
Being a strong believer in the Curse of the Black Sun, he also helped with the Council's efforts in trying to learn more about the afflicted girls, going as far as doing autopsies and even a vivisection on one, believing he was acting in the people's defense because "the mutant girls would have drowned entire countries in blood." However, it proved difficult in picking the girls out, so the mages stopped killing the girls and started to lock them up in towers.
Meeting Renfri.
Some time later, the Council sent Stregobor to Creyden because of Queen Aridea's suspicions concerning her stepdaughter, Renfri, who'd been born during an eclipse. Reportedly using Nehalenia's Mirror, the queen learned she and many others would die at the hands of her stepdaughter. Stregobor showed up and spied on the young Renfri and, after conducting some tests, confirmed the child was a mutant. While he wanted to isolate the girl, Aridea wanted to kill her and sent the princess into the woods with a thug hired to kill her. Instead, the thug raped Renfri, who took advantage of him being occupied and stabbed her brooch pin through his ear and into his brain, killing him, before running away.
Stregobor soon left but four years later Aridea sent word that she'd tracked Renfri, now known as Shrike, to Mahakam. The queen then summoned him to return to Creyden, but by the time he arrived, Aridea had been poisoned and subsequently died. While the general rumor was that her husband, Fredefalk, did it, Stregobor believed it was the work of Renfri.
Later on, Stregobor was in Mahakam when Renfri crossed paths with him and, remembering his part back in Creyden, moved to attack the sorcerer but he uttered a spell at the last minute, turning her into a crystal slab, which he then tossed into a mine and proceeded to cave in, burying her. Despite this, Renfri was later freed by a prince from a distant kingdom and set out to assassinate Stregobor.
On the run.
Stregobor went back to Kovir but Renfri found him and, after three assassination attempts there, he fled to the Pontar Valley, then to Angren, but each time she found him. He finally hid in Arcsea, in the town of Blaviken, and took on the name Master Irion, the former owner of the tower he now took residence in. Here, he lived in peace for about a year, helping the locals occasionally, until Renfri found him once more.
Around the same time, Geralt arrived in town on unrelated business and, despite Geralt's obvious dislike of the sorcerer from their past relations, Stregobor still asked Geralt to kill Renfri, proclaiming it was "the lesser evil". However, Geralt refused to do so, believing Renfri had her reasons and he didn't want to pick sides.
The next day, Renfri appeared at the sorcerer's impenetrable tower, giving him an ultimatum: come out voluntarily to his death or she and her gang would start killing all the market goers in town. However, he refused, stating they could kill all of Blaviken and its neighboring towns and he still wouldn't come out.
Renfri then returned to the marketplace where Geralt had just finished killing off her gang and the two sparred before Geralt killed the princess. Having seen the fight from his crystal ball, Stregobor then emerged from his tower and attempted to collect the body to do an autopsy on, but Geralt threatened to kill him if he touched her. With that, Stregobor then returned to Kovir.
"Season of Magic: Stregobor" reward tree.
This event allows to unlock the lore on Stregobor and his avatar.
"Scroll 1: Stregobor looked like a wizard plucked straight out of a fairy tale: gray, bearded, hunched, a long staff in hand, and always wearing dark, trailing robes with wide sleeves. One could say: a dignified appearance indeed. But in reality, no self-respecting sorcerer would be caught alive wearing such clothes and accessories. Except for Stregobor, of course."
"Scroll 2: Stregobor was widely renowned for his incredibly realistic illusions. The flowers he conjured smelled sweet, apples could be eaten, bees stung painfully, and beautiful girls did absolutely everything that their creator wanted. It has been said that this last detail was the main motivator for Stregobor's research into illusions. But the sorcerer himself strongly denied such allegations."
"Scroll 3: Illusions weren't Stregobor's only strength. He was also able to calm or create storms, precisely controlling the winds or clouds. However, his greatest passion was poured into researching the Curse of the Black Sun."
"Scroll 4: The Brotherhood of Sorcerers, largely due to Stregobor's urging, imprisoned in towers and - more or less intentionally - killed dozens of young girls born from royal families. According to the prophecies, exactly sixty princesses were supposed to be possessed by demons, cursed and tainted by the Black Sun. It was written that they will "fill the river valleys with blood". Written - but not proven. Stregobor's vials were ultimately the only thing to be filled with blood."
"Chest: The Brotherhood of Sorcerers seized most of the princesses allegedly affected by the Curse of the Black Sun. Stregobor personally performed post-mortem examinations on many, with most deaths during the experiments... None of those experiments brought the expected results. While the princesses had some mutations in their bodies, Stregobor found nothing conclusively proving his claims: they bled like a human, suffered like a human, and died just like a human would.Yet one escaped his grasp. Renfri, princess of Creyden, also known as the Shrike. For years she was begging, lying, stealing, and even selling herself, just to survive. When she finally grew stronger and had gathered her own group of highwaymen, Renfri began to seek revenge at all costs... In the end, she was prepared to pay the highest price. In order to get her hands on Stregobor, she was ready to slaughter a whole city. A white-haired witcher prevented this from happening, killing not only Renfri, but every member of the Shrike's crew. Ironically, this act of valiance only netted him the moniker: the Butcher of Blaviken.Meanwhile, Stregobor escaped - free of guilt and punishment."

Circle of Elements

A Circle of Elements or Elemental Circle (not to be confused with a Place of Power) is a place where magic is strong, enough for people to have erected monuments.
Mages can draw power from Circles of Elements, and witchers can learn new Signs, as well as getting a momentary boost for the spells they already know. These are likely manifestations of intersections.

During quest The Final Trial happening near Kaer Morhen after more witty banter, and heading south up the rough trail to the ancient Circle of Elements, you reach your destination.
Soak in the view, then listen and follow Lambert's instructions: Move to each of the unlit torches, and use Igni to quickly light them. Then place the phylactery on the smooth stone altar. You wait, and Lambert asks how you dealt with trolls during your own trial. Answer how you wish.

Hildegard Zollstock

Hildegard Zollstock was a widow living in the Temple Quarter. Her husband died roughly a month before 1270. She can be found walking on the Graveyard Alley, or standing outside the cemetery's gate around noon. It seemed that her deceased counterpart was not happy merely enjoying the great beyond. He was intent on spreading malicious lies about the poor woman.

Place of Power

See: Intersection
"The Witcher".
In "The Witcher", Places of Power are (nearly) invisible spots where magic is concentrated. They are "not" Circles of Elements. Unlike those, Places of Power are practically invisible until Geralt approaches them. There is an audible roaring sound when he gets close enough to them which is also a clue to finding them. And finally, if the witcher medallion is set to detect magic, it will vibrate near the Places of Power.
 These places of power are indicated on maps with a blue dot.
Rituals:.
In these spots, depending on how talents have been allocated, Geralt can perform different rituals.
Geralt can perform the Ritual of Magic by default. The other two rituals require higher level Intelligence upgrades before they can be performed.
Mechanics:.
There are Places of power in all locations of the game, except Kaer Morhen keep, in the Prologue.
".
In the second game there are Circles of Power, which have similar effects.
In the third game places of power return and will grant Geralt of Rivia a Skill Point if their locations are found and then activated. It is important to find these as there are a limited number of Skill Points in the game. Each Place of Power is tied to one of the 5 Signs and will increase that Sign's intensity when drawn from.

Aridea was Prince Fredefalk of Creyden's second wife and stepmother to Renfri Vellga.
Biography.
"Important note:" "As the only information on Aridea is secondhand through two people who had very different opinions regarding her, it's hard to know what's really true and what's biased information."
It's unknown what happened to Prince Fredefalk's first wife (the mother of Renfri) but eventually the prince met Aridea and the two enter a romantic relationship before marrying and having children together. Described by Stregobor as a wise, educated woman, Aridea also possessed one of Nehalenia's Mirrors, though it was claimed instead of using it for vain questions, Aridea was interested in her country's fate. She was thus informed that she and a great number of other people would die a horrible death at the hands of Fredefalk's beloved firstborn daughter, Renfri, and made sure this news reached the Council, who in turn sent Stregobor to investigate.
After spying on Aridea's stepdaughter, he claimed she'd tortured several creatures, severely harmed a servant and, after he performed a few curses, confirmed Renfri was a mutant as she'd been born during an eclipse. He then reported this to Aridea as he believed she was smart and Fredefalk wouldn't listen because he adored his daughter. With this, the queen then decided to take matters into her own hands and hired a thug to take Renfri out into the forest and kill her. However, the thug decided he'd try to rape the girl instead, allowing Renfri to kill him with her brooch while he was occupied, before running away.
Four years later, Aridea sent word to Stregobor that she'd tracked down Renfri in Mahakam. Still intent on getting rid of her stepdaughter, Aridea also sent numerous assassins after the princess, but none of them ever returned. She then summoned for Stregobor but by the time the sorcerer arrived in Creyden, Aridea had been killed by a poison.

Nonhuman

Nonhuman, or the neutral yet polysemantic humanoid, are terms referring to cultured races similar to humans in outward appearance. Although the nonhumans had conflicts with one another, they mostly found their place on the Elder Races-dominated Continent until being pushed into ravines, high mountains, and primeval forests by burgeoning mankind. Some, like werebbubbs, had almost gone extinct as a result.
Despite virtually every Nordling having a dash of Aen Seidhe blood in their veins by 1267, xenophobia towards nonhumans stood behind many , pogroms, and general tension. For example, knights born as both illegitimate and from human-nonhuman unions were entitled to heraldry but couldn't be considered "true nobles" and were prohibited from crossing city gates after dusk. The picky saw even a quarter-elf as inferior.
The humanoid label is also used by the witchers for enemies with composition akin to humans, though they technically aren't monsters just as animal beasts. Classification gets murkier in ogroids such as trolls, who evolved from deadly monsters into semi-intelligent, helpful neighbors due to contact with sapient races.

Journal entry.
The hierophant asks Geralt to get a psilocybe mushroom so he can lure the remaining Salamandra into an ambush. Apparently this would make fisstech even more powerful than it is, so it makes for a very good bait for the planned surprise attack. This must be the distilled ingredient.
This item is found in the cave in the Swamp. It is also described in a journal entry. The mushroom itself — — is a "concrete" game item.

The Skellige Islanders refer to this mushroom as "Mardroeme". It is used to induce hallucinations and is part of the formula deployed to transform the berserkers.

Battle of Brenna

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
The Battle of Brenna is one of the most famous battles of the Second Nilfgaard War. It was the turning point for the Northern Kingdoms who, up until that point, had been losing rather badly to the invading Nilfgaardian Empire and its allies. The Northern victory at Brenna paved the way to the eventual Peace of Cintra to be signed the following month.

Summary of battle.
For their initial incursion, Nilfgaard sent the heavily armed Alba Division. After some success on the battlefield, Alba had reached the center of the Temerian Army and was stuck there. The Nilfgaardian soldiers' heavy armour restricted their movements making them easy targets for the pikes and spears of the Temerians. Ultimately the Temerian infantry prevailed.
Menno Coehoorn responded to this attack by bringing in his own troops (the Deithwen cavalry and a heavy battalion, Ard Feainn) and assaulted the enemy lines above Golden Pond, where the troops from Brugge had made their stand. The troops from Brugge managed to fend off the Nilfgaardians for a while, but their morale was low and their weapons inferior. Fortunately the Free Company arrived with much needed help, and the enemy troops were stopped, but many men were lost on both sides.
Nevertheless, Nilfgaard was still close to breaking through to the front, so the Free Company and troops from Mahakam joined the fray and took on Ard Feainn, managing to push them back. Seeing this, Field marshal Coehoorn sent in the elven Vrihedd brigade, to try and divide the Temerian and Redanian armies. Their hope was to break through to the front before the dwarves and other reinforcements arrived to bolster the nordlings. They managed to do that, and the Nordling army panicked.
In response, King Foltest and John Natalis sent in Bronibor's and Blenckert's troops from Redania.
Field marshal Coehoorn gathered his remaining troops (the Nauzicaa and 7th Daerlan brigades) and attacked the location where the elves were. He didn't count on Bronibor's infantry fighting so bravely against a larger foe. On the left flank, Nilfgaard's army was in ruins, troops fighting at the center front were losing to the Nordling armies. Nauzicaa was surrounded and destroyed and 7th Daerlan brigade were defeated by PFI and by the Free Company. The entire Nilfgaardian Army was either defeated or surrounded. Menno Coehoorn was killed trying to escape from battle by Zoltan Chivay's company.

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Anatomy of a Crime is a quest which Geralt receives from Raymond Maarloeve in Chapter II as part of his investigation into the Salamandra organization in Vizima and his quest to find and neutralize its leader, Azar Javed.
Walkthrough.
After some time has passed since the detective is attacked by Salamandra assassins, Raymond decides to resurface by sending a messager boy to Geralt, inviting him to a meeting at the detective's place. During the meeting, Raymond tells the witcher that the "Crown Witness" has died and it's very likely that he's been murdered. An autopsy, if performed successfully, could pinpoint the potential murderer, who definitely commited the act to cover for Salamandra.
Preparations.
Since Geralt has never done an autopsy, the witcher turned to Shani asking for help. The red headed medic agreed and told Geralt to gather as much information as possible to help the autopsy. This essentially boils down to two things:
Geralt can read about them in the books "Forensic Medicine" and "Zerrikanian Insects and Other Vermin", which are sold by the Antiquary on Merchant Street. You can purchase "Forensic Medicine" from Thaler as well.
Alternatively, the witcher can obtain this information by simply talking to people. For Medical Science, talk to the gravedigger about the prisoner's corpse ("A prisoner died recently. Is he in the cemetery already?"). For Zerrikania, ask the Gardener about his mercenary days with a gift of food.
Regardless of the amount of information gathered, Geralt still has to get the body of the crown witness out of the cemetery and to St. Lebioda's Hospital so that he and Shani can perform an autopsy undisturbed. To do so, the witcher will have to get a bottle of "Dwarven spirit"(or "Mahakaman mead") for the gravedigger.
Once everything is settled, Geralt will meet Shani in the Hospital at midnight, starting the autopsy.
The Autopsy.
The course of the autopsy can vary greatly, depending on whether Geralt has learned a critical knowledge that changes the entire purpose of the autopsy among other things:
"Major Spoiler:" The detective Raymond's identity has been assumed by Azar Javed!
For simplicity and accuracy, this critical knowledge will be refered to as the "Grand Truth" from this point.
If Geralt is still kept in the dark by now, the autopsy can end up implicating any one of the three as the murderer: Kalkstein, Ramsmeat or Azar Javed, providing a chance at beating Azar in his own game and uncovering the "Grand Truth".
For Kalkstein or Ramsmeat, no information is required to implicate one of them as the murderer, simply keep leaning towards one of them and Geralt will eventually make up his mind.
It's much harder to expose Azar's scheme however. For one, Geralt will need to gather both of the information about the autopsy: Medical Science and Zerrikania. Additionally, after the two has agreed that the body has clearly been gnawed at by necrophages post mortem, Geralt will also need to remain prudent and skeptical throughout the autopsy by choosing the following dialogue option:
If Geralt has learned the "Grand Truth" beforehand, the objective of the autopsy shifts from identifying the murderer to confirming the murderer and uncovering his method of killing. In this case, all dialogue options leading the autopsy to a misguided direction are removed and Geralt automatically figures out the murderer's method. No information is required either.
The quest ends alongside the completion of the autopsy. Geralt must now get back to the detective to share his newest findings, or does he now?
Phases.
Autopsy.
I have never done an autopsy before. Well, there always has to be the first time for everything. I have to make an appointment with Shani and get the corpse from the gravedigger. "I have to make an appointment with Shani and get the corpse from the gravedigger." (−200 )
Know Your Enemy.
"This becomes the active phase whenever Geralt has learned the "Grand Truth". This is the earliest position it can be."
I know Azar is masquerading as Raymond - I have proof. I should go ahead with the autopsy - not to learn the murderer's identity, but to discover his methods. "The autopsy will reveal Azar's methods."
The Corpse.
"This only appears if you ask the gravedigger whether the body has been delivered to the cemetery."
The corpse hasn't been delivered to the graveyard yet, but at least I learned something of interest. "I should talk to Shani."
Shani.
"This only appears if you ask Shani about the autopsy in the Hospital."
I have to call on Shani at her house - we won't be able to talk about the autopsy in the hospital. We need to stay low with this. "I need to go to Shani's house and talk to her about the autopsy."
Preparations for the Autopsy.
I'll collect the corpse from the gravedigger. It should take some time, so in the meantime I'll prepare for the autopsy. I should talk to people who have conducted investigations, or read some books. "While I'm waiting for the corpse, I should talk to someone who have conducted such an investigation or read some books about it."
The Bribe.
The gravedigger won't let me get the corpse. A bottle of vodka should convince him, I reckon. "I should bring the gravedigger some liquor - best if it's dwarven. "
The Autopsy.
Everything's ready. We're starting at the hospital at midnight. "I have to come to the hospital at midnight." (500 XP)
Ramsmeat / Kalkstein / Azar Javed.
Autopsy implicates Ramsmeat:
The autopsy proves Ramsmeat was behind the murder. That suggests the bandits from Vizima co-operate with the Salamanders. "The autopsy proves beyond doubt that Ramsmeat was behind the murder." (1500 XP)
Autopsy implicates Kalkstein:
The autopsy showed Kalkstein was the murderer. It would be hard to find a better proof of his working for Azar. "The autopsy proved Kalkstein was the murderer." (2000 XP)
Autopsy implicates Azar Javed as a surprise:
The autopsy results are astonishing - Azar is the murderer. The son of a bitch disguised himself as Raymond, almost fooled me! "The autopsy results are surprising - Azar is the murderer." (2500 XP)
Autopsy implicates Azar Javed as expected:
The results of the autopsy confirmed my suspicions - Azar is a cruel and ruthless man. There are many ways to get rid of a witness; he chose the most malicious. I must remember that and I should not underestimate him. "I must not underestimate Azar - the autopsy showed he'll stop at nothing." (2500 XP)
Autopsy.
"This only appears if the quest failed."
Given recent developments, proceeding with the autopsy no longer makes sense. I basically know all I need. "I no longer need to do the autopsy."

Disenchanting a Striga

Disenchanting a Striga is a book in "The Witcher". It tells the story of the disenchantment of Princess Adda, who had been turned into a striga.
Disenchanting a Striga"Anonymous"
""The witcher then said to King Foltest: "Pay me, Sire, and I will find your daughter in the dark tomb. I will restore her human form if I can, and if I cannot then I will not hesitate to kill the princess.""
"The king understood this was his only chance and so placed his daughter's fate in the witcher's hands."
"The conjurer struggled with the striga for hours. He warded her off with silver and magic arts. He grappled with the beast and did not let her wound him, but avoided causing serious harm to her as well."
"Finally, he locked himself in the crypt, sealed the entrance with magic and waited until dawn."
"Witchers possess great knowledge about monsters and know that the rooster's morning call is enough to disenchant a cursed creature.""

Shadow People, or the story of His Majesty's Secret Service

Shadow People, or the story of His Majesty's Secret Service is a missing work penned by Oribasius Giafranco Paolo Reuven. It is said to describe the unrelenting efforts of Sigismund Dijkstra, head of the Redanian Secret Service during the Second Nilfgaard War with Nilfgaard.

Shadow People, or the story of His Majesty's Secret Service"by Oribasius Giafranco Paolo Reuven"
""Redania's political situation was best grasped by Sigismund Dijkstra, who could accurately foresee the future and would have assessed present events level-headedly."
"Dijkstra knew the kings of the North were weak and that actual power rested with the sorceresses. He assumed that a counterbalance for their magic could only be provided by a strong religious cult offering an ideology that would appeal to the masses and possessing real armed forces."
"The chief of Redanian intelligence supported the newly-formed Order of the Flaming Rose, but disagreed with the concept of establishing its main commandery within Redanian territory. Dijikstra is reported to have said: "It's good to have fanatics and sorceress-scarers on one's side, but it's even better when they live beyond one's borders."
"Fundamentalists always cause trouble, so it's best to transfer this trouble to somebody else. Like the Temerians, for instance. And if we need fanatics, if we need to unleash them against the sorceresses or Nilfgaard, we'll just whistle. They will not be far — just beyond the border." Time will tell how much truth there was in these words.""

<doc id="4015" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4015" title="Sign">
Sign

The witchers adapted the spell, making use of the fact that it does not require knowledge of a magical formula—concentration and the gesture are enough. That's why they call it a Sign.- Yennefer discussing signs with Ciri,  pg. 309, "Blood of Elves" (U.S. edition)Though they are not warrior mages who employ powerful magic, witchers can cast simple magic spells that can prove effective when used properly. Witchers call these spells signs and usually use them against monsters, though they also have non-combat applications. Because of the signs, witchers prefer single-handed weaponry since it leaves their other hand free to cast. Some of the signs are cast by arranging the fingers in specific way, while the others have to be drawn on a solid surface.
It is possible to make the sign more powerful by enforcing it with the spell. Geralt utilised this method at least once, during his fight with Vereena.
Known signs.
"For the full list of known signs, see ."
"The Witcher".
Through the use of the Circle of Elements, five of the signs become available over the course of the original game:
The Heliotrop sign was not included in the original game.
Sign modifiers.
Geralt's skill at using these signs is governed by the allocation of talents as he levels up. This can affect the following:
Cost of casting.
The cost of casting a sign is measured in endurance. Casting signs uses up endurance and proficiency at casting signs reduces the amount of endurance required.
Notes.
Unlike the original game, Geralt is not required to re-acquire his knowledge of signs in ". His knowledge of them is intact.
Mechanics.
Press key to select one of five icons on the left of the circle menu. Then pressto cast it. The sign will strike the nearest opponent in front of Geralt. When you enhance a sign spending talent points in the relative magic skills, it will hit more enemies at once with an area effect.
Casting cost.
Every time you cast a sign it consumes some vigor. The vigor bar is on the top left corner of the screen, under the wolf head medallion and the red bar of vitality. When the vigor bar is zero, Geralt is not able to cast any sign or parry an opponent's hit. However some potions, using dedicated Places of Power or enhancing some specific skills like Vigor Regeneration and Fortitude, can increase the vigor regeneration in and out of combat.
Sign intensity and duration.
The intensity and duration of signs mostly depend on the level of the magic skills. Also there are some items, some dedicated Places of Power, and potions that can enhance signs damage or increase their intensity:
Armors
Silver swords
Enhancements
Potions
Magic tree skills
Aard
Igni
Yrden
Quen
Axii
In "Witcher 3" all signs from the previous game make a return, however, each sign can be upgraded and possess an alternative form for the player to employ.

Milo Vanderbeck (d. 1269), also known as Rusty, was a halfling and Shani's mentor and friend. She worked beside him in the field hospital during the Battle of Brenna, alongside Marti Södergren and Iola the Second.
Originally, Milo thought Shani would collapse from exhaustion or faint at the gruesome operations, but she, along with the others, proved herself quite capable. Milo also showed he was a true doctor in the sense he patched anyone up on his table, whether they were an enemy soldier, peasant, elf, or otherwise. He further showed this when one knight tried to force Rusty to look at the wounded Count Daniel Etcheverry ahead of everyone else, but Milo calmly told the knight the count would have to wait his turn like the rest.
A year later, in 1269, he was in Maribor with Iola, tending to the sick who'd come down with the Catriona plague, despite there being no cure. Unfortunately for them both, they contracted the disease and died soon after.
Before dying, Rusty discovered that certain plants like the celandine decelerated the symptoms of the plague in those affected. This knowledge was then used in St. Lebioda's Hospital to treat the infected.

Vimme Vivaldi was a dwarven banker who resided in Novigrad, and a friend of the halfling Dainty Biberveldt.
"The Witcher".
Golan Vivaldi says Vimme is his cousin. He also mentions that Vimme "once met a witcher, a debt collector, apparently".
Vimme runs the Vivaldi Bank's branch situated in Novigrad's Hierarch Square. Geralt can use services to exchange currencies or borrow a loan. The dwarf is also an experienced gwent player, with an enviable deck which includes the "Vesemir" card.
 "The dwarves have been in the banking business since the legendary King Desmond of Temeria was just a snot-nosed brat in short trousers asking for me "yam" with his "bwed." Since then, the prominent dwarven banking families – the Giancardis, the Vivaldis and the Cianfanellis – have only expanded their services, establishing branches in all the larger cities of the North."
 "Vimme Vivaldi carried the torch of this venerable tradition into modern times, growing the Novigrad branch of his family's bank until it was the largest in the city. Geralt and I met him over a dozen years before our story begins and had always appreciated his honesty and acumen."
 "The latter he gave further proof of during the time in which our story takes place, for his bank remained profitable even in the face of growing nonhuman oppression."

Druid

"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
Druids are scholars of the forest, and their understanding of nature's workings is deep. They take in wild animals and help them heal wounds and sickness, and also take in anything humans injured or orphaned. The druids' grove, grown around the Tree of Life, is a sanctuary where no blood is spilled. Leaders of druid circles are known as hierophants, if they are male, and flaminikas, if they are female.
History.
Early Druids.
Right after the Conjunction of the Spheres some members of the early humans, the Dauk and Wozgor, became the first Druids. They would guide small communities through the Monster infested world and sheperded the natural world. At the great oaks where they would convene they build stone altars and arches and adorned them with writing and sigils. What ultimately happend to these Druids is unkown.
Landing of the Exiles.
When the first Nordlings arrived on the Continent they discovered the stone altars left by the early Druids. As they faced the same dangers as the early humans some Nordlings became Druids. These Druids would also try to strike a balance between protecting nature and their fellow humans. Thus they would take on roles such as advisor to a chieftain, sage or healer of the ill.
Decline.
As humans spread and build cities, farms, mines and more the role of Druids changed. Their pleas to life in harmony with nature were now seen as archaic and would slow the progress of society. Over time the Druids place in society was taken over by Mages, as they were more pragmatic.
By the beginning of the 13th century Druids had been pushed out, deep into the wilds. The only place where Druids kept their influence was in Skellige, where they still had the ears of the rulers. On the rest of the continent the circles lacked the influence and means to do anything about mages, merchants and kings despoiling nature. Relegated to their circles they care for the surrounding wildlife and any human or Nonhuman that requires aid.
"The Witcher".
The druids can be found in the druids' grove in the swamp, just north of the lumberjacks' glade in Chapters II and III. In Chapter V, some of them have fled to the swamp cemetery, where the Green March preparations appear to be in full force in the druids' cave.
The druids are caring individuals and have no wish to see anyone or anything suffer. A nice side benefit of this philosophy is that anyone in their immediate vicinity who needs it receives free healing.
Elder druid
The Elder druid is alone among the druids willing to sell and buy things. He is a source of knowledge and the one Geralt is supposed to speak with, mostly, but not exclusively.
Hierophant
The Hierophant is a professional Dice player who has a liking for psilocybe. He can be found in the druids' grove in the swamp during Chapter III.
Hermit
The Hermit is also a druid and professional Dice player but he is more interested in serving the Lady of the Lake. He can be found in the fields during Chapter IV.
The Green March
The Green March is a peaceful attempt by the druids and like-minded people to draw attention to the preservation of nature.
Several druids can be met in the Skellige Islands. The most notable and leader of the druids is Mousesack. Also worthy note is Gremist, the master alchemist in "The Witcher 3".
The Ghost in the Tree claims to have once been a druidess who had kept watch over the Velen grove until the Crones murdered her and imprisoned her ghost in the tree. Geralt can either let her free or kill her.

Naiad

Naiads, more commonly known as rusalki, are the nymphs of lakes and rivers. Like their wood cousins, dryads, they are exclusively female and sometimes said to kidnap human girls to transform them into more nymphs, though they prefer more traditional ways of reproduction.
History.
According to the dwarves, nymphs appeared in the world centuries before the arrival of civilized races, possibly among the first living species to appear on the planet. Dwarves and naiads shared mutual hatred towards each other: naiads despised the dwarves for polluting the rivers, while dwarves perceived the naiads as savage barbarians. Elves were far more acceptable for naiad ideology and the naiads eventually adopted dialects of Elder Speech as their spoken language.
There is not much information on their initial contacts with humans. When the Nordlings arrived they might originally perceive naiads as monsters or demons, not unlike the other nymphs who blocked their industrial and territorial expansion. It is, however, possible that the first contacts were more friendly due to non-aggressive stance of the rusalki and they started to hunt them only after the first handsome boys were inadvertently drowned during too extatic encounters. The Rangers were particularly known to hunt and hang the rusalki alongside other forest creatures of the Northern Realms.
South to the Sea of Gales, a number of inhabitants of Irin and nearby areas were engaged in the procedure of "nymph trafficking". So-called nymph-hunters used to travel on ships down to the Daithi and the Yarra where they abducted rusalki to sell them to brothels and aquaria of the city's bourgeoisie. The local naiads, inspired by human woman Bevin Lagerfeld who was once trapped with them, eventually took a more militaristic approach to life together with a group of Wood Elves led by Anhalas in order to defend themselves, not unlike the dryads of Brokilon.
Culture.
Naiads tend not to form large societies, preferring instead to spend their lives solitary or in small groups. They are often perceived as shy by humans, likely because they rarely know Common Speech and are a bit afraid of them.
As many other nymphs, rusalki enjoy music, which they perform by singing dancing in the moonlight. They are known to produce primitive tools, such as knives made of great mouthbrooder's teeth.
Characteristics.
Physical features.
Physically fit and agile, naiads are considered attractive by both humans and elves. They have long, usually black or green hair. Their skin tones range from alabaster white to almost greenish; Black-haired and white-skinned rusalki may be sometimes confused with much more dangerous bruxae.
Water nymphs, as all others, are perfectly adjusted to their environment. Perhaps most distinct such feature are the membranes between fingers that some of the naiads have, allowing them to swim even more easily. Such connection has its drawbacks however; rusalki must spend most of the time in or near fresh water as staying on dry land for too long would make them dry up and suffocate.
Mental traits.
Naiads are excellent telepaths and telempaths, basically immune to all kinds of mental attacks. They are also able to charm people and counter several . The most powerful rusalki may command waters of their lake at will, causing miniature storms in which they drown their opponents.
Procreation.
Naiads are exclusively female and use males of other humanoid races to reproduce. They tend to lure or charm young men to spend some time on mutual pleasure in a lake or river. While these encounters tend to proceed in friendly atmosphere, they may occasionally end badly for the male as the rusalka, when focused on the pleasure too much, may forget that humans are not able to breathe underwater.
Apart from the sexual encounters, a naiad can be made by mutating a child of different race in a similar way the dryads are created. Rusalki are often blamed for kidnapping young human girls on Saovine eve and reportedly replacing them with some "ugly changelings".

Zephyr

Zephyr was a drowned dead haunting the waters of Lakeside by Murky Waters.
Biography.
According to a story told by the Naiad, Zephyr was one of Vizima's most famous thieves before his death. Apparently, on his last escape attempt through the city sewers, his loot proved too heavy and his greed go great for him to survive and he drowned trying to keep it all.
Somehow, he ended up becoming a drowned dead – otherwise common post-Conjunction monster and not a cursed form but the poetic Naiad might as well have made the story up – and became the leader of the lakeside drowners near Murky Waters.
His theft of the Naiad's turquoise necklace was behind the Naiad's request when Geralt of Rivia first met her in 1270.

Memory of a Blade is a quest in Chapter II which basically begins when Geralt, to win his freedom from the dungeon, agrees to kill the cockatrice in the sewers. When he was thrown in jail, his possessions were confiscated by the City Guard, so he must be given a weapon to accomplish the task. Jethro gives our hero an alleged witcher's silver sword.
Walkthrough.
As Chapter II dawns, we find Geralt twiddling his thumbs, stuck in the dungeon with a bunch of losers after having been double-crossed by Mikul when he tried to enter Vizima using the letter of safe conduct from the Reverend. The situation seems a bit hopeless, but then there is a glimmer of hope: the captain offers anyone his freedom, who can kill a cockatrice currently stalking the sewers. The witcher immediately volunteers, but someone has beaten him to the punch.
At this point, the plot can go one of two ways, based on the outcome of a fistfight which is proposed to determine who gets to kill the monster. Either the Geralt "lets" the tough guy try his hand at killing the beast first by losing the fistfight, either deliberately or fairly, or he wins the right to fight the monster first. If the tough guy goes first, the expected happens and another monster-slayer will be required without delay.
The witcher basically finishes The Beast of the Sewers and then emerges a free mutant armed with a new silver sword. But where did it come from? Was it Berengar's sword? Questions abound, so our hero sets off to answer them by speaking to anyone remotely connected with the sword. His search leads him to Thaler, a gambler at The Hairy Bear, the gardener, Shani and finally Zoltan Chivay. Each conversation edging Geralt closer and closer to a positive ID on the weapon.
Based on what he overheard in the dungeon, Geralt begins by going to see Thaler, who sends him to the gambler, who in turn fingers the gardener, who positively identifies the sword as belonging to Coën, another witcher that Geralt once knew, mentioning that Shani also knew Coën. Shani fills in some of the gaps regarding Coën's fate and tells the witcher that Zoltan is an expert who could provide an appraisal. Finally, it is the dwarf who confirms that the weapon is indeed a good quality Witcher's silver sword and gives Geralt an Earth rune to use on it should he get the chance.
Phases.
The Sword at Thaler's.
Jethro spilled the beans... He said they found the silver sword at Thaler's place. I wonder where the fence got it from... I need to visit him as soon as this business is over. "I have to go and ask Thaler about the silver sword."
The Mysterious Owner.
My silver sword didn't belong to Berengar. I wonder how it ended up in Vizima. I should press Thaler a little harder. "I have to grill Thaler about the silver sword to find out how it ended up in Vizima."
The Dice Player.
Thaler bought the sword from some notorious dice gambler at "The Hairy Bear" inn. I need to go there and talk to the guy. "I have to go to "The Hairy Bear" and talk to the gambler." (250 XP)
The Gardener.
I managed to get some information from the wretched cheat. He won the sword from some gardener at St. Lebioda's hospital. "I have to talk to the gardener at St. Lebioda's hospital." (250 XP)
Shani.
I talked to the gardener. He found the sword after the battle of Brenna. Interesting, Shani worked as a medic during this battle. Maybe I'll find out more about the sword? You visit at night and have to bribe her grandmother"I have to talk to Shani about the sword." (250 XP)
Zoltan.
Shani told me about Coën, a witcher I used to know. He died in the Battle of Brenna. As for the sword itself - I should talk to Zoltan, he knows about things like that. "I should talk to Zoltan, he knows about things like that." (250 XP)
The Appraisal.
Zoltan gave my silver sword a professional appraisal. He says it is of absolutely prime quality. It's good to have a true witcher's sword with a history at hand. "I own a true witcher's sword of prime quality." ( + 1000 XP)
Failed.
I left Vizima. I will not have the chance to get to know the story of the silver sword.

Split salamander brooch

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
"The blow that killed the bandit split the brooch in two. Only a witcher's sword could have done this."
After a long search through the swamp, Geralt finds a cloven Salamandra medallion, along with Berengar's belongings on a mutilated corpse by the clay pits. This discovery leads him to conclude that Berengar must be dead.
This quest item should not be confused with ordinary Salamander brooches which look identical in every way. The only way to tell the difference is that this quest item stays in Geralt's quest items pocket and that regular badges remain in his normal inventory satchel.
This quest item appears to serve no purpose after acquisition.

&lt;/infobox&gt;The Hermit was a druid that dedicated his life to service of the Lady of the Lake and the protection of chivalric virtues.
"The Witcher".
The Hermit lives alone in his hut in the Fields near the village of Murky Waters, feeding his chickens and geese and tending to the barrows of the knights who died in the service of the Lady of the Lake. In fact, he is the only (living) human resident of the fields.
He is a learned man, for he spent most of his life as a diplomat for king Foltest, before he found his calling serving the Lady of the Lake. He is an expert in legends about the Holy Grail. He is also a Professional dice player and does a little trading on the side. He buys and sells:
He has work for a witcher in the form of the quest Hunting the Wild Hunt.
In the Epilogue, Geralt meets the Hermit one last time at the safe house in the Temple Quarter. It seems that he has decided to go back to his old diplomatic role and would like an audience with the King.
"Blood and Wine" expansion.
Where The Lady is, there is her servant. The Hermit of Lac Célavy seems to be someone other, who just happened to have some similiraties with hermit from Murky Waters. But the truth is that he is using illusions to look different for he wants to confuse Geralt.
In the Duchy of Toussaint he is known as guardian of the five chivalric virtues. Whosoever proves that these virtues are dwelling in his heart is then challenged to also prove his fighting skill during combat atop the water's surface. And if he manages to that, he is given Aerondight by the Lady of the Lake herself.
 "The hermit who lived on the isle on Lac Célavy had become the guardian of the duchy's Five Principle Virtues. This virtuous man watched over the boulders on which the virtues had been engraved and put any knights who came by through a trial to prove they embodied them. When the witcher arrived at the isle and met with the hermit, it seemed to him it was not their first encounter. Only later did he find out how right he was."
 "The hermit turned out to be the Lady of the Lake, a mysterious being whom Geralt had once met in Murky Waters. After Geralt passed the hermit's trials, the holy man changed form and showed him his true face, then bestowed upon Geralt a gift: the sword Aerondight."

Munro Bruys

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Munro Bruys was an adventurer from Mahakam in the company of Zoltan Chivay during the 1260s. After the Battle of Brenna, in which he avenged one of his mates Caleb Stratton, Bruys planned to do business in Novigrad. Eventually, he ended up a bouncer in Vizima.
Biography.
Life in a company.
A dwarf born in Mahakam, Bruys joined Chivay's band. For several days, the bard Jezkier traveled and sung by their side. During one such day, their camp had been approached by Brendan, another dwarven mercenary. Bruys grew warry but Chivay calmed him, introducing Brendan as an old friend.
Once, the group waylaid and robbed a rich hawker who tried to flee Dillingen after townfolk exposed his trade with Scoia'tael. The merchant defended his property like a lion, shouting for aid a few times until the dwarves got him with batons. Intending to fund future enterprises of each individual with the treasure, Bruys helped load the trunks on a wagon.
In early August 1267, Bruys and the rest had been escorting Kernow refugees, mothers and children, to safety. They met Geralt of Rivia and the witcher's own group for the first time on a way toward the Yaruga river from Brokilon. Chivay advised Geralt to join up with dwarves on their way eastward to refuge, which was accepted. When the large group became short on provisions, Bruys and Yazon Varda vanished into the dark, only to return at dawn with two full sacks, one with horse grub and the second with jerkies, cheese, huge haggis and other refreshments. Another time, he and Figgis Merluzzo went mushroom picking. Later on, Percival Schuttenbach sensed porridge with his infallible gnomish nose and stated people had to live nearby. Chivay decided he, Schuttenbach, and Geralt's companions would investigate, while Bruys and Merluzzo awaited for a signal in a form of a sparrowhawk call. Bruys anxiously asked Chivay when he learned bird sounds. Chivay answered the point was that if Bruys heard an unrecognizable sound, he would know it was them.
After crossing into Brugge, the group stopped at the river O. Convinced not to carry the treasure any longer, Zoltan ordered Bruys, Varda, Merluzzo and Caleb Stratton to hide it; the rest continued to Fen Carn. Much later, during an unexpected battle between the refugee-killing Nilfgaardians and the Temerian Army, Chivay's company reunited. They evaded death by running to the woods, but Stratton was hit by the 7th Daerlanian Cavalry Brigade. After burying Stratton and mourning his passing, the dwarves continued. They met Geralt and his company once more, in Angren, and Bruys gave each member a strong handshake. At long last, the company decided to return home to Mount Carbon.
Battle of Brenna.
As the end of the Second Northern War drew near, Bruys and Merluzzo were part of officer Zoltan Chivay's unit of the Mahakam Volunteer Army. In Spring 1268, most regiments sent by the Elder of Mahakam Brouver Hoog suffered great losses and were withdrawn to Vizima. With time to recover, most of the dwarves enjoyed beer and fist-fighting at The Shaggy Bear tavern.
To stop the advancing enemy, Temeria mustered its forces and prepared for the Battle of Brenna. Thousands of dogged dwarven volunteers commanded by Colonel Barclay Els stood the right-wing. Alongside the eight light cavalry companies and infamous Adieu's Free Company, unwavering in the face of Ard Feainn Division riders.
When Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn tried to run from the battlefield, half-buried in mud and pleading for mercy, Chivay showed him to Bruys. Mistaking the field marshal for a Daerlannian cavalryman due to his silver scorpion sigil, Bruys swung his weapon up. Thus, they avenged Stratton by unknowingly killing the Nilfgaardian commanding officer.
Novigrad and Vizima.
Bruys always dreamed of building steam and water-powered hammerworks. Following the Peace of Cintra, he agreed to start one in Novigrad with Merluzzo and Chivay. However, the mutual venture flopped. Bruys returned to Vizima, moving there for good as he landed a bouncer position at The Shaggy Bear. A self-titled professional dice player, Bruys earned bonus orens gambling.
In 1270, Bruys kept in touch with Zoltan Chivay, who told him the witcher Geralt, thought dead since the pogrom in Rivia, had lived. Initially refusing to believe him, the dwarf welcomed Geralt with open arms when the witcher entered the tavern in the Temple Quarter. When asked, Bruys praised his job as peaceful and reminded Geralt of their past adventures.

Conjunction of the Spheres

The Conjunction of the Spheres was a cataclysm which affected the whole Multiverse and occurred 1,500 years before the events in the novels, trapping many "unnatural" creatures in this dimension, including ghouls, graveirs, and vampires. Rifts were created by the collision of many different realms, filling the world of the gnomes and dwarves with hundreds of creatures of all shapes and sizes, as well as a mystical force that came to be known as "chaos" or "magic".
Unable to manipulate the forces of magic and with little preparation to fight the monsters that came through the conjunction of the different realms, the gnomes, dwarves, and elves, as well as many other displaced races such as the vran, werebbubbs, halflings, and the first humans, were plunged into a strange, dangerous, and uncertain time of conflict which lasted for many generations.
It was during this time that the elves say humans, or more specifically, the Dauk and Wozgor people, first appeared, their own world having been destroyed. Nordling humans settled on the Continent many hundreds of years after that, which event was later dubbed the First Landing. It is uncertain whether or not the two original human civilizations were extinct by the time the Nordlings arrived on the Continent.
"The Witcher".
There is also a book in the game by the same title.
Conjunction of the Spheres
"A cataclysm which occurred 1,500 years ago, trapping in our dimension many unnatural creatures, including ghouls, graveirs and vampires. These beasts have no ecological niches of their own and are merely relics of bygone times."
"According to elven lore, humans arrived during the Conjunction, their own world having been destroyed. These human ancestors learned how to harness the power of primordial Chaos, and thus the first human wizards were born. Looking for a place in the world, humans took up arms against the Elder Races, who were unable to withstand the barbarians and ultimately surrendered. This is how humans came to rule the world."
Source.
A book describing this event entitled The Conjunction of the Spheres can be purchased in Vergen in Chapter II. Reading the book provides a journal entry on the subject.
"There are scores of learned works, dissertations and treatises about this magical cataclysm from about 1,500 years ago. Because of this event, creatures never seen before entered our world, and still do not have their own ecological niche here. Among others, graveirs and ghouls are relics of the permeation of the spheres, though elven tradition has it that we, humans, are also newcomers from that time. The sorcerers claim that humanity received both the wondrous gift and the terrible curse that they consider magic to be at that time."
Journal entry.
"For more information, see :Second Conjunction."
After Geralt slays Eredin, he learns that Avallac'h has taken Ciri. After Yennefer teleports him away from a pack of Wild Hunt hounds, they witness another Conjunction of the Spheres beginning as monsters begin randomly appearing on Undvik.
They race to the tower of Tor Gvalch'ca where Avallac'h and Ciri are, but it is protected by a barrier. Yennefer manages to open it briefly so Geralt can get through. Geralt then confronts Avallac'h. However, Ciri appears, explaining that Avallac'h isn't a threat but the White Frost would consume all the worlds. Thus, she steps through a portal to confront and defeat the White Frost using her Elder Blood, preventing the apocalypse and ending the Conjunction.
"Before the Conjunction of the Spheres, an interdimensional cataclysm that struck fifteen hundred years before the present moment, the world was inhabited solely by nonhuman races—elves, dwarves, and other beings now long forgotten. It is they who first built magnificent cities, gave birth to high culture, and made the first steps toward enlightenment. After the cataclysm, everything changed. It is said the Conjunction of the Spheres not only first introduced human beings to this world, but also brought potent magic and bloodthirsty monsters to it as well. Creatures like ghouls, bruxae, and graveirs infested more and more land, killing settlers and destroying everything in their path. Century by century, the known world slowly ceased to exist and a new order was born, one where humans, short-lived, energetic beings with a thirst for expansion, conquered the high races of the olden days."

Eudora Breckenriggs was a dwarf woman that was engaged to Zoltan Chivay. However, the engagement never culminated into a marriage as Eudora's father called it off when he found out that Zoltan had assisted the Scoia'tael during the uprising in Vizima as he didn't want a "rebel firebrand" in the family.

Bomb making bases

Bomb making requires the "Bomb Preparation" skill (a silver Intelligence talent), so Geralt can not make bombs until he reaches level 15 at least (and then only if it is really a priority as other talents are much more useful). He can, however, use any bombs he finds. Bombs require , just like potions, but the bases are different. All bomb-making bases are referred to as "black powder" irrespective of the actual color of the item.

Jewelry

Jewelry in "The Witcher" is used for three main purposes: as gifts (rings and necklaces), as means of entry into restricted areas, or as quest items. Below is a list of these, starting with all "regular jewelry" which can be bought, sold, or given as gifts. A list of gems can be found on a separate page.
Rings.
A ring. "A valuable item which can be sold or given to someone."
Signet Rings.
These rings can not be bought initially, but once acquired, they can be sold and re-purchased.

Basilisk hide

"The Witcher".
These are harvested from dead basilisks. The skin of these lizards is all the rage in the more fashion conscious circles of Kovir. The experience points for the basilisk kill is worth it alone. This is sadly not the case in "The Price of Neutrality" premium module. Although they are skinnable items, these hides have no alchemical value whatsoever.

Vampire is a hypernym used to refer to a number of creatures that thrive on blood, which contains their victims' life force.
Andrzej Sapkowski.
Vampires in Sapkowski's works break with many popular stereotypes. In particular, vampire repellents such as holy water, crucifixes, garlic, wooden stakes, etc. are nothing but folklore within the Witcher saga. For example, Regis, the vampire who accompanies Geralt for a time, was once decapitated, staked through the heart, sprinkled with holy water and finally buried, but that did not prevent him from regenerating, albeit slowly.
Facts and myths.
As Regis traveled with Geralt, he clarified on a number of myths regarding vampires as such:
Book quotes.
A vampire, or upir, is a dead person brought to life by Chaos. Having lost its first life, a v. enjoys its second life during the night hours. It leaves its grave by the light of the moon and only under its light may it act, assailing sleeping maidens or young swains, who it wakes not, but whose blood it sucks. pg. 143, "Baptism of Fire" (U.K. edition)
"Don't scoff. You can't be a stranger to vampire bite marks. Ever come across a case of a vampire ripping its victim to shreds?""No. That never happens.""In the case of higher vampires — never, I agree," Emiel Regis said softly. "From what I know alpors, moolas, bruxas and nosferats don't mutilate their victims. On the other hand, fleders and ekimmas are pretty brutal with their victims' remains." pg. 151, "Baptism of Fire" (U.S. edition)
"The Witcher".
There is at least two points where the game breaks with Sapkowski's written works regarding vampires:
"Blood and Wine" expansion.
Of named higher vampires, Geralt can encounter up to four: Regis, Dettlaff van der Eretein, Orianna, and the Unseen Elder of Toussaint.
Throughout the main story quest La Cage au Fou, Regis and Geralt's exploration of Tesham Mutna reveals that vampires descend from three ancient tribes that arrived on the Continent during the Conjunction of the Spheres. A single portal opened from their world in caves underneath what later became Toussaint. The symbols of these tribes remain deep within the ruins, serving as reminders of their original realm.
The main story also expanded on the capabilities of a higher vampire: they are unique and have skills that accompanies it, and they are impregnable to most methods of extermination, practically giving higher vampires some form of immortality; and a set of vampiric codes that applies to all vampires, no matter the classification:

"Regardless of all his madness, Alzur managed to arrive at some surprising results. He came to the conclusion that he would discover the secrets of animating inanimate matter when he learned to animate energy. According to Alzur, a golem would work only when filled with living power that would imitate a divine pneuma - a soul. The wizard did not have a chance to finish his research but his experiments revealed the secret of the Thunder and Shield spells. Alzur was able to summon living lightning capable of locating and following its target, and a living shield capable of releasing such lightning. The fools would only see his discoveries as weapons even more powerful than the viy of Maribor or the infamous koshchey. However, I can clearly see that Alzur's Thunder is yet another stop on the path leading to creating a perfect being."

The Ice Plains is the place of Jaques' visions, to which the Grand Master teleports Geralt in the Epilogue, during the Frozen Reflections quest, as he attempts to convince him that what he has done is all for the greater good. Regardless of the time of day, this area is always in full daylight.
It should be noted that potions last much longer here as time is slowed by about ten times. 4 hour effects become 40 hour effects. Any potions taken prior to traveling here will also be affected.

&lt;/infobox&gt;Kikimore workers are resourceful, cautious, and as industrious as ants. It is hard to believe that these spider-like creatures have so few admirers willing to observe and emulate them. Perhaps this is because researchers and collectors of insects seldom return from expeditions to kikimore colonies, and thus never disseminate their findings about these splendid creatures.
 "Kikimores are an insult to the gods, the filthiest creatures on Earth. They are repulsive in their resemblance to spiders, and even the smallest of them, the workers, are dangerous.' So say the uneducated, superstitious and stupid. The truth is far different! Kikimore workers rarely appear near human settlements, and even then they only attack when threatened. Is there anything more beautiful than a kikimore - a symbol of hard work, resourcefulness and caution?Master Dorregaray, The Wonderful World of Insectoids"

Kikimore workers were reintroduced with the "Blood and Wine" expansion. Their bestiary entry can be obtained by reading .
"The old fool came home all black and blue, claiming kikimores had attacked him in the woods. Who does he take me for?! His mates worked him over because he'd cheated at gwent. If it'd been kikimores, he'd be dead. And I'd have peace at last.– Lavinia, wife of a Beauclair innkeeper"
"Kikimores form colonies, making them similar to communal insects such as ants. A kikimore colony is ruled by a queen and organized into something of a social hierarchy. Kikimore workers take care of hunting food and bringing it back to the nest, while kikimore warriors defend the nest against attackers."
"A worker on its own can be easily killed by even a weak person or a child. It is rare indeed, however, to come across an isolated individual, for kikimore workers usual move in groups of a few to a dozen or so members. The only defense against a swarm of kikimores available to a normal person is to flee. And not even that is guaranteed to work."
"Kikimore workers listen to orders given by kikimore warriors. On command, a swarm of workers might begin burrowing tunnels near potential prey to allow for a surprise mass attack. Eliminate the warrior guiding a swarm, however, and the workers will disperse and cease digging."
"Kikimore workers are nimbler and quicker than warrriors."
"They show complete immunity to the Axii Sign, and when they dig tunnels, they are invulnerable to all the other Signs as well. Poison also does them no harm."
"A good method for fighting them is to use the Igni Sign as well as oils and bombs meant to damage insectoids."

"Then the kikimore princess summoned all her loyal sisters and off they went! Together they charged the enemy trying to harm their queen.– "The Kikimore Princess and the Mountain Giants"Cornelius Briggs (dwarven children's fable, fragment)"
"It is unknown how exactly it is kikimores communicate with each other. Autopsies are hampered by the high toxicity of their subjects. Scholars have established that kikimores do not seem to possess any detectable auricles. One amateur researcher, Count di Salvaress, put forth a theory in his treatise "A Microscope Among Monsters" suggesting kikimores have a highly developed sense of smell and use airborne particles undetectable to humans to transmit information. This theory has yet to be proved or disproved."
"Kikimore warriors defend their nests from attackers. They attack somewhat slower than kikimore workers. They are able to spew streams of caustic venom a great distance and leap to attack. This venom is highly unique in that it reacts with a witcher's body to raise the level of his potion toxicity. They are covered with thick, hard armor which easily deflects blows from even the sharpest sword."
"Kikimore warriors are protected by swarms of workers which obey their orders until they are themselves eradicated."
"They are completely immune to the effects of the Axii Sign, but vulnerable to Igni, oils and bombs harming insectoids and blows dealt by a silver sword."

Teleporter

To meet Witcher Wiki's quality standards, this article or section may require cleanup.&lt;br&gt;Please help Witcher Wiki by editing the article or discuss this issue on the In the Witcher novels, teleporters called "portals" are used to travel not only from place to place, but also through time for a certain few who possess the appropriate genetic make-up.
"The Witcher".
Teleporters are an incredibly handy way to get around when moving between the swamp, Trade and Temple Quarters. No more spending endless hours trudging from one place to another, this is instant travel. It also economizes on all the fares you would otherwise be giving the ferryman.
There seems to be a theme in the game about teleporters, perhaps relating to incidents mentioned in the books. Several people, Kalkstein and Leuvaarden in particular, relate stories of unfortunate people who used teleporters less than successfully. These individuals often arriving at their destinations in pieces. The actual functioning of the teleporters are not really explored further, but in the cut scenes, Geralt does look like he is being "sucked in" when he uses them.
Triss' mirror also functions as a telecommunicator (as is shown in the opening cut scene of Chapter III), very versatile... and I suppose Triss herself, on occasion, could be considered a teleporter. She does teleport our hero at least twice during the game: first to the Salamandra base and then away from danger. There is a suggestion of a third time, otherwise how would Triss have gotten an unconscious Geralt out of the swamp and into her bedroom in the Trade Quarter anyway?

Raffard the White was a Temerian sorcerer and alchemist who served King Abdank, though as the king was disabled, he served as "de facto" ruler.
Biography.
Six Years' War.
In 830, the so-called Six Years' War broke out in which Abdank together with his vassals fought against Cintra for control over lands in middle Yaruga. Its became devastating for both sides until 836, when Raffard managed to reconcile the kings and convince them to negotiate a peace treaty. 
The war resulted in Raffard's increasing importance in court and he was even offered the crown. In a noble gesture, Raffard refused it but nevertheless accepted the position of the first adviser in which he effectively exerted actual power.
Royal Advisor.
In order to keep Abdank busy, Raffard fed his interest in alchemy. All sorts of alchemists from different lands were promised fame and fortune, invited to Vizima, ordered to turn lead into gold, and then executed after they failed. Ultimately the word got around and alchemists began to avoid Temeria.
Brotherhood War.
Sometime in the second half of the century, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers formed the Chapter of the Gift and the Art, and those who refused to acknowledge the Chapter and submit to their laws, including Raffard, were killed in a bloody war of mages.

 "The vodyanoi are an ancient, sentient race. They worship their own gods, and their priests deal with divine matters. Land dwellers know little of these underwater creatures and the cults which flourish among them, and what is known inspires fear.

Vodyanoi warriors are the stronger variety of vodyanoi who protect other, weaker vodyanoi, like the priests.
 "The sight of vodyanoi warriors striding ashore is a sign that a transgression has been committed against the fishpeople - either the border to an underwater kingdom has been crossed or a taboo under one of the many vodyanoi religions has been violated. The warriors' primary duty is to guard the underwater kingdom, though when necessary they leave their domain to seek justice for some perceived harm. Both tasks are performed with precision and emotionlessly. They do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives in service to the powers of the Deep."

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
This page contains general tips for gameplay.
Make a shopping list.
Or just use ours (now available in pdf format! 241 KB), and consult it frequently. It goes without saying that being prepared makes any quest far more enjoyable. There is nothing worse than arriving at a destination (especially if it was a hard fight to get there), only to realize that you have not brought the very item you need.
Inventory Management.
Remember that inventory space is at a premium so stock up on items that stack preferentially. Keep anything you do not need immediately at your local inn (Dandelion provides this service in the epilogue, but only at the very beginning, once part way through and then at the very end of the Chapter. You can not just go see him to get stuff). Try to keep your inventory to a minimum. This is not always easy, but there are some steps you can take to make life easier.
Brewing Potions during meditation.
While it is not catastrophic, if you do not have any empty inventory slots when you are brewing new potions, they will be dropped on the ground or floor wherever you happen to be meditating. Just remember to pick them up as they will disappear if you walk too far away and come back (loadscreen). Keeping at least one slot empty prior to meditation completely avoids this potential nuisance.
Fighting Groups.
When fighting a group of opponents, first decide if you can relatively easily "take" an individual of the same kind of opponent. If not, run away as it is not a great idea to get yourself surrounded by difficult opponents. If so, then it is game on! 
Tip: This exploits the fact that your chances of hitting multiple opponents is based on your chance of hitting your primary target.
Raiding multiple bodies after a battle.
It can sometimes get confusing when you are raiding the bodies of a large number of dead opponents (or even a not-so-large stack of bodies). Trying to distinguish which "remains" you have searched and which you have not can cause you to check the same body multiple times, which is a waste of time.
One trick (especially when it comes to daggers and swords) is to drop the items you have in the weapon slots in order to fill the slots with the weapons found on the remains. This way, you "empty" each corpse and it is no longer "click-able" and you will not end up searching it twice (though you will lose potential coin).
The same can be said for keeping at least one slot in your inventory empty. As you raid a corpse, instead of using the "transfer all" icon, double-click on each individual item to pick it up, but not close the inventory screen. Then, drop each one you do not want to keep, and pick up the next item. Repeat until the corpse is "empty."
Fistfighting made easy.
Depending on the amount of previous gaming experience one has, fist-fighting might seem daunting. (I can only speak for myself, but I completely avoided fist fights the first time I played this game.) The good news is that as it turns out, fist-fighting is a breeze. Simply follow these three easy steps:
Voilà! You can win every single fist-fight this way and take very little, if any, damage. You do not need any of the fist-fighting-related talents. However, you might want to keep an eye on your Endurance, as every "duck" drains it. Once you run out, you can not duck.
Tip: If you feel like cheating, grab a Tawny Owl before the fight.
It is also possible to win every fight easily without blocking at all. Just hit your opponent in the exact moment he winds up to hit you. This will not only damage him but also interrupt his hit (you'll stay unharmed). Just repeat this until the match is over.
Drinking contests made easy.
Drinking contests may be new to you. They were to me. Do not despair, they are even easier than fistfights. Use beer, the cheapest beer you can find. That is it! Nothing more complicated. You can try to be the "big man" and use Temerian rye or something stronger, but why?

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
Coccacidium is an unusually vicious and large archespore in the Swamp. It is particularly nasty if Geralt is not very experienced. Vincent Meis will pay handsomely for its head.
Associated quest.
The Coccacidium usually spawns in a few places preferentially, but the longer you manage to avoid it, the more likely it is to spawn, so after a while it really begins to feel like you are being chased.

Savolla was an ambitious mage working for the Salamandra, further training in magic under its leader Azar Javed. With an enthralled frightener, Savolla was a vital part of the Salamandra's attack on the School of the Wolf but died during the fight.
Biography.
Attack on Kaer Morhen.
Before the attack itself, Savolla had a sort of argument with the Professor, Salamandra's other leader who was afraid there would be no witcher left for him to fight after Savolla led the principal charge.
In May 1270, Savolla accompanied his master Azar Javed and the Professor during the attack on Kaer Morhen. Like other Salamandra mages, he preferred to let the non-magical ranks deal with the actual crossing of swords while he hanged back using magic to summon all sorts of extra foes and effects. Savolla was more powerful than many of his brethren, enough to control a frightener. Even that, however, did not save him from his death at the hands of either Geralt of Rivia or Triss Merigold.
Legacy.
Years later, the hole in the walls of Kaer Morhen left by the Salamandra attack became known as the "Savolla's breach", remaining in place as the Wolf witchers had no time to repair it. The Wild Hunt eventually utilized this weakness during the Battle of Kaer Morhen.

Elder Blood is a book in "The Witcher".
It discusses the abilities of Sources: individuals in whose veins courses elder blood.
Elder Blood"Vilgefortz of Roggeveen"
"It is impossible to accurately trace the genes of Lara Dorren. The fates of entire generations are lost to time, their picture further distorted by unclear lineages, bastard children, intentional historical falsification and a simple lack of records. In many cases, Elder Blood is too thin and has lost its power."
"Moreover, not every Source attributes their magical skills to the presence of Lara's genes. A few, in whom the mutation has occurred, are marked by extraordinary abilities. They are able to travel through time and space and possess certain magical abilities. These talents are, however, wild and uncontrolled, manifesting themselves in times of stress or strong emotions, surprising even their possessors."
"History knows of travelers flung far in time and space by their own abilities. That is why the Brotherhood of Sorcerers should take special care of Source-children, raise them under its watchful eyes."

Medical Science

Medical Science is a book in "The Witcher".
Medicine
"For centuries, diseases have plagued mankind, yet when Jan Bekker subjected the Power to his will, people gained a powerful weapon in their fight against disease. Mages study bacteria and viruses, the ways germs spread as well as genetics. Their research is used by medics, who set up hospitals and produce increasingly effective medicines. There are also magical potions capable of healing wounds and internal injuries. Many magic users, such as Marti Sodergren or Visenna, have become healers, traveling the world and using their magic for the good of others."
Medicical Science
"Autopsies are not universally approved of in criminal investigations. However, experts acknowledge the value of forensically examining a corpse after witnesses have been questioned and experts consulted. An autopsy can provide valuable information on the identity of a victim and on the precise means by which a crime was committed. While performing an autopsy, you should ask detailed questions based on the knowledge you possess. By rejecting impossibilities one by one, you may ultimately find that the truth lies in the most unlikely of hypotheses."

Dimeritium

Dimeritium is a special metal which suppresses magical power. Vilgefortz of Roggeveen, Artaud Terranova and a few other Chapter members, were shackled with dimeritium after they were accused of treason by Philippa Eilhart and Dijkstra during the reunion of mages on Thanedd Island. It was stated that being shackled causes unpleasant side-effects for the mages.
Three-quarters of all dimeritium is produced in the northern kingdom of Kovir and Poviss.
From 1272 to 1276, during the witch hunts, the witch hunters of the Eternal Fire were trained to use dimeritium handcuffs when arresting mages.
 Dimeritium
"Dimeritium is a rare and precious metal with an interesting feature — it represses the transfer of magical energy. A bluish alloy of iron and dimeritium is used to produce handcuffs and necklaces. Those who wear them cannot cast spells or use magic in any way. There are known cases, however, of extraordinarily powerful sorcerers managing to overcome the shield generated by dimeritium."
"The Witcher".
Source.
Dimeritum plays a larger role in the Witcher 3, being used to craft weapons and armor, it's difficult to find but not impossible. One source of dimeritium are witch hunters, during some missions where you kill them you can loot their bodies and find dimeritium shackles. Due to the widespread persecution of mages during the game, dimeritium is used extensively by people to successfully subdue mages and render them helpless. Lastly, the metal can also be used to craft bombs that cancel out monsters abilities, be warned however, dimeritium also has the ability to cancel out Geralt's signs if you're within the blast radius, leaving both combatants vulnerable.

<doc id="4322" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4322" title="Codringher and Fenn">
Codringher and Fenn

Codringher and Fenn was a famous law firm and detective agency in Dorian. It was founded by two men: Codringher and Fenn and had a reputation for getting the job done — for the right price. Their legal assistance was described to be somewhat dubious, because it often involved irrefutable cases being overturned through the sudden disappearing of evidence and witnesses suddenly redacting their testimonies or all-out vanishing.
For some time, Geralt of Rivia (and probably many others) assumed that Codringher and Fenn were one and the same person; that Fenn was simply another of Codringher's convenient aliases. But while Codringher did use other aliases, Fenn did in fact exist, though he rarely chose to be seen.
History.
Search for Ciri.
Around 1266, they were approached by King Foltest of Temeria's spies who were searching for Ciri and Geralt. Protecting the witcher and his ward, he told them Ciri had died three years previous in a refugee camp in Angren of diphtheria, suffering before her death.
The following year, in June, they were informed by Dandelion of the mage Rience's escape in Oxenfurt, and later tasked by Geralt to learn what he could on Rience in the hopes of finding out what he wanted with Ciri. While most of the mage's background was missing, Codringher sold Geralt the information for 250 crowns, which did provide new insight into the mage's past before stating he could help the witcher make the problem disappear: to send a false Ciri that was of similar age and appearance as the real one, but the witcher refused. Codringher then promised to continue protecting Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefer's location if agents were to contact him. He also helped Geralt find out about Akerspaark's sons and thus uncovered a fraud.
On the last night of the month, during the Thanedd coup, Codringher was looking over new information he had acquired, showing the carriers of the Elder Blood; proving one of Ciri's ancestors was the infamous Falka, who had cursed those present just before she was burned alive that one day one of her descendants would destroy them. After presenting the information to Fenn, Condringher decided he was going to try and take part in the dangerous political environment going on with this information, three visitors knocked on the door. Ever cautious, when asked by the visitors for Codringher he pretended to be a servant named Mikael Dullod, but the three, Schirrú, Millet and Nazarian, knew who he was and Schirrú stabbed him in the stomach, and then again pulling the blade up to his chest. They then found Fenn before setting fire to the agency on Rience's orders, as Codringher lay dying, probably only the chimney and half of the facade surviving the blaze.
"The Witcher".
In the game, we hear about the agency of Codringher and Fenn when detective Maarloeve claims to have trained with them. The glossary entry (below) in the game is taken from the novels. It alone suggests that Raymond's "investigative techniques" would likely be far from orthodox, if he did train with the firm.
Codringher and Fenn
"A famous pair of lawyers who ran a firm in Dorian until both partners died tragically under mysterious circumstances. At its height, the firm was retained by people from all over Temeria. If someone had difficulties, troubles, problems - they went to Codringher and Fenn. So the firm's clients quickly received proof of dishonesty and malpractice by their business partner. They could count on receiving credit from a bank without insurance or security. As one of a long list of creditors, they would be the only one to exact what was due from the company declaring bankruptcy. Their son would be released from the dungeon and cleared of all charges based either on irrefutable evidence or a lack thereof, because if evidence existed it disappeared mysteriously while witnesses retracted any earlier testimony. The wife's lover or the daughter's suitor would suffer complicated fractures in three limbs, including at least one upper one - all as a result of an unfortunate accident. And an enemy with a grudge or some other troublesome individual would soon stop being a nuisance, often vanishing into thin air. That's how Codringher and Fenn worked."

According to believers, one can either follow the path of Destiny of one's free will or try to resist it, although the latter can bring grim consequences. On the other hand, some feel that Destiny is not everything. These people say that something more is needed in order to bind two lives together, even if the rules of fate decide otherwise."
"The poet Dandelion contemplates whether human life is ruled by Destiny. Dandelion mentions the Law of Surprise — when a witcher demands from a man rescued on the road that which he does not expect once he returns home. It turns out to be a child born during the father's absence. Witchers take the Unexpected Children to their fortresses and train them to be their successors. Dandelion also wonders whether love can bind people with bonds of destiny. In no ballad does he provide a clear answer to the questions posed."

Kalkstein's notes

Kalkstein's notes make up a single quest item which helps Geralt locate the sephirot required to open the mysterious Mage's tower in the Swamp.
Kalkstein's notes
"In his sharply inclined hand, Kalkstein scrawled some notes about where to look for the Sephirot."
"Here's what I've read from Kalkstein's notes:"
"Compassion — Tipperath: Declan Leuvaarden. Fortunately Kalkstein spelled this one out for me. I never would've drawn the link between Leuvaarden and compassion."
"Mercy — Kezath: Vaska, leader of the brickmakers in the swamp. Now, how does mercy figure into our relationship?"
"Kingdom — Maal'kad: The sewers beneath Vizima. One of my favorite places. Kalkstein must have had a gnome for an ancestor if he managed to associate sewers with some bit from a book."
"Understanding, Power, Glory — Veen'ah, Ghe'vrath, 'Oth: The statues of Melitele, one in the swamp, the other in Saint Lebioda's Hospital. I have no idea what prayer without faith can possibly mean, but it's worth a try."
"Foundation — Y'esath: The cave in the swamp. More evidence to show that Kalkstein's ancestors were gnomes. A cave in the swamp and the concept of a foundation — I can't make anything of it. We'll see."
"Victory — Neh'tza: The Tower Sentry, right, that wasn't hard... Except that I need to defeat him..."
"Crown — Keth'aar: Destiny. Here Kalkstein outdid himself. His notes indicate I'll find the last sephirah by chance, for instance, while sitting in the privy or in the roast chicken I order at The Hairy Bear. An unknown. Destiny will throw it in my hands. Next time I see Kalkstein, I'll ask him if he hides his gnomish roots on purpose, fearing racist persecution..."

&lt;/infobox&gt;
A Long Way from Home is a secondary quest in Chapter II which Geralt can undertake if he asks Yaren Bolt a second time if he needs the services of a witcher, having already completed Flowers and Gold for him. Despite being optional, it does provide quite a lot of meaningful information about the main quests and should not be neglected.
Walkthrough.
Having sorted out the Flowers and Gold quest for the lumberjack, Geralt asks Yaren Bolt if he needs the services of a witcher for any other tasks. As it happens, the woodcutter does. He divulges that the way from the Lumberjacks' glade to the landing is blocked by monsters. These monsters include: bloedzuigers, drowners, echinopsae and vodyanoi, and this makes life for him and his band of woodcutters difficult to say the least.
Yaren also would like the witcher to get rid of the vodyanoi near the clay pits. He does not exactly explain why he wants to be rid of the "fish people", as he derisively refers to them, but it is part of the deal. Geralt points out that this is not really the best of ideas and that what the lumberjack is requesting amounts to a massacre, but there is no swaying Bolt.
Geralt decides to accept regardless and sets off to clear the road with his usual speed and efficiency, but he is still having doubts about the vodyanoi angle. He slices and dices his way through three bloedzuigers, a trio of drowners and a pair of echinopsae. There! Road cleared.
Spare the vodoyanoi:
At this point, our hero is quite close to the Brickmakers' village. He just can not bring himself to just kill some creatures who have done nothing as far as he can see, so he decides to have another chat with the local Water Lords expert, Vaska. It is a good thing he does as the eldress outlines a way to make peace between the vodyanoi and the woodcutters which would avoid any bloodshed: offer Yaren's axe as a sacrifice and token of peace on the altar near the clay pits.
Geralt decides to follow her advice and goes back to tell Yaren about the new development. He manages to convince the dwarf to give up his axe. The witcher then goes off to the clay pits to place the axe upon the altar and wait for some sign that the offering has been accepted.
Kill the vodoyanoi:
Now for the vodyanoi, after all, a contract is a contract. The witcher quells any doubts and continues with his mission.
 He goes to a nearby campfire and meditates until nearly midnight, then heads over to the vodyanoi altar.
Spare the vodoyanoi:
He checks the altar and sees that the fish people have left their own offering, an amulet.
Kill the vodoyanoi:
He kills the lone vodyan at the altar. [If you take the amulet, you can kill the lone vodyan without consequence]
The witcher then heads back to the Lumberjacks' glade to report to Yaren. The woodcutter is pleased that the road has been cleared and rewards Geralt as agreed.
Phases.
Monsters.
The lumberjacks are in trouble - they have been cut off from supplies by wandering monsters. Yaren Bolt promised to pay me if I can deal with this threat. I must quickly kill the monsters blocking the road and take care of the vodyanoi issue. Time really matters - perhaps I should go to Vaska, as she seems to get along with the fishpeople well. "I must kill the monsters blocking the road and take care of the vodyanoi issue as quickly as possible. Perhaps I should turn to Vaska with this problem."
Bloedzuigers.
A group of bloedzuigers has been destroyed - the swamps are now a better place. "I killed a few bloedzuigers. I should eliminate any creatures that threaten the lumberjacks." (100 XP)
If Clay Pits was not completed: The echinopsae are dead and I doubt anyone will miss them. "I killed some echinopsae. I should eliminate any creatures that threaten the lumberjacks." (100 XP)
If Clay Pits was already completed: The echinopsae are dead and I doubt anyone will miss them. "I should eliminate any creatures that threaten the lumberjacks. Vaska might tell me something interesting about the vodyanoi." (100 XP)
Drowners.
The drowners left this world - this time for good. "I killed a few drowners. I should eliminate any creatures that threaten the lumberjacks." (100 XP + 200 XP when all monsters are dead)
Side with Vaska: Vaska, the elder woman of the brickmakers, persuaded me to try and settle the conflict with the vodyanoi peacefully. She instructed me how to deliver messages to the aquatic race. I should get their attention by placing an item on the altar between the clay pits. A vodyan will then come at night and leave an item as well. Placing Yaren's axe on the altar will show our will to lay down weapons and make peace. "I have to convince Yaren Bolt to sacrifice his axe."
Kill the vodyanoi: I told Vaska that I intend to solve the dispute by killing the fishpeople's priest. She wasn't pleased to say the least. I'll find the priest by the altar near the clay pits. He comes at night. "I intend to kill the vodyanoi priest by the altar."
Sided with Vaska: I convinced Yaren Bolt [to] solve the problem without bloodshed. He gave me his axe to present to the vodyanoi as a sign of peace. I must take it to the altar. At midnight one of the fishpeople will appear. If he approves of the offering, he'll leave something in return. "I must sacrifice the axe on the Vodyanoi altar."
Spare the vodyan:I left the axe on the altar and in return I received an amulet which symbolizes peace. I must go to Yaren Bolt and tell him about it. "I need to clear the road to the landing, make sure people can get there safely." (1000 XP)
Killed the vodyan: I killed the vodyan the lumberjacks were so afraid of. "I need to clear the road to the landing, make sure people can get there safely."(500 XP)
Timely return: I did everything Yaren Bolt asked me to do. I should go to him to collect my reward. "I should go to Yaren Bolt to collect my reward."
Tardy return: I waited too long. Yaren Bolt wasn't too happy when he learned the monsters killed several lumberjacks and dispersed the others. I'm out of luck - no reward this time. "My mission failed." (500 XP + Lesson: don't go wandering around doing other stuff when you are supposed to be at the Vodyanoi altar)
If Geralt gave Yaren the Beggartick: Yaren Bolt is happy with my services. He paid me according to the agreement. "Yaren Bolt paid as agreed." (400 + 1000 XP)
If Geralt kept the Beggartick: Yaren Bolt is happy with my services. He paid me according to the agreement. "Yaren Bolt paid as agreed." (100 + 1000 XP)

The Witcher Cheapskate's Guide

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Are you frugal? Thrifty? Economical? A miser? A tightwad? All right, a cheapskate? Does that extend to your behavior when you play "The Witcher"? Well it does for me, so in keeping with that philosophy, here are a few tips on saving orens in the game. Also, in the game the trade-offs are usually between time and money, and since time seems to stretch infinitely, money is key. The tips are especially useful in the first 3 chapters (or acts). After that, you will have pretty much all the cash you need. You can also check out the price lists for more information.
Do not advance the plot.
Do not advance the narrative "prematurely". Take your time (remember, it is pretty much infinite in the game). A nifty feature of the game is that very, "very" few quests are time-sensitive (a couple are, so do be careful, see the note below). The "sequence" of quests can be important, but rarely the actual time it takes or when you do it. Talk to all the minor or incidental characters first and get what information and goods you can before you start chatting up major players. I do not leave many quests half done, unless forced or permitted to do so by the narrative.
Note: The Source can be delayed for most of Chapter III. This saves on screechy encounters with whomever did not get to take care of Alvin. All optional quests are just that, optional, so you can do them any time. A Long Way from Home does involve a time sensitive task, so do not dilly-dally.
Do not pay cover charges.
Are you cheap and bloodthirsty too? If so, you save even more orens by killing Ramsmeat's guards outside his house. If you let them live, you will have to pay them each time you want to enter and that adds up. do not forget to grab the key! Additionally, this is the only key in the game which is not a quest item, so it is possible to lose it. Two guards = two keys, so what I do (because I am compulsive that way) is leave one copy in storage, just in case I lose the other one (or have to dump it to pick up something valuable to convert to cash).
However, it has been pointed out that Ramsmeat's men respawn with amazing regularity and they all have keys, so worrying about losing the key is rather needless.
Maximize your harvests.
Make sure you have all the bestiary entries you need for any given chapter. This way you will get the most out of your kills, whether that means quest items, ingredients for potions or just stuff to cash in, it is worthwhile. Of course, this does cause some consternation when trying to buy as few books as possible, but it can be done. Just take your time when you first get to a new area and speak to only minor NPCs, do not initiate conversation with any of the major characters until you have exhausted all the freebies available without advancing the plot.
Use the first two silver talents you get to get the Ingredient Extraction attribute from the Intelligence attribute tree (requires level 3 Intelligence). This means you will get two of the base ingredients from every monster you kill (drowner brains, ghoul blood etc.). You will more often than not also get secondary ingredients such as cadaverine, Ginatz's Acid and other potentially valuable things from kills and have a higher chance of getting two herbs from a single plant. Even for things like drowner brains that only have a 1 selling price, the numbers stack up really quickly. Kalkstein buys any and all monster ingredients and all herbs can be sold to either the Gardener or the Elder druid for a fair price.
There is a nearly endless supply of salamanders in acts II and III. They are piece of cake so you do not need a potion. They carry salamander badges which can be sold for 10 per unit to Leuvaarden's messenger at the Hairy Bear. Selling them to Declan might seem like a better deal as he pays 20 each, but he will only do this a limited number of times as it part of a quest. Sometimes they leave fisstech in their remains. That can be sold to Coleman or the Order armorer for 20 a box. The best way to maximize these potential harvests is to kill salamanders before embarking on any quests in the non-human district and the prime time is around 12:00 AM – 1:00 AM. Resting between battles at one of the houses nearby.
Details on farming salamander badges and fisstech. Don't let Coleman die (if you sold weapons to elfs in chapter I) by entering detective office, and don't do drinking contest with messenger( 5 beers - if you do that he will tell you who is his boss and disappear) just drink one beer and there will be an option to sell badges(at the start there is not one). Now the farming: sleep at Kalkstein until midnight (+- few hours) exit his house go right, they will spawn behind some green door accros the dwarven blacksmith, I suggest not going behind the corner because fleder can spawn. They spawn 3-4 and sometime additional 2 salamanders, but from guys that spawn only half have badges but almost all have fisstech(better for us more gold). Fight tactics: level up group steel(all bronze will do) it make fights faster. Back to Kalkstein sleep 24 hours repeat (sometimes dead bodies don't disappear and new salamandra don't spawn, so you go and rest for one more day).
Typically three to four salamanders appear per night. Sometimes there is a bit of respawning so it is a good idea to double check the non-human district after completing any night-time quests. There is some evidence that killing salamanders after interacting of certain NPCs will cause a change in the number of Salamanders who appear and also cause them to drop more gems, rings and wine (all are decent items to sell, though rings are of course much more lucrative).
In Chapter III just cruise around the Trade quarter at night, beware of kikimores!
Three of the most profitable monster ingredients that are easy to obtain:
For those with less fortitude (fighting Bloedzuiger can be a pain) or time, you might want to stick with picking herbs.
Just a few simple Swamp runs, you can easily afford the Excellent Leather Jacket (5000 ) in Chapter II without having to play dice with Thaler a few hundred times.
Speaking of Thaler, get real friendly with him in Chapter II. He is just like 7-11, so he works like a 24/7 non-stop merchant (You can even wake him up if he is sleeping). You will no longer need to store all your loot in the Inn until you can sell them in daytime, just dump everything to old reliable Thaler any time you feel like. The best part is that he buys weapons at the same rate as any other Arms merchant.
Manage your time.
Always take the long lasting potions first if you take several. This way you can meditate for one hour after taking them to remove the toxic effects and still have seven hours left of the effect and zero toxicity. Take the shorter lasting potions after meditating.
Oils and temporary rune stones are actually the most economical thing to help you fight as they last for 24 hours, use them regularly.
Bombs appear to be the most time-consuming toys, but many players reported that they are very handy in some rather nasty battles.
Save on Lighting, Storage, Toxicity.
Typically, whenever you enter a crypt a swig of Cat is called for. By far, the more economical way of keeping dark places lit is simply to use the Quen sign - It casts a protective shield around the witcher, which also glows.
You no longer have to keep your inventory stuffed with Cat. Unlike a torch, you will be able to wield a real weapon. You don't suffer the downside of accumulating toxins and there is the added buff against damage.
Try not to level up the Quen sign beyond level 2 so that the casting cost is only 15 endurance. And it will still allow you to extend the sign duration by 10%.
Sell to the highest bidder.
There is a huge difference between certain merchants on what they are willing to pay for your goods. Shop around first. Try to get the best price you can before selling your hard earned loot. The difference between 1 "vs" 3 for certain herbs can mean the difference of 50 or 150 for the same lot.
Never pay to sleep.
Never pay to sleep somewhere unless you have no alternative. Inns are a rip-off, some even more so than others. There is almost never any reason to pay for accommodation in the game, someone will always put you up for free. Occasionally, some of your would-be hosts stray from their homes, but usually someone is home at any given time.
Sleep for free in Chapter V.
and of course, there are always campfires (except in the Trade Quarter, unless, of course, you go into the Sewers or in the slum in front of Hairy Bear inn).
Never buy expensive items.
Do you hate that the merchants are ripping you off? Why are the items so expensive? Are they really worth that much? Always think twice before you buy an item. Some items are actually of very little value in the game. For example, the Excellent Leather Jacket is actually considered a rip off by many players. It costs 5000 and does not actually provide a very large enhancement to Geralt's armor. For potion bases, a standard base is sufficient, because you can always make White Gull for potions which require higher quality bases.
Additionally, never buy a weapon unless there is no other way to acquire it. Most of the better weapons in the game are received as rewards for quests or good deeds. One "good" sword which can only be purchased is Gwalhir.
Buy as few books as possible.
You can get most of the information regarding plants and monsters by giving gifts you have found and stored to "old women", who are not to be confused with "beggars" or "old peasant women". There are also some very useful morsels of information gleaned from more major characters: for example, the gardener, Shani, some guards, etc. Basically talk to absolutely everyone before you contemplate buying a book. The entries you still can not get using these tips still have to come from books, but this eliminates at least half the books you will have to buy.
Also, if you feel you have enough cash and are not using monster parts to supplement your income, I believe you can get all the bestiary entries necessary to complete any contract quest in the same manner. The information can be obtained in the same Chapter as the contract quest (some even from earlier Chapters). Waiting to get the bestiary entries for free "can" cramp your style a tiny bit. For example, in Chapter III where you can kill many, many alps, the bestiary entry is only available from a book, but in Chapter IV, it can be obtained in exchange for food.
List of free books by Chapter.
In convenient sortable table format, here is a list of all the books in the game. Just click on the "Free" column to see in which Chapter a book becomes available for free.
Pick up and sell everything.
Well OK, not everything, some things you will need to keep. But you get the idea. Raid all containers (and I do mean all) and once you have decided what to keep, store what you need and sell everything else.
Additionally, and especially in Chapter III, any areas that were accessible in previous acts that remain accessible have been restocked. So you can have a second look around the Temple Quarter and the Swamp making sure to check all the containers again. There are new containers there as well.
Never pass up an opportunity to raid a corpse/remains.
or Pick up and KEEP everything.
There is another way to be thrifty that applies to almost all RPGs. Keep everything you pick up until you know for sure you can get more for free. Never buy anything unless you are sure you can not get it for free. Since there is a huge discrepancy between buying/selling prices in most games, it is just not economical to go out and buy stuff every time you need something for a quest or what not.
Most of the time, you just never know what you are going to need in a game unless you have already played it once through. Therefore, keep all the rare (stuff you have never seen before), uncommon (seen it once or twice) and some multiples of common items. If you are not sure if you need it or not, keep it.
In terms of Witcher, here is the rule of thumb for what to keep:
That should be about it. You do not really need to remember an extensive list of items that you are required to keep if you can just remember a few simple numbers. That makes everything easier to deal with and you will not have to worry too much about money any more.
Use teleportation.
Why pay the ferryman every time you go to or come back from the swamp? In Chapter II, go see Kalkstein early and get the teleportation crystal from him. Then, at least you can "come back" from the swamp for free (and from a couple of places in the sewer if need be).
In Chapter III, you get the use of four teleporters:
No more being nickeled and dimed by the ferryman.
Play a lot of poker.
Play poker. Lots of poker. Save before each game, and if you lose, restore. Always bid the highest amount even if you have a bad hand (so to speak), as it will give the most profit if you do win and lose nothing when you lost (since you will reload file anyway). In Chapter II, Thaler will play as long as you want to, as will Chireadan in Chapter IV. Velerad is a reckless bettor (even if he will not play more than a couple games at one sitting). The quickest way to earn a lot of gold in Chapter III is by playing with Roderick de Wett, found on the upper floor of the guardhouse in the Trade Quarter. Bet the highest amount you can with de Wett at every opportunity you get - more often than not, you may win (that means anywhere up to around one thousand (1000) orens, best case, in one game!).
Players do run out of gold eventually, but leaving the area and returning seems to reset this condition, so any opponent is a potentially infinite pot of gold. See Dice poker players for a full list of possible opponents.
Another way to make money at poker is by play against Merchants. You can purchase as many things as you want from the Merchants (that play poker), and you can just promptly win all your money back. Then you are more than welcome to sell everything you do not need to the highest bidder. This works well because most of the poker players' money is capped at a certain amount, so buying things from them will increase their cap, therefore making every single game much more profitable. You basically get things for free!
Indulge in a bit of fistfighting.
Yes, work out some of those frustrations on the local thugs. Save before each fight, if you are unsure of your prowess. You can bet up to 20 Orens with any generic "Fist fighter" (with base bet 10 Orens) and up to 50 Orens with any generic "Tough fist fighter" (with base bet 20 Orens), so do not settle for the base bet amount! It is easy and fun, just hit, duck, repeat. And never take the cash (or worse, booze) pay out if you are fighting the prize (named) fighters, jewellery and/or rune stones are always worth more.
Trade food for roses.
In Chapter II and III you will be able to trade all the useless food — found while looting Vizima — for roses when talking to the Gardener (near Saint Lebioda's Hospital in the Temple Quarter) about the war. This way you can get rid of all your 1 food (berries and such), to then sell the roses for 6 .
Tips Based on chapters.
Chapter 1.
In order to increase your loot, on the Attribute tree, in Intelligence part, get "Monster Lore" attribute. It gives bestiary and related ingredient entries for Barghest, Ghoul, Graveir, and Drowner immediately.
Do not allow the Scoia'tael to take the goods in "Strangers in the Night" quest. Quest rewards might look like game is rewarding you but actually in the next chapter, game punishes you for helping terrorists.
If you help the Scoia'tael, you get 200 Orens from them, Golan Vivaldi does not get arrested and Coleman eventually dies.
If Golan Vivaldi does not get arrested, you have to pay him 400 Orens to buy the books named "The Secret Gates" and "Ain Soph Aur". If he gets arrested, you pay 200 Orens for his release and get the books for free.
If you help the Scoia'tael, after you visit the detective/private-eye, Coleman dies. Depending on your timing, this might cause you to lose 2 quests.
Also, Coleman is the only character who buys fisstech. After Jethro asks you for powder (fisstech), Salamandra members start dropping fisstech. You can sell them to Coleman so long as he lives. Otherwise fisstech is useless and you lose the chance to get a couple hundred Orens.
Chapter 2.
When Raymond Maarloeve ask you about Salamandra, answer with the option mentioning Azar Javed. It saves you from paying 100 Orens.
Delivering Yaevinn's letter properly opens trade with the dwarven blacksmith who gives the lightning rod for a cheaper price. If you do not like the Scoia'tael, after getting the rod, you can help the Order in the "Force Recon" quest and open the trade with the Order merchant again.
In The Sentry quest, do not pay anything to the Druids for a rain storm. That is one of the biggest rip-offs in the game. Because even the slightest bit of rain is enough to continue the quest. Place the lightning rod as soon as you see a rainy weather and quest will continue.
When you activate the stone pylons in clockwise order, anybody or anything staying inside the triangle will get hit with a lightning (If nothing is inside you will get hit and die). When the fight is over and your helpers do not have an enemy to focus, you can use this to kill the fighters of your side without any repercussions and loot them.
If you are not that interested about Vitality, in order to increase your loot, on the Attribute tree, in Intelligence part, get "Ingredient Extraction" attribute. It doubles the most common loot monsters drop. For example, one Drowner starts providing 2 Drowner brain tissue.
You can play Dice Poker with Thaler as much as you want. However he is the luckiest player in Chapter 2. Make sure to save your game before asking for Poker. Also it is impossible to defeat him twice in a row without putting anything else between the games. If you ask for a second game right after winning, you will lose.

1. My friend Kalkstein considers himself an alchemist.
1. "Metamorphosis"... not bad.
2. Kalkstein denies that all substances are co-dependent. His hypothesis pertains to primary substances only.
1. Secondary substances don't appear of themselves. The distinction is justified.
2. After transmutation, substances continue to attach and detach from the chain. There are always six.
3. According to Kalkstein's theories, you could construct a golem.

Petri

Throughout his life, the mage Petri sought a way to strengthen his magical powers. He failed in this endeavour, but several interesting potions came about through his attempts. One of these, known as Petri's Philter, is useful to witchers with magical skills. Witchers who prefer hand-to-hand combat rarely use Petri's Philter, however, especially since it is highly toxic and thus renders the use of any other potions impossible.

Old manor catacombs

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The Old Manor catacombs are (not surprisingly) located under the Old Manor. Sarcophagi and scattered human remains still litter the place, along with sewant mushrooms. Time has not stopped here, either, and the rocks and rubble have cut off some of the passages. Alas, some of the dead refuse to remain that way, and wraiths, vampires and necrophages of all kinds eagerly greet anyone who sets a foot inside.
But even those did not stop Salamandra from sneaking in to claim this no-man's-land for their own, and letting the mutants, the results of their experiments conducted in the laboratory, run loose.
Depending on the path Geralt has chosen at this point, he will enter the catacombs with the help of either Yaevinn, Siegfried or Triss and the entrance itself will vary (see the map below). There are also strategically locked doors or caved-in areas which force the witcher take a particular (a unique) path from his start point to his ultimate goal: the laboratory.

The Physiologus is an ancient tome handed down from one village wise woman to the next. It contains descriptions and illustrations of all the monsters known at the time it was written, and how to deal with them, despite often not being comprehensive or accurate, due to the disreputable source.
History.
Around the 1240s, Geralt of Rivia obtained a copy as part of the reward he received for "dealing" with the deovel that was bothering the village of Lower Posada.
Giancardi Molnar also had a copy of the "Physiologus" in his bank in Gors Velen. In July 1267, he lent it to Ciri to read; to keep her busy as he discussed important matters with Yennefer.
Known entries.
The behaviour of the unicorn is greatly mystifying. Although exceptionally timid and fearful of people, if it should chance upon a maiden who has not had carnal relations with a man it will at once run to her, kneel before her and, without any fear whatsoever, lay its head in her lap. It is said that in the dim and distant past there were maidens who made a veritable practice of this. They remained unmarried and in abstinence for many years in order to be employed by hunters as a lure for unicorns. It soon transpired, however, that the unicorn only approached youthful maidens, paying absolutely no attention to older ones. Being a wise creature, the unicorn indubitably knows that remaining too long in the state of maidenhood is suspicious and counter to the natural order. - Entry on unicorns, pg. 253 "Time of Contempt" (U.K. edition)

Vedymin

Though the widespread term is witcher, some common folk and realms also use the names vedymin or witchman.
Physiologus entry.
 A witchman, mumbled the woman. Called by some a witcher. To summon him is most dangerous, albeit one must; for when against the monster and the vermin there be no aid, the witchman can contrive. But careful one must be—...Eeee... But careful one must be to touch not the witchman, for thus the mange can one acquire. And lasses do from him hide away, for lustful the witchman is above all measure—...—though the witchman greatly covetous and greedy for gold be, mumbled the old woman, half-closing her eyes, giveth ye not such a one more than: for a drowner, one silver penny or three halves; for a werecat, silver pennies two; for a plumard, silver pennies— pg. 180, "The Last Wish" (UK edition)
 "The witchmen, or witchers as the Nordlings call them, are a secret, elite caste of soldier-priests, likely an offshoot of the druids. Gifted, in the popular imagination, of magical powers and superhuman abilities, they were driven to take part in the struggle against evil spirits, monsters and all the dark forces. In reality, masters of weaponry, these witchmen were used by Northern sovereigns for tribal altercations to which the latter were prone. During combat, the witchmen entered trances, trances they themselves summoned, one would suppose through some sort of self-hypnosis or some method of intoxication. They fought with a blind energy, for they were completely impervious to pain or even serious injury, which attested to their supernatural strength. The theory that witchmen were the result of genetic mutation or engineering was never confirmed. The witchmen are the heroes of numerous Nordling legends (see F. Delannoy, "Myths and Legends of the Nordlings")."

In the original game, the term used was witchman. This following journal entry is, in fact, a slightly paraphrased quote from the short story "The Edge of the World".
 "A witchman is by some called a witcher. Summoning him is dangerous, yet he must be called at times. When none can stand against an accursed monster, a witchman will. Do not touch the witchman, for you will become mangy. Remember also to hide the lasses from him, for the witchman is lecherous beyond imagination. Though the witchman craves silver, never pay him more than the following: a silver penny for a drowner, two silver pennies for a werecat, four silver pennies for a vampire."
"".
On occasion, passing or stationed Nilfgaardian soldiers refer to protagonist - Geralt as a vedymin, expressing surprise at the presence of a witcher amongst them.

Normal potions • Mutagenic potions • Other potions
Potions are used throughout the game. There are the so-called "normal" potions, mutagenic potions and a few others. They can be used to increase the regeneration rate of character statistics like vitality and endurance, or they can be used to temporarily increase the base amount of those same statistics. They can also be used to nullify effects like toxicity or drunkenness, or to see in the dark.
Potion toxicity.
The ratings below are out of 100
The only way to reduce the toxicity of consumed potions and maintain their intended effects, is to only use ingredients with the same secondary substance: Albedo.
Meditating for 1 hour is sometimes enough to get rid of all toxicity in Geralt's body, enabling the player to keep effects of potions that last more than 1 hour with no toxicity in order to drink other potions.

<doc id="4425" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4425" title="Albedo">
Albedo

"The Witcher".
Albedo is an additional, or secondary substance which is present in some alchemical ingredients in addition to the primary substance. All alchemical ingredients contain one of six basic substances: aether, hydragenum, quebrith, rebis, vermilion, and vitriol. There are also three additional substances: albedo, nigredo, and rubedo. Any given ingredient may contain only a single basic substance and potentially one additional, or secondary substance.
Albedo potions: If all ingredients used to create a given potion contain albedo as an additional substance, the created potion and any subsequently imbibed potions for 1 hour have reduced toxicity by 1 scale. Meaning if the potion has High toxicity it is reduced to Medium toxicity. Potions with Low toxicity like Cat and Wives' Tears become Non-toxic just like White Honey.

Rubedo

"The Witcher".
Rubedo is an additional, or secondary substance which is present in some alchemical ingredients in addition to the primary substance. All alchemical ingredients contain one of six basic substances: aether, hydragenum, quebrith, rebis, vermilion, and vitriol. There are also three additional substances: albedo, nigredo, and rubedo. Any given ingredient may contain only a single basic substance and potentially one additional, or secondary substance.
Rubedo potions: If all ingredients used to create a given potion contain rubedo as an additional substance, the resulting potion will increase the regeneration rate of vitality for 4 hours in addition to the potion's original effect.

An Invitation to Magic is a book in "The Witcher".
An Invitation to Magic"by Anabelle Radfind"
"Magic is an incarnation of Chaos, a key which opens forbidden doors to nightmares, to the powers of pure Evil capable of annihilating the entire world. Do you not fear magic? Do you still want to tame it, to wield it?"
"Know then that magic is a talent given only to the chosen few. Have you found this talent within you? Do you want to tap into this source?"
"Know then that years of intensive study await you. You must gain extensive knowledge and constantly sharpen your mind. Creative magic is not witcher Signs and parlor tricks. Magic is an Art."
"Once you learn to control the Art, you will gain power over fire, water, earth and air. Power over people's minds. Power over yourself."
An Invitation to Magic"by Anabelle Radfind"
"A dwimveandra is a young sorceress who practices on the road, much like a journeyman artisan. After finishing their education at Aretuza, some girls decide not to become apprenticed to a specific mistress, but instead embark on a journey, allowing them to train with various sorcerers. After spending several years on this atypical internship, a dwimveandra may apply for an exam which will verify the abilities she has gained. Passing the exam grants her the title of Mistress of Magic."

The Aftermath of the War"Jurga of Maribor"
"It should be stated clearly and plainly: the order created after the war with Nilfgaard is no order. It is a mess. Kings still tremble before the might of the Black Ones, Nilfgaard still threatens the North. Sorceresses and spies work from the shadows, pulling puppet strings. Monsters roam the roads, while soldiers do what they want and oppress simple folk. A mess, I say."
"Amongst all the dangers, two are especially significant. The first comes from the nonhumans, who have assimilated only superficially. Nilfgaard has given the elves hope for a rebirth, it has placed swords in their hands and a slogan on their lips. We will know no peace while nonhumans walk the earth. The second resides in new religious movements. Only a few years ago the cult of the Eternal Fire was laughed at: how can one worship fire? Some mocked it, saying: "Maybe we should start worshiping mud or the winds?" They now bow their heads before the might of the Order and demonstrate themselves to be zealous neophytes."
"Fundamentalism has always drawn strength from hypocrisy and ignorance. Never before in history, however, has there been so much on which to draw."
"What then can an ordinary man do in such turbulent times? Maintain his integrity and decency — that's what."

The History of the World

The History of the World (Polish: "Historia świata") is a multi-volume book by Roderick de Novembre. It is a monumental though somewhat vague retelling of the history of the world — from ancient times to the present day, including details of Falka and her rebellion. This was one of the students' favorite readings at the Oxenfurt Academy, though many, such as Dandelion, consider it to be somewhat controversial and anachronistic, or at least bias toward the human perspective.
In 1267, it was one of the tomes that Ciri read in Ellander while she was studying with Yennefer at the Temple of Melitele.
Known entries.
When the fire was lit at the foot of the criminal's pyre and the flames began to engulf her, she began to hurl abuse at the knights, barons, sorcerers and lord councillors gathered in the square; using such words that terror seized them all. Although at first only damp logs were placed on the pyre, in order that the she-devil would not perish quickly and would know the full agony of fire, now came the order to throw on more dry sticks and put an end to the torture as quickly as possible. However, a veritable demon had entered the accursed one; for although she was already sizzling well, she uttered no cries of anguish, but instead began to hurl even more awful abuse. 'An avenger will be born of my blood,' she cried. 'From my tainted Elder Blood will be born the avenger of the nations and of the world! He will avenge my torment! Death, death and vengeance to all of you and your kin!' Only this much was she able to cry out before the flame consumed her. Thus perished Falka; such was her punishment for spilling innocent blood.Roderick de Novembre, "The History of the World" Volume II pg. 287, "Time of Contempt" (U.K. edition)

The History of the World"by Roderick de Novembre"
""When the criminal's stake had been lit and the flames reached her, she began insulting all the knights, barons, mages and councilors gathered in the square in such foul language that they were all filled with dread. Though wet logs had been stacked to prevent the hag from burning too quickly and provide her a chance to suffer in the flames, dry wood was soon added to the fire to end the execution more swiftly."
"She must truly have harbored a demon inside her as she uttered not a single scream though she sizzled fair enough. Instead, she began cursing horribly."
""An avenger shall be born from my own blood," she cried. "From the defiled Elder Blood, a destroyer of nations and worlds will rise! He shall avenge my torment! Death, death and revenge upon you and your offspring!" That was all she managed to articulate before she perished. Such was the death of Falka, her punishment for the innocent blood she had spilled.""

It can also be purchased from Marcus T.K. Hodgson and the books merchant in Hierarch Square.
"Human life requires three things for its sustenance - food, drink, and gossip. It is thus no wonder that no matter where I travel, be it ice-bound Poviss or ever green Toussaint, everyone asks me about the passions that bind Geralt the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg. As a man both cautious and discreet, I refuse to betray their secrets - with one important exception. The history of their first encounter is so extraordinary, so romantic and moving, that it would be a veritable crime to hide its light beneath a bushel basket. Indeed, had I not witnessed these events in person, I would never believe there was room in our grim and and dark world for such fantastic marvels."
"It all began when Geralt and I were feeling a bit peckish and, unburdened by heavy coin pouches, decided to fish our supper out of a lake. No bites were to be had, but we did not leave empty-handed - my hook snagged quite a lovely little pot. Oblivious to my friend's warnings, I opened it - and in doing so freed a powerful djinn."
"Without giving it much thought I set about proclaiming my wishes. Before I could get to three, however, the djinn - irritated, I see now in hindsight, at being issued demands so soon after waking - began to throttle me. Geralt was able to drive him off, but I was left in a sorry state. I acted, the witcher told me later, as though under the influence of some curse. Clearly, the help of an expert in the magic arcana would be needed."
"It was our good fortune that Yennefer of Vengerberg happened to be staying in a nearby village. Geralt went to her to ask that she heal his best friend, who happened also to be the brightest star in the North's poetic firmament. Yennefer, however, was more interested in the djinn (which she wanted to trap into magic servitude) than in its victim, and, it should be said, played the witcher like a well-strung mandolin. Yet rather than grow angry at being used in such a calculating manner, he fell white head over muddy boots in love with her."
"What happened then... well, I won't go into details, suffice to say that Yennefer's plans hardly delighted the djinn, and without its cooperation she proved unable to tame it. The sorceress would surely have met a tragic end - and taken all of Rinde along with her - had Geralt not rushed to her rescue. For once, he did not need to draw either of his blades: to send the djinn packing, he had but to pronounce the third and final wish. He could have asked for anything: wealth, fame, power... but instead he asked the djinn to bind his fate to that of the arrogant yet intriguing sorceress from Vengerberg."

The Rivian Pogrom is a book in "The Witcher".
The story of the non-human pogrom in Rivia, during which the famed Geralt of Rivia perished.
The Rivian Pogrom"Anonymous, based on eyewitness accounts"
"After the war, the people of Rivia were unhappy. Poverty was the plight of many and most believed the kings and magnates had betrayed them during the peace talks by not exacting reparations from Nilfgaard. A scapegoat was needed and as usual it was the changelings — nonhumans and witches."
"A mere spark was required to send a furious crowd into the streets. Anyone who seemed different was targeted. Dwarves, elves and those accused of using spells were all murdered. People also used the situation to settle old scores, loot and rape. I admit shamefully that few were brave enough to stand in defense of the persecuted. Among those few was the famous Geralt of Rivia, who in seeking to protect his friends was struck with a pitchfork and died. There would have been more victims if not for the intervention of Triss Merigold. The sorceress sent a powerful hailstorm down on the crowd. Only that powerful spell could stop the rioting. What happened to the body of Geralt of Rivia and those who stood by his side, I do not know."

The Secret Gates"by Ransant Alvaro"
"Old men say that long, long ago a mage lived in the swamp. He spent his days and nights pouring over his books and pipettes. They say he was seeking a stone that turns lead into gold and springs water into moonshine; in other words, a stone that sublimates all matter."
"The Gods were not pleased because his pride would reach where no mortal should. Thus, one night a terrible storm struck the mage's tower down. However, he built a new one and cast spells to tame the storm. This tower stood until another dark night, the earth itself moved and toppled it. Yet he built a new one and cast spells to bind the earth itself."
"And so neither heaven nor earth could harm the mage. Then one day, he disappeared. Some say he took on an apprentice and this brought him to his doom, others claim a woman was his undoing, yet others that his own creations turned against the mage. In any case, the tower stands locked and guards its secrets, and what lurks inside, nobody knows."

The Witcher merchants

There are many merchants that Geralt encounters in his travels through Vizima and its surroundings. Some are specialists, others are generalists, and a few are just opportunists.
 
Journal entry.
This journal entry pertains only to one of two mutually exclusive encounters that Geralt has in the Trade Quarter with a noblewoman.
"Vizima's Trade Quarter - rich townspeople with sophisticated tastes and knowledge of the newest fashions."
The first is a woman in a (over a white chemise, with purple trim on her headdress), found near the jester on John Natalis Square. She wants you to prove your manliness, either by presenting her with a kikimore claw or by offering her an insultingly low fee (0 works). The other option is a (possibly drunk) woman in , near the town hall, who uses a "missing" silk scarf to start a conversation with the witcher.

Merchant Street

Merchant Street is the market area in the Temple Quarter where you can easily buy and sell items of all kinds. It occupies the northeast corner of the Quarter. The central architectural feature would be the statue of the aesculapian snake. There are four merchants which can be found there regularly.
The Market.
The Peddler.
He buys and sells
He looks just like the trader from Novigrad who gave Geralt 100 in Chapter I. He is very friendly and the earliest to arrive in the mornings, as well as the last to leave at night (if he actually leaves at all!). He can be found daily from 06:00-23:00, but his business hours are shorter — he will not sell before 07:00.
The Peasant trader.
He buys and sells
He looks just like Butter Bean. He is not as talkative as the Peddler, but he is there to trade, and trade he does. The peasant trader is the first to leave in the evenings, leaving at 18:00, but he does arrive early in the mornings.
The Antiquary.
He buys and sells
He seems to be the merchant with the best sense of humour on the street, but he is the latest to arrive in the mornings and one of the first to leave in the evenings. His knowledge of books is impressive. He can recall the smallest details off the top of his head, not to mention the location of books he does not own yet. He looks just like Munro Bruys and can be found daily between the hours of 09:00 and 21:00.
The Herbalist.
She buys and sells
The Herbalist is quite cagey about where she gets her merchandise, but she can be persuaded. She will tell Geralt about gathering herbs by moonlight in the swamp in exchange for a Red shawl. She keeps fairly standard hours, daily at the market, but beware, she does not give the best prices when selling herbs.

Eager Thighs brothel

The Eager Thighs Brothel can be found in the slums of the Temple Quarter in Vizima, around the corner from The Hairy Bear. It is the place of business of Carmen and her girls. Humble might be one word to describe the place, but barren is perhaps more accurate. One imagines that most business is conducted elsewhere, or certainly that any business conducted on the premises requires no ambiance whatsoever.

<doc id="4470" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=4470" title="Marketplace">
Marketplace

The Marketplace of the Trade Quarter is a lively place during the day: customers mill about and the buskers and bards play their instruments among the merchants' parcels, packages, stalls and enormous heaps of salt glittering in the sunlight. There are two main sections: Salt Square and Tanners Square.
Due to the state of martial law, though the normal, law abiding human traffic quiets down when the night falls, the apparent curfew does nothing to stop the kikimores and Salamandra.
Salt Square.
Here are the merchants you can meet:
"A wink, was that? Plow secrecy, all know I sell information. What'll it be?" That will be 25 , please.
"My friend Julian wishes to enter the antiques business. I wonder where he finds such goods."
Tanners Square.
Here are the merchants you can meet:
When it rains, he can be found huddled usually with a few other merchants just behind his stall, facing the blacksmith's area. He keeps regular hours.
He is one of the people who sells the excellent leather jacket. He also shares his inventory with the armorer in the square outside The New Narakort.
It seems that Count de Wett demands bejewelled hilts or pommels for his weaponry, and gems are apparently not taxed.
The Alley along the Walls.
There are other merchants about the quarter as well. On the southeastern 'ring road' (technically called the "Alley along the Walls"), you will find:

Entertainment

The city of Vizima is not without its fair share of entertainment, be it of the outdoor or indoor variety. Vizimans must have a taste for such diversions as the Trade Quarter especially seems to draw quite a number of artists. They can be found plying their trade around John Natalis Square and in the Marketplace. For an indoor show, the local taverns are happy to oblige.
Jester.
The jester can be found on John Natalis Square of the Trade Quarter during the day, juggling, doing acrobatics and telling crude jokes (read, excruciatingly bad).
He really does not have a function beyond bringing an additional touch of color to the game.
Inn and tavern entertainment.
Each inn and tavern in the game has it is own "house band". Some are smaller than others, but they are all made up of some combination of bards, flautists, violinists, buskers and drummers. Most groups of musicians have an unofficial leader who can be paid for a song or poem. Some are more fun to talk to than others, but it is always worth a listen.

Vilgefortz of Roggeveen (d. 1268) was a Kovirian mage and the de facto leader of the Chapter of the Gift and the Art, the highest ranked of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. He also had a couple other personal apprentices in the form of Rience and Lydia van Bredevoort, with the latter acting as both his assistant and personal secretary.
Biography.
Early life.
As an infant, he was abandoned by his parents and left to die in a gutter in Lan Exeter. He was found and raised by druids of the Kovir Circle, and later during certain druidical rituals, his magical gifts were discovered. By accident, a mage visited them. He offered to take Vilgefortz and teach him, feeling his magical energy, though Vilgefortz refused his offer. Later he left the druids, and traveled over the world. He served as a mercenary, and later as a spy, leading him down a dark path as a marauder, robber, rapist, murderer, and finally fugitive fleeing the noose. In the end, he was running to the other end of the world, where he met a sorceress. He had a short romance with her, yet after he grew tired of her personality, he left her and joined the Brotherhood.
In fact, he was not only incredibly ambitious and power-hungry, but also secretly in league with Emhyr var Emreis, the Emperor of Nilfgaard. This had begun many years before the wars, while Emhyr was still hiding under the alias of Duny. Vilgefortz's thirst for unlimited power brought him to the conclusion that he needed the blood of Duny's daughter, Ciri, in order to claim her powers because she was a descendant of Lara Dorren. Using intrigues and his genial intellect, he helped Emhyr rise to the throne. In exchange, Emhyr promised him the North, once it was taken over.
After he recruited Rience, at some point he had to free him from the dungeons of Cintra. His apprentice had been captured for unpaid debts, so Vilgefortz paid them off anonymously at a local bank.
First Northern War.
In 1263, during the First Northern War, Vilgefortz led the Brotherhood of Sorcerers in the Battle of Sodden Hill. After the battle, he engineered the truce between the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire.
Interwar period.
After the news of Cintra's defeat, Vilgefortz instructed Rience to search for the newly orphaned Ciri, and introduced him to the Michelet brothers who could help him kill Geralt.
In 1267, he heard news of the northern rulers secret meeting at Hagge. Later he was told again by Artaud Terranova, joined by Lydia van Bredevoort and Tissaia de Vries, who all met in the workshop where Vilgefortz proposed they hold a meeting of the court mages serving northern kings, in an attempt to stop a second war and protect the truce. While dealing with the subject of Yennefer of Vengerberg, Vilgefortz asked Tissaia to send her a personal letter, as the council believed Geralt was dead, or soon to be killed, and she was non-contactable via telepathy.
" (...) Observe the man escorting her. He's Vilgefortz of Roggeveen and he really is young. But incredibly talented."In the case of sorcerers, as Geralt knew, the term 'young' covered any age up to and including a hundred years. Vilgefortz looked thirty-five. He was tall and well-built, wore a short jerkin of a knightly cut - but without a coat of arms, naturally. He was also fiendishly handsome. It made a great impression... pg. 117, "Time of Contempt" (U.K. edition)
Thanedd coup.
During the meeting of the mages on Thanedd Island on the last night of June, he accompanied Francesca Findabair. Later, he and Lydia found Geralt, and they went for a walk through the Gallery of Glory, discussing history in a rather philosophical manner. After Lydia left the two, Vilgefortz proposed a truce; join the Nilfgaardian traitors or live on the run under their rule. The witcher remained calm and declined his offer due to his political neutrality.
During the night, he (among others) was accused of treason and put in dimeritium shackles. However, due to actions of Tissaia de Vries (who was acting only in a manner she considered fair and impartial) he broke free and tried to capture Ciri. During his way, he encountered Geralt. Vilgefortz seemingly didn't use magic, instead he attacked Geralt with a staff. Vilgefortz easily defeated Geralt, leaving him alive for the beating to be taken as a 'lecture'. He continued tracing Ciri but she fled through the portal in Tor Lara, then the portal exploded and caused him a serious wound on his face (he lost one eye). Afterwards he hid in his castle, continuing his schemes to find and capture the girl, including hiring the bountyhunter Leo Bonhart. He planned to use Ciri's blood and use it on himself. During his search, the spy Dijkstra encountered the horrible experiments Vilgefortz has done on girls.
Later, he imprisoned Yennefer and tortured her to retrieve the location of Geralt and Ciri; he then applied dimeritium cuffs to Yennefer to prevent her from escaping and locked her in a cell.
During the attack at Stygga Castle he met and fought Geralt and Yennefer. Yennefer, who had just endured a period of intense torture, was no match for his magical abilities and was defeated by him. Then the vampire Regis attacked, scratching Vilgefortz just under his not working eye. Vilgefortz ignited the vampire, and engaged in a melee duel with Geralt. Vilgefortz was winning once again, until Geralt gained the upper hand thanks to the shock Vilgefortz suffered when the witcher dodged his attack with a high-level illusion. (The illusion was not Geralt's doing, it was thanks to an amulet he received). Geralt promptly beheaded the sorcerer, putting an end to Vilgefortz for good.
Appearance and personality.
Vilgefortz appeared young and very handsome, and was tall and well-built. He possessed a sincere and honest voice, and was incredibly talented with magic.
After the portal in Tor Lara exploded, Vilgefortz received a large, disfiguring burn on his face and he lost his eye. In place of his eye, he used a precious stone which allowed him to see with the use of magic.

Coleman was known as a "white death merchant" by the elves. He worked for Ramsmeat, dealing fisstech and was the intended recipient of the parcel Haren Brogg gave to Geralt in Chapter I, until it is "confiscated" by Jethro. He can be found in the back room of The Hairy Bear with Ramsmeat, in the Temple Quarter, or just outside the western gate on the dike.
Coleman also happened to be Vincent Meis' informant. Geralt can choose to turn him in or not.
Depending on whether or not Geralt allowed the Scoia'tael to take the weapons from Haren Brogg's crates in the Outskirts, Coleman could wind up on the wrong end of an elven arrow, but this only happens after Geralt begins investigating with Raymond.

Gramps is an old cannibal who lives in the island hut in the northeast part of the swamp. Geralt first meets him near the landing. When he asks if Gramps has any witcher's work, he is offered the opportunity to escort the old man to Melitele's Shrine. Geralt points out that he was hoping for "paid" work, but takes the job anyway. (There is the option to tell Gramps to "piss off".)
He is especially partial to elf meat, but finds dwarf meat (at least he "thinks" it was a dwarf he fought a drowner for) too stringy. He also has some standards: he never eats children. I guess that is "some" comfort.
During the first phase of Flowers and Gold, if Geralt asks him about beggartick, Gramps will give him the formula for Perfume. He also keeps a copy of Ain Soph Aur in an old bookcase at his house. If Geralt chooses to spare him, he will provide the formula for Hanged Man's Venom.

Agnes of Glanville was the first human woman to become a sorceress and a master of air-based magic. She was a founding member of the first Chapter of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, and the author of "The Secret of Secrets".
Biography.
First Landing.
Around the 760s, Agnes was born to two settlers that arrived in the First Landing and grew up in the first human settlement. Jan Bekker and Giambattista later selected her to undergo magical tests to deduce whether she was a Source. After it was confirmed, she was taken with the other Sources to Mirthe, the first seat of mages, to start training. Emotional from her detachment with her mother, she formed a connection with Giambattista.
Formation of the Chapter.
In the late half of the 9th century, the first Chapter was installed and their magical laws enacted by Agnes, Herbert Stammelford, Aurora Henson, Ivo Richert, Geoffrey Monck and Radmir of Tor Carnedd. Many mages did not conform to their laws, and so a bloody war broke out, Raffard the White being a casualty.

Philippa Eilhart (Polish: "Filippa Eilhart") was a sorceress and King Vizimir II's advisor, who remained a powerful figure at Redania's court even after his death, for which she was likely responsible. She was one of the few mages with the rare ability to polymorph, and was able to turn at will into a large grey owl.
She led the Thanedd coup against the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, intending to neutralize suspected traitors allied with Nilfgaard. Later, she initiated the founding of the Lodge of Sorceresses and was considered its leader. The all female organization secretly met at Montecalvo, Philippa's home base.
She was one of the victims of the Witch Hunts in the 1270s, having been tortured and killed by Archpriest Willemer's men. Many years later, she was exonerated and canonized as Martyr Saint.
Biography.
Early life.
Philippa studied magic under the auspices of Tissaia de Vries, probably at Aretuza, the magical school for sorceresses on Thanedd Island. She would later claim the position of a royal advisor at the court of Vizimir II, King of Redania, as well as a seat on the Council of Wizards, one of the two ruling bodies of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, which governed and guided magical use and practice in the Northern Kingdoms.
First Northern War.
In 1263, during the First Northern War, Philippa travelled with the Brotherhood of Sorcerers to Lower Sodden, where they fought alongside northern armies in the Battle of Sodden Hill, against the Nilfgaardian Army.
Hunt for Rience.
In 1267, she had a strong relationship with Sigismund Dijkstra, head of the Redanian Intelligence, the two having previously been lovers for three years, and was present at his meeting with Dandelion in Oxenfurt, discussing the location of Geralt of Rivia. She pushed Dandelion for information on Ciri, under the pretense of being worried for her safety, though Dijsktra considered this a hasty move.
Later that night, as an owl she followed Dandelion back to Wolfgang Amadeus Goatbeard's house, a friend of the bards, where she found Geralt, Dandelion and the medic Shani. They discussed Geralt's position of danger in Oxenfurt, and then when the topic of Rience came up, Shani revealed she had met him three days previous, at the shop of a local merchant Myhrman. The four went to the shop, and at the gate Shani lured the man out so he would let down the drawbridge and Geralt knocked him out. After Shani and Geralt attempted to persuade him, Philippa grew angry and turned to torture, using painful magic that led them to the location of an amulet that could summon Rience.
At dawn, after Geralt had found Rience and incapacitated the four Michelet brothers, Philippa found Toublanc Michelet laying dying on the ground. Whispering words of comfort, she was able to deduce that Vilgefortz had recommended the brothers to Rience, revealing the corruption in the brotherhood. She mercilessly finished him off with a stiletto and ran after Geralt and Rience. The two were fighting and as Geralt went to stab Rience, Philippa paralyzed the witcher, allowing Rience to escape through a portal, and partially explained her reasoning.
Thanedd coup.
On the last night of June, she travelled with Dijkstra to Thanedd Island for the Grand Mage's Conclave. That evening, at the banquet, they briefly talked with Yennefer and Geralt about Sabrina Glevissig and her alliance to Henselt. Later she found Geralt again and they spoke about politics until interrupted by Keira Metz.
In the early hours of the morning, Philippa rallied several of the Northern supporters and began to arrest those allied with Nilfgaard. After they were all rounded up, Dijsktra and Keira brought a magically blinded Geralt to Philippa, who restored his eyesight and gave Dijkstra a list of traitors within Redania, found in Vilgefortz's office. The traitors were then led by Radcliffe to Garstang to face trial. Within the palace, Tissaia de Vries let out the Nilfgaardian traitors and a fight broke out between both sides. After Philippa managed to flee the conflict, she polymorphed into an owl and found Ciri being attacked by Artaud Terranova, whom she scratched his eyes deep with her talons, and Geralt finished him off. Believing herself in debt to Geralt for the escape of Rience, she allowed the two of them to flee without the council following, and then fled Thanedd herself back to Redania.
After returning to Tretogor with several other mages left displaced by their rulers newfound hostility, such as Triss Merigold, Keira Metz, and Margarita Laux-Antille, she learnt of Vizimir's assassination the same night as the coup, and so attempted to assist Queen Hedwig in gaining control of the kingdom from her castle, Montecalvo.
Formation of the Lodge.
On August 5th, the four used a projection spell to begin their first true meeting, mainly around recruitment and their purpose, summoning Assire var Anahid, Sabrina Glevissig, Sheala de Tancarville, and Francesca Findabair. Philippa led the meeting and helped diffuse the tension created after Francesca joined, between her and Sabrina. Despite initial disagreements over the events of Thanedd, they agreed to work together to protect the safe practice of magic. Backed by Margarita's evidence of women performing better with magic (based off comparing pupils from Aretuza and Ban Ard), they agreed women would only be allowed to join, and also the sorceresses would not have to be apolitical.
Appearance and personality.
Philippa was described as attractive but intimidating by Dandelion, who thinks of her (perhaps using his signature hyperbole) as being "no less than three hundred years old" by 1267. She had dark hair and black eyes, and was known to favour black agate jewelry. She often wore practical traveling outfits when the need required, however to more to formal events, such as the Thanned banquet, she wore a dress lined with diamonds and ermine fur. She also used crimson coloured lipstick, and cinnamon and muskroot perfume.
Philippa was widely known throughout the Northern Kingdoms for both her political influence at the court of King Vizimir II, as well as for her prodigal magical powers, as even Tissaia De Vries considered her to be one of her best students.
"The Witcher".
Even though Geralt never met this sorceress face to face, her name appears in conversation then and again. It is also speculated that either she or Keira Metz was speaking with Triss Merigold through the latter's magic mirror at the very beginning of Chapter III.
Philippa Eilhart maintained quarters in the dwarven town of Vergen, which she used to share with her "lover" and apprentice, a "leashed sorceress", Cynthia, as well as a house in Loc Muinne. Geralt first had an encounter with her at the end of Chapter I, using Síle's megascope while investigating the disappearance of Triss Merigold, if he aided Iorveth before the fight with Letho.
Her nightstand in her Vergeni quarters is highlighted when the Witcher's Medallion is used, though it seems inaccessible.
"This was hardly the first time Geralt and I encountered Philippa Eilhart – jewel of the court at Tretogor and once the trusted sorceress of King Vizimir II. Philippa was one of the most talented mages of those times – only a handful ever mastered the art of polymorphy. Her intellect and the influence she held at the Redanian court were not to be underestimated. Proud, independent, and extremely beautiful, as graceful in a fanciful yet elegant dress as in a man's traveling outfit, she was beyond any doubt one of the most attractive women I have ever known. Yet I would not count Philippa among the most pleasant of females, despite her indisputable though chilly charm. Her gaze alone was enough to make the most confident men shudder, and the mere thought of spending a night with her would make their flesh creep."
"At the time, Philippa Eilhart was staying in the town of Vergen as part of Saskia the Dragonslayer's inner circle. Her motives remained unclear, to say the least – the former court magician had never been known for her altruism."
"However, one cannot deny that without her help Geralt would not have found his way through the magical mist. Philippa rendered him an invaluable service at that time."
"Her qualifications in the area of curses, magic, and supernatural phenomena were undeniable. If there was anyone to help the witcher in this regard back then, it was certainly Miss Eilhart. Still, I was extremely glad that it was Geralt, and not I, who was forced to speak with the Tretogor magician."
"It was Philippa who gave the witcher the list of the ingredients for the antidote for the poison plaguing Saskia. The knowledge of recipes, ingredients, and their specific properties is always extremely helpful in learning magical arcana, and few could equal Eilhart in that regard."
"Philippa tricked everyone, not only casting a charm on Saskia under the guise of aid, but also using Geralt and Iorveth in her machinations. On the one hand, it was inevitable. On the other, it left a bitter aftertaste, giving rise to the thought that sorceresses' misdeeds are responsible for the widespread mistrust towards their profession and perhaps even towards the female gender. Eilhart abducted Saskia and left for Loc Muinne. Back then we did not know what she was planning."
 If the Kaedweni win the siege of Vergen:
"Fleeing the victorious Henselt, Philippa Eilhart moved with Síle and Saskia to Loc Muinne, where a summit of sorcerers and crowned heads was to take place."
"If Philippa Eilhart had counted on her troubles coming to end in Loc Muinne, she miscalculated. She was arrested by the Redanians just after arriving, and placed in a dungeon where she awaited the king's judgment."
"In retribution for certain events of the past, not to mention her recent activities, the sorceress was brutally blinded during an initial interrogation. Death seemed an increasingly likely prospect, and it seemed only a miracle could save her."
 If Geralt chooses to help Philippa instead of saving Triss:
"Geralt had no desire to help a magician who repaid his trust with treason, but Philippa's arguments were justified. Only she could lift the spell from Saskia, and thus the witcher was forced to trust her words once more."
"One might have thought that a blind, exhausted sorceress would have no hope of flee. Yet she seized a moment in which both her guardians were distracted and deceived them. Philippa Eilhart risked it all on one gambit and transformed into an owl, fleeing Loc Muinne. Given the presence of the vengeful Iorveth, one might say that fear gave wing to her escape plan."
"The Witcher Battle Arena".
Philippa Eilhart was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins. She was a mage class hero.
"Philippa Eilhart is a force to reckon with. Wielding immense power, she's one of the few sorceresses who possesses the ability of polymorphy"–"she can change into an owl. She specializes in area of effect attacks, and her every spell can target multiple enemies. Her passive skill makes her stronger with every kill."
"Heart of the Storm is a skill that can be used in many ways. Touch a place on the screen, and Philippa will summon a pillar of thunder which both slows down enemies, and deals damage to foes caught in its range. Additionally, the character located in the center of the spell's area of influence will be lifted into the air and immobilized, which allows Philippa's team members to launch their attacks."
"Chain Lightning is a skill of choice when you want to deal tons of damage. There's a trick to it though"–"being a channeled spell, it requires the sorceress to stand in one place during casting. This means that she can be stunned, silenced of lifted up in the air and the spell will be interrupted. The key to success is positioning!"
"Dome of Storms, Philippa's powerful special ability, turns the sorceress into an owl and casts a dome of storms around t"–"It's"[]" an immensely powerful spell which inflicts damage upon everyone who winds up within it, and speeds up Philippa's movement by 50%. Use with caution!"
Skins.
Philippa reappeared, having survived Loc Muinne, she fled to a hideout in southern Redania. In the quest Return to Crookback Bog, Geralt found a doll with obvious signs of black magic performed by the crones used to control the person this doll represents. The feathers on this doll immediately reminded Geralt of Philippa, but there was no definitive proof that the doll in fact represented her.
She contacted Margarita Laux-Antille, explaining her plan to regrow her eyes by cultivating tissues on precious stones, just as Vilgefortz did, and to revive the Lodge. Then she went to Novigrad to seek help from her former lover, the sorcerer Arthur de Vleester. Having humiliated him in the past, de Vleester convinced her she'd be safer in her owl form, and then attached a dimeritium band around her ankle. Following de Vleester's execution during the witch hunts, Philippa fell into the possession of Zoltan Chivay, who affectionately named her Poppy.
He later lost her to Sigismund Dijkstra, who made the mistake of removing her dimeritium band, and she returned to human form and attacked. Only Geralt's intervention put an end to her rampage. Philippa was then recruited to help stop the Wild Hunt in exchange for amnesty from Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. After Margarita was rescued from Oxenfurt, she and Philippa met with Ciri to offer her equal partnership in the Lodge, to which she declined.
"If Geralt choose to participate in the conspiracy to assassinate Radovid:" Philippa spied on a meeting between Geralt, Dijkstra, Roche, Ves and Thaler in her owl form. Subsequently, she changed to human form and spoke with Geralt when he left the meeting, telling him that Radovid won't take his word that he had her captive and provided him Vizimir's ring to legitimize his story. Following the deaths of Radovid's escort by Geralt and the Temerians, Radovid banged on a nearby door, only to find Philippa waiting for him. She blinded him with magic dust as payback for taking her own eyes before stabbing him in the back, killing him, after which she polymorphed into an owl and disappeared.
Philippa later assisted Geralt in seeking out the Sunstone to help in their plan to lure out the Wild Hunt. While searching through the Skellige caves, Philippa criticised Geralt for having an overprotective attitude towards Ciri, stating that the Lodge were not a pack of wolves he could scare away with his sword, to which the witcher insisted that he could because they were. Once they found the Sunstone, Geralt assumed that she would take the artifact for herself, but Philippa insisted that that was not the case. She then revealed her intentions: to take Yennefer's place at Emhyr's court and become Ciri's advisor, and hoped Geralt would take Yennefer with him and leave everything to her.
"Philippa Eilhart, one-time advisor to King Vizimir II, called the Just, member of the Council of Mages and later founder of the Lodge of Sorceresses, had played a momentous part in the history of the world as well as in Geralt's life."
"There could be no denying her talent, yet neither could one claim she did not also at times demonstrate sickly ambition. Very trustworthy reports indicated she had had a hand in King Vizimir II's death, and, as a member of the Lodge, was implicated in the murder of two other monarchs as well - Demavend of Aedirn and Foltest of Temeria."
"For this reason the one-time "Jewel of the Court at Tretogor" was now a wanted woman, the quarry of special forces from the North and Nilfgaard alike."
"Vizimir's son and successor, Radovid V, was particularly eager to capture her. During their last encounter in Loc Muinne he had had Philippa's eyes gouged out, yet she had fled and he wanted nothing more than to stick the head of "Tretegor's Jewel" on a spike above the city gates."
"Thanks to her mastery of the difficult art of polymorphy, Philippa had been able to evade her pursuers by transforming into an owl. Then she had holed up in a hideout outside Novigrad to wait out the worst."
"Everything seemed to indicate that Philippa had not only been investigating magic cures to her lost vision, but had also taken concrete steps towards the reactivation of the Lodge of Sorceresses. Her current location, however, remained unknown."
"Imagine our surprise when we learned Philippa had been right under our noses the whole time! During her flight from her pursuers she had sought shelter with an old lover and fellow mage. He must've still born a grudge, however, for he tricked her and imprisoned her in her owl form. After the with hunters carted him off, his house was plundered and the owl wound up in the hands of... our dear friend Zoltan. Sadly Triss discovered this right after Zoltan had lost the owl in a game of cards - meaning our search had to continue."
"Philippa's new "owner"? Dijkstra. Was it a coincidence that she was now in the hands of her spurned-ex-lover and hated enemy? Triss certainly didn't think so, instead suspecting the former spy had woven a gwent-centered web of subterfuge in order to settle some old score."
"Luckily for Philippa, Geralt got things under control and saved her from whatever delights Dijkstra was planning."
"Though the Lodge's prior actions were highly controversial, Philippa stubbornly worked toward its reconstitution, offering Ciri the chance to join it as a full and equal member."
If Geralt chooses to complete Reason of State:
"One can call historical justice the fact that Philippa Eilhart, Radovid's old tutor, ended the crazed monarch's life. In doing so she also exacted revenge for her blinding and the death and persecution of her fellow mages, so many of whom had died in agony on Radovid's orders."

Tissaia de Vries, originally born as Skylark, (d. July 1267) was a sorceress and a member of the Chapter of the Gift and the Art. She was one of the rectors at Aretuza and the author of "The Poisoned Source".
She had dark, smoothly combed hair, shining eyes and thin lips, often dressing in a camaca cape trimmed with dormouse fur thrown over her shoulder. She was also one of the oldest sorceresses alive during the Northern Wars, but appeared young due to magical elixirs.
Biography.
Early life.
She came from humble origins as indicated by her original name, Skylark, but this name was almost all but forgotten by everyone in favor of her using Tissaia de Vries by the time she became a powerful and respected sorceress. She would eventually become the headmistress of Aretuza, magical academy on Thanedd Island, where she would educate dozens of young sorceresses under her strict disciplinarian and firm but fair approach to teaching. 
While teaching at Aretuza, she was the one who took the young Yennefer of Vengerberg under her wing. While training her, it was Tissaia who would fix Yennefer's hunchback and cure her of her various afflictions after the young adept tried to take her own life by slitting her wrists. She would cultivate a close lifelong relationship with the younger sorceress, becoming something of a maternal figure and role model to her.
Other famous sorceresses that were specifically know to have studied under Tissaia were Philippa Eilhart and Margarita Laux-Antille. The former Tissaia would acknowledge to be her best student, although their relationship would cool over the years as Tissaia resented Philippa's cold ambition and political machinations, whereas the latter would eventually succeed her as the Rectoress of Aretuza, and remained a close friend. 
Tissaia would eventually take a seat on the Chapter, the highest chamber governing the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, the premier organization for the mages of the Northern Kingdoms, and she would be acknowledged as an Arch-mistress among her peers due to her outstanding magical power and knowledge.
Interwar period.
In 1267, she met with Artaud Terranova, Vilgefortz and Lydia van Bredevoort, and discussed the northern kings meeting at Hagge, including the political implications the event held, namely the possible plans of a second war. After being asked for his opinion, Vilgefortz ordered the council to stand back and let events unfold, as reacting too promptly to false news could be devastating. While Artaud implied Vilgefortz's word was not law, Tissaia knew he held the power and command in the Brotherhood. Vilgefortz instructed them to send word to the Masters of the Third Degree, the mages on king's councils around the north, and hold a meeting to discuss plans. Tissaia also sent a letter to Yennefer directly, as she was not contactable via telepathy.
Thanedd coup.
At the end of June, after several students escaped the academy to the main city, she was escorted back to Gors Velen by Rayla, and then she and Margarita Laux-Antille rented a room at The Silver Heron to look for them. One afternoon, she detected Ciri and Fabio Sachs on the run from an angry crowd, through the magical interference set off by Ciri's amulet. Believing her a novice of Aretuza, she scolded her for leaving the school, using the amulet, and spending time with a boy, putting a paralysis spell on the young girl. After Fabio revealed who she was, the two mages took Ciri to Giancardi Bank where Yennefer was able to confirm the young girl's identity, and then all four went back to The Silver Heron to bathe in the cellar bathhouse for several hours until Ciri fled.
After going to bed following the evening banquet in Aretuza, she was awoken by the coup taking place between Northern and Nilfgaardian supporters. As she wanted to remain neutral, she broke Garstang's magical barriers and freed the Nilfgaardian traitors from their dimeritium shackles, giving them an even fight. Later, as the Nilfgaardian attack began to break down, she became emotional and attacked several Redanian soldiers with lightning and fire, bidding them away from Garstang. She found an exausted Triss Merigold carrying the heavily wounded Geralt and teleported them away to safety, and then shortly after that, Tissaia committed suicide by slitting her wrists. Together with the other losses, her death spelled the end of the Council, making way for the Lodge of Sorceresses.

The Golem burial ground is in the north-central part of the Swamp. Notably, there are several stone golems, frozen in position scattered about the place and three very interesting posts that appear to call forth lightning when touched. One of the golems is not buried and much closer to these posts than the rest.

Located in the Swamp, the Lumberjacks' glade is where Geralt meets Yaren Bolt, the leader of the lumberjacks in the area, who are busily cutting down the remains of a primeval forest of yews to supply the local wainscoting market. On any given day, the woodcutters, a ragtag assortment of men which Yaren rules with an iron fist, go about their business, hacking at wood or sitting around the campfire chatting about lumberjacks and cross-dressing.
One of the lumberjacks in the glade is willing to sell Geralt his possessions, which include a bottle of sodden mead, a red meteorite ore and a silver ring, for 200 (150 if you haggle). He needs the cash to offset the income he will lose from logging if he goes home to be with his children who have taken ill. If Geralt does not yet have the Wives' Tears formula, he also throws that into the bargain.
Notes.
On occasion, two lumberjacks will chat to each other about the wonders of cross-dressing and hanging around in bars, which is a clear reference to The Lumberjack Song by Monty Python.

One of several caves in "The Witcher", the swamp cave is located in the southern part of the Swamp just off the road through the forest. The entrance is guarded by echinopsae. The corpse outside is not a great omen. There is a campfire, so it is not all bad, but be sure to clear out the drowners and drowned dead before trying to meditate there. In Chapter II, wolves are found there. In Chapter III, there are cockatrices and much more.
There is also what appears to be a burial chamber with a vran's sarcophogus surrounded by large obelisks that flank a path leading down to the Circle of Hanging Stones, a circle of elements for the sign Quen. The sarcophagus contains one of the sephirah as well as a nice axe.

Kreve is one of many deities worshipped by the inhabitants of the Northern Realms. In Barefield was one of the larger temples of Kreve. Kreve priests are known for their passion for creating mission and proselytizing, and the aversion of many post conjunction phenomena (monsters, magic).
On the other hand, they are able to cooperate with other religious congregations - with the Cult of Melitele and the Cult of the Eternal Fire. Besides, we do not know too much about the deity - do not even know if it was a feminine or masculine deity.
Kreve is a kind of or the of the Nordling pantheon. An expansive god, associated with such attributes as decisive action, energy, power, spontaneity, resourcefulness, expansion (in any meaning) and defense of ownership. His symbol is the thunderbolt. Most popular among soldiers, knights, monarchs, merchants and risk-takers.
The basic commandment of Kreve's followers is the fight against evil, understood both internally, as challenging oneself to fight against one's own weaknesses, and outwardly, when "evil" means anything that threatens the people's life, health, soul and property. This is the reason why Kreve's clergy are talented exorcists, but also opponents of mages and exotic, pagan or sectarian cults like Coram Agh Tera or Lilith.
They also are often prejudiced in relation to unassimilated non-humans. Kreve's military arm, Order of the White Rose founded by Hugues de Napeys, actively contributed to the extermination of Vrans and the suppression of Aelirenn's rebellion.
The Cult of Kreve is strongly associated with the cult of the Eternal Fire. Priests of Kreve often argue and carry out disputes with priestesses of Melitele but they can cooperate on important issues. Kreve's clerics are the most vehement opponents of the worshippers of Lionhead Spider.

Gifts

Gift-giving plays an important role in "The Witcher".
Gifts
"Geralt can present gifts to many of the characters in the game. Usually the recipients express their gratitude by offering useful items or information. Gifts can also help Geralt win the affections of women. The trick is to choose the right gift from Geralt's inventory. Usually, characters themselves suggest the kind of gift they would like to receive and Geralt can figure out what would make them happy based on hints. For example, peasant women like to receive flowers, while townswomen prefer jewellery or clothing. Prostitutes would rather get money, and elegant courtesans desire precious gems. It is important to remember that a badly chosen gift may insult the recipient."
Glossary entry.
In "The Witcher", gifts include:

The druids' cave is one of three refugee caves in the swamp cemetery in Chapter V. Depending on the path Geralt chose, he helped lead either Shani or Zoltan Chivay there. The druids preparing for The Green March are also there, as is Antoinette's cousin, Corbin.
The two elder druids will also buy and sell their usual complement of goods, in addition to the bartering for The Green March.

Brickmakers' quarry

Brickmakers' quarry is located in the southern part of the swamp, near the landing and the Brickmakers' village. It is where the clay pits, which provide the raw material for the bricks are found. There is also a large furnace and a vodyanoi altar. The brickmakers consider the vodyanoi to be the Water Lords. This is the area that Geralt is asked to clear of drowners by Vaska. It is also the area were Berengar's bloody belongings were found.

Brickmakers' village

Brickmakers' village is barely a hamlet. The handful of huts huddled together around the remains of the Old Road in the southeastern part of the swamp, just north of the landing are not much to look at. The brickmakers go about their daily routine, worshipping the Water Lords and making bricks in the clay pits southwest of the village. They do their best to avoid the many hazards of the swamp: the drowners, drowned dead, bloedzuigers and echinopsae. Sometimes kikimora even dare enter the village, though those usually shy away from human civilization.
Vaska's hut is the center of the village, housing a shrine to the Water Lords as well as being her place of residence.
In the area immediately adjacent to the village, there are also two mysterious, ancient obelisks, assigned to Neh'tza and Maal'kad.

Zahin Schmartz was a dwarf with a nasal condition and a dentist who moved into the house vacated by Detective Raymond Maarloeve's untimely death. He collected teeth, and sniffed a lot. During Chapter III, he could be found either at his residence, or wandering about town. He seemed to particularly enjoy chatting with the vendors on Merchant Street in the Temple Quarter. He could also be found in Old Vizima in Chapter V, inhabiting an empty (former executioner's) tower just beside the hole in the wall that leads to the swamp cemetery.

The striga's crypt is on the island in the swamp cemetery in Chapter V. It is where Princess Adda's sarcophagus is located. It also hides one of the ancient crypts, Saint Gregory's tomb. Geralt must go there to retrieve some of the necessary components of Raven's armor.
Just as the witcher arrives at the crypt, he is accosted by Velerad who begs him to go inside and try to find out more about the striga's curse and hopefully cure the princess once and for all. Naturally our hero agrees and sets off to find information and armor. Sadly this is a nasty trick and the burgomeister locks Geralt inside the crypt, leaving our hero with no choice but to spend the night with the beast.

Yaren Bolt was a dwarf and the leader of the band of woodcutters who logged the ancient yews in the Lumberjacks' glade in the Swamp. Apparently, these magnificent specimens make excellent wainscoting. He rules his crew with an iron fist, but it is for their own good. Without him, many of them might not make it back home.
He has no time for the notions of the brickmakers and views them more as trainable simpletons for his enterprise. His opinion of the vodyanoi is equally glowing.

Cemetery Island

Cemetery Island rules the scenery of the swamp cemetery, rising high above its surroundings, visible from every point. Even though the bridge that once led to the island from Old Manor has crumbled almost beyond repair, the island is far from unreachable. Thus, a few refugees from Old Vizima have set up a campfire there, preferring the many threats that populate the abandoned burial grounds: the drowners and the drowned dead, the bloedzuigers and the bruxae and the garkains. And, above all, the striga, who retreats into her crypt for the day.
There is a circle of elements, The Circle of Mute Thunder on the island, too.

Water Lords

The "Water Lords" are the object of worship among the brickmakers in the Swamp outside Vizima. Led by their village eldress, Vaska, they pray daily to their idols and leave their fates to these mysterious creatures. It is highly probable that these water lords are vodyanoi, with myths of Dagon mixed in to refer to the whole race.
The brickmakers communicate with the Water Lords via an effigy, or altar, near the clay pits. In Chapter IV, the altars to Dagon look identical to the effigies in Vaska's hut and near the clay pits.

He says Geralt should do it as dwarves are no masters of stealth.
Zoltan is one of the three possible party guests, but you should not miss out on some more fun by not exploring the other two options.

In Chapter I in the Outskirts Inn, Geralt meets Declan Leuvaarden, a rich merchant, who asks the witcher to find his missing companion, or failing that, his remains and to give them a "decent burial". The remains of Leuvaarden's companion, initially described as merely "crumbled human remains", are within the Outskirts. In fact, they can be found in an echinops-infested cavern just west of the Maribor Gates to the city of Vizima.
Once recovered, there remains the matter of the "decent burial". Here, the Reverend comes to the rescue and offers a "crumbling sarcophagus" in the crypt beneath the Chapel.

The two meet once more in Old Vizima, in Chapter V, as part of Mud and Velvet and The Bruxa Contract. Jean-Pierre is also Antoinette's fiancé, whom Geralt meets at the Royal castle.

The blacksmith is a very versatile fellow. He dabbles in many things and has wide-ranging interests, not just weapons and armour. He can be of use for forging new meteorite and rune swords and for general repairs. He also buys some surprising things for a blacksmith:

Dimeritium amulet

This amulet is a quest item which Geralt receives from Dandelion in Murky Waters. Dandelion has brought a parcel from Triss and a letter. The parcel contains a Dimeritium amulet for Alvin which is supposed to help control his magical abilities and his constant nightmares.
Depending on Alvin's previous guardian, he will either be at the "fairytale ruins" outside the village where he will have to be rescued from the Gambling Ghost, or by the riverbank with a dog, where they are both threatened by a devourer (the only one you will ever see in daytime). It takes a little convincing to get Alvin to wear the amulet:
Geralt: I have a gift for you. It's a dimeritium necklace, do you like it?Alvin: Necklaces are for girls!Geralt: It'll keep your nightmares at bay. I wear one.Alvin: An amulet like yours! "The Witcher"
However, it is not strong enough to keep him from prophesying once again. "... look into my eyes d'hoine... you are not even human... now do you see the necessity..."

"A letter to Shani enclosed in a small envelope." or "A letter to Triss enclosed in a small envelope."
Depending on Geralt's choice of guardian for Alvin in Chapter III, he either receives a letter from Shani or from Triss. He must then reply, but as with many instances in the plot of the game, Geralt has choices in the reply he dictates to Dandelion, and of course, the bard is as faithful as ever to the original text.
Later, there is the matter of getting the missive to its intended recipient. As it happens, the Fisher King also seems to be the local postmaster.
Note.
This letter, and in particular the "cool" versions, is a reference to a letter sent by Geralt to Yennefer asking her for help in teaching Ciri in "Blood of Elves". Needless to say, Yennefer is less than impressed with his choice of words and her reply while being painfully polite on the surface, is very cutting in its sarcasm.

"I know you care little for politics, but I would like you to do something. I want you to warn King Foltest about Adda. The princess is plotting with Salamandra — the king's enemy — which is why I cannot return to Vizima."

"I always believed that witchers had stripped me of the ability to communicate with humans. Now I know this to be untrue. Whatever the reasons, I cannot talk to people, so I write this letter instead. Herein, I admit: I am a coward, I fear pain, incapacitation and death. I was afraid at Kaer Morhen, afraid when I fought monsters, and finally, I feared the Professor and Azar Javed, especially the latter. He supervises Salamandra's scientific project, creating deadly creatures from black magic and mutagens. He is a powerful mage, but if my plan works, he will be a dead mage and the witchers' secrets will be safe. In spite of everything, I am content our paths crossed as I set off now for Vizima."

Maribor is the second largest city in Temeria and the capital of the region of the same name, located about 200 miles south of Vizima and roughly 42 miles southwest of Zavada.
History.
First Landing.
Maribor once was the location of an ancient Aen Seidhe settlement, which upon the great eastern expansion of humans approximately five hundred years ago, was abandoned by the elves and in its place humans built this city.
The city was later partially destroyed by the Viy of Maribor, a viy created by the mage Alzur.
Second Northern War.
During the Battle of Brenna in March 1268, which took place on a field north of the city, it was Daniel Etcheverry, count of Garramone, who led the defence of the city.

Yarpen Zigrin was a well known dwarven warrior, adventurer, dragon-hunter, and a vice-starosta of Mahakam. He was also the leader of a company of six dwarves and later a veteran of the Battle of Brenna.
Biography.
Early life.
As a youth, Yarpen and his siblings in Mahakam lived with their grandmother, who taught them medicines, generally involving simple ingredients.
An unknown time later, he became a leader of his dwarven company which included Lucas Corto, Paulie Dahlberg, Regan Dahlberg, Xavier Moran, and Yannick Brass. This group traveled the Continent and hunted large and dangerous game.
During that time, Yarpen and his company had apparently slain a dragon called Ocvist. Soon afterwards they traveled to Caingorn, where another dragon had been sighted and a hunt called. When they arrived in the kingdom, they joined the hunting party.
Hunt for a dragon.
Yarpen's group was just one of many parties participating in the hunt. Officially, the hunt was under the command of King Niedamir, but he did not really command anything. Other individuals joining the hunt were Knight Eyck of Denesle, Boholt and his Crinfrid Reavers, sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, witcher Geralt of Rivia, bard Dandelion, sorcerer Dorregaray, and last but not least, Knight Borch Three Jackdaws with his company of two Zerrikanian women (Téa and Véa). The target of the hunt was a large, female Green dragon that made a nest in the area. Shortly before the hunt commenced, the dragon was poisoned by some locals, and though seriously wounded, she survived.
Thus the hunt begun. Very soon, Yarpen made a deal with Boholt about the dragon, the killing and mainly the share of the dragon's treasure. During the hunt, they encountered many perils such as a rock slide that almost killed the sorceress and the witcher but the two were saved by Eyck. They eventually reached their goal and stood face to face with the wounded dragon, but before they could attack another dragon appeared, this time a Golden dragon. Villentretenmerth, the dragon, used his telepathy and told the party he would fight them in a fair duel. Eyck of Denesle did not hesitate and swiftly attacked but the dragon quickly defeated his foe and sent him, along with his horse, flying across the valley.
After this, the King Niedamir decided to leave. However, the Reavers and Yarpen's group agreed they would still finish the hunt and kill the golden dragon. The hunting party argued, for Geralt, Dandelion, and Dorregaray did not want to kill such a beast and were against it. Boholt and Yarpen, along with their men, quickly defeated and bound all those who opposed them. The sorceress Yennefer, who at first appeared to side with the hunters, tried to use some spells against the hunters but was knocked off by Yarpen and tied up as well. With all the opposition tied up, Yarpen's and Boholt's men attacked the dragon.
Though the golden dragon defeated them as well, the local militia arrived during the fight and attacked. The combined forces of all the men proved too much for the dragon and he began to lose. Fortunately, Yennefer, Geralt, Dandelion, and Dorregaray managed to free themselves and tried to defend the golden dragon. Likewise, Téa and Véa appeared and started to kill one man after another. Eventually, the defenders repelled the attackers and Villentretenmerth emerged victorious. He however forbade any more killing and thus the Reavers and Yarpen's group survived. It was then shown that the "treasure" the dragons were protecting so much was, in fact, a little hatchling. When the golden dragon, who was actually Knight Borch Three Jackdaws, left with his youngling, the entire hunting party dispersed and went their separate ways.
Later deeds.
Sometime after the dragon hunt, Yarpen was in the Gors Velen marketplace, when he was approached by Yennefer, who grew angry at his involvement in the hunt. Yarpen fled the city, as Yennefer was screaming and promising her later revenge.
Around 1266, Yarpen and his company were still active, though they were one man short because Lucas Corto retired in Mahakam and married. They served King Henselt of Kaedwen and were tasked to deliver a convoy of secret cargo to Aedirn. On their way, they met a trio of travelers: the witcher Geralt of Rivia, sorceress Triss Merigold, and a young girl named Ciri. Geralt recognized his old mate and they asked to join them for a time being. The sorceress was very sick and was unable to take care of herself and so the witcher helped look after her. Yarpen noted how Geralt took care of the sorceress in a very kind manner and told Ciri never to make the same mistake as Triss, and confuse care and compassion with 'something else'.
Despite helping King Henselt, the king didn't trust Yarpen and his dwarven company, believing all non-humans conspired with the Scoia'tael, and so the king had one of his soldiers tip off the Scoia'tael about the convoy so they'd attack the group to test the dwarf's loyalty. The company proved their loyalty near Shaerrawedd, as they attacked back, though two of Yarpen's men died in the fight. Afterwards, on hearing that his men died because of his employer, Yarpen became enraged. At this time, Geralt's party left Yarpen's company, heading to Ellander and the dwarves continued on their own along the Lixela.
Later, when the Second Northern War begun, Yarpen fought against the invading Nilfgaardian forces. He proved to be a very skilled warrior and fought one battle after another, eventually standing in the last battle of the war, the Battle of Brenna. He survived the war and was present during the parade in Novigrad. However, his men most likely died during this battle since they were not present during any of Yarpen's adventures afterwards.
In Saskia's service.
When Saskia the Dragonslayer began to rally folks under her banner with promise of independent realm where all will be considered equal, Yarpen joined and moved with her to the city of Vergen in Upper Aedirn. There he worked with other dwarven mates such as Skalen Burdon and Sheldon Skaggs. At first, all was relatively fine but then King Demavend III of Aedirn was assassinated. Even though he left an heir, his son Prince Stennis, King Henselt used the opportunity and invaded the Pontar Valley with the intention to annex it. Thus Stennis and his noblemen joined their forces with Saskia and moved to Vergen and Yarpen became a member of the War council.
Saskia and the prince were later invited to negotiations with the king. Yarpen did not accompanied them and instead stood on guard near the city.
"If Geralt took Iorveth's path:" There he met again the witcher Geralt, now accompanied by Iorveth and another dwarven friend of his, Zoltan Chivay. Yarpen was happy to see them but quickly noticed that Geralt acted like he had no idea who the dwarf was. Zoltan explained that Geralt suffered from amnesia and didn't remember a thing before he awaken near Kaer Morhen.
Their conversation was cut short as they saw a powerful surge of energy emanating from the place of negotiations. Geralt and Iorveth quickly hurried there and discovered that King Henselt had murdered a monk named Olcan and released a dormant curse. The duo had to help Saskia and the prince get through the cursed mist full of wraiths. With help from a magical owl, they eventually managed to arrive safely in Vergen. There, a War council was summoned to deal with the news of the curse and Iorveth's arrival and eventually an agreement was reached and Saskia stood for a ceremonial toast. However, she fell to the ground once she drank from the chalice - clearly poisoned. Sorceress Philippa Eilhart, Saskia's advisor and the magical owl, discovered that she was indeed poisoned by Thaumador and now her life hanged by a thread.
Philippa prepared a list of items and ingredients that would help her make a cure for the Dragonslayer. Meanwhile, Yarpen and his mates went to the local pub named The Cauldron and shared all news and happenings. They were soon joined by the witcher, who took it upon himself to find all the items Philippa needed. He also engaged in a friendly chat and even fought Yarpen in Arm wrestling but the situation was not easy so, after a while, they started to plan their next move. One of the items the sorceress needed was a special herb known as immortelle that grew deep below the surface. Local mines were an ideal place to look for it, but they were unfortunately closed because various filth infested them and made them incredibly dangerous. Yarpen, Sheldon, and Zoltan decided that they will accompany the witcher, provided he got access to the mines, so Geralt persuaded a local alderman Cecil Burdon to give them access. The group entered the mines and confirmed that the mines were indeed infested by necrophages. They killed every single one that they discovered, including their nests, as they moved deeper and deeper into the mine. After some time, they found the place where the herb was growing but the place was also the territory of a very dangerous and powerful monster, Bullvore. The group fought the beast and eventually killed it, allowing them to finally pick the herb. With it in hand, they returned to the surface and Geralt continued on while the dwarves retreated to the inn and continued their conversations.
Yarpen and his men were a vital part of the defending forces and thanks to soldiers like them, Vergen emerged victorious, Kaedweni forces were decimated, and King Henselt was captured. After the battle, Saskia and Philippa left for Loc Muinne where a great summit was to be held while Yarpen stayed in the city.
"If Geralt took Roche's path:" Geralt, accompanied by Vernon Roche, commander of Blue Stripes, joined the forces of King Henselt. Thus the witcher met Yarpen only during his quest to find the items needed to lift the curse. Yarpen, with Skalen Burdon, were guarding the Mahakam gate.
Hunt for a chelonodrake.
After the events at Loc Muinne, Saskia returned to Vergen and revealed that she was a dragon and, as expected, Vergen's residents had mixed feelings about it. Many abandoned the city and while others watched her actions closely.
Not fully recovered from Philippa's spell, Saskia (while in dragon form) unintentionally killed a group of dwarves during the first expedition against the Chelonodrake. Come morning she returned, in human form, to Vergen and swore before all the inhabitants that she'd never again transform into a dragon or else she'd leave the area.
Three weeks later, Saskia and Yarpen Zigrin talked to Geralt about the Chelonodrake and convinced him to help them slay the monster. Five days later she, Geralt, Eggar, Maevarienn, and Yarpen created a plan to kill the monster.
Two days later the group, accompanied by Barclay Els, went on the final expedition against the Chelonodrake. After defeating the monster, in which Barclay was heavily wounded, Saskia broke her promise and transformed into a dragon to get hiim to the dwarven medics fast. Unfortunately it was already too late and she decided to leave Vergen for breaking her oath.
The Third War.
Not long after the hunt, the Nilfgaardian Empire attacked again, starting the Third Northern War. They quickly conquered all the lands up to the river Pontar. Fortunately, Yarpen managed to survive and during the rest of the war was alive and well.
"First impressions can be quite deceiving, especially when they involve Yarpen Zigrin. The stocky dwarf is a veteran warrior and famed dragon-hunter, tough as a Mahakam-forged blade and many times as deadly. He's also a dwarf of few words, and can be painfully direct...to the point of being a real plougher at times. But it is a grave error to dismiss him as a mere blunt weapon, unfit for battles requiring diplomatic skill as much as a strong axe arm. What he lacks in terms of a silver tongue he makes up for in honesty and a broad sense of humor most often deployed over a bottle of mead—or five. Any adversaries he doesn't win over with a night of drink and dirty limericks, he can pummel into submission while they shake off the hangover the next morning. This combination of brawn and bonhomie has earned Yarpen the allegiance of a band of dwarven fighters, and has even been known to secure him the help of sorceresses and witchers in his hunts for legendary beasts and stockpiles of treasure."
"The two things that make Yarpen Zigrin a truly formidable asset in any war effort or adventure is the respect he commands among his kind and the gear he and his kin bring along on the road. The leader of a band of dwarves, Yarpen has the capacity to issue orders to his posse, greatly extending his tactical options."
"Yarpen's other strength is his proficiency in wielding and using any kind of battlefield hardware one can imagine: battle hammers, daggers, swords or axes—if it can be deployed on the battlefield, he can definitely use it to instill fear in the hearts of his and his friends' enemies."

Lady of the Lake's altar

Rising majestically from a stone outcropping on the Lakeside near Murky Waters, stands the altar to the Lady of the Lake. The local vodyans worship here as evidenced by the cleric who tends the altar.
It is from this monument that Geralt receives the clues necessary to collect the correct offerings for the Lady. Text on the altar reads as follows:
"... For the Lady of the Lake is a goddess of elder peoples of such wisdom and might that her single utterance conquered hatred and greed. She spoke but one sentence, one sentence so filled with truth that they had no choice — for no man and no vodyanoi can resist the ultimate truth. And so humans and vodyanoi shoook hands and presented each other with gifts, forging a truce. Wondrous were the gifts indeed! A gold bracelet belonging to the village's founder, richly ornamented by a true master's hand, went to the vodyanoi. And an old vodyanoi looked upon the Lady's face, and said: "Thy word can make this world sink just as it can make it burn until only ashes remain." And as the people saw a fine statue of alabaster appear, they were all speechless. And by the lake, in a wondrous land, a great feast was held. And so on the story goes..."

Silver sword

Silver sword is a specialized sword within the Witcher lore that is primarily used to combat supernatural enemies. As the name suggests, silver is the crux of the weapon's special properties, as many beings are especially vulnerable to it.
History.
Traditionally, a witcher uses two swords, with the silver sword only meant for certain kinds of monsters and other supernatural foes, like necrophages, therianthropes, cursed ones, shapeshifters, wraiths, and vampires. The steel sword would stand in when raw physical power is an obvious choice.
The "silver" swords which witchers make for themselves (or contract swordsmiths to make for them) are traditionally made from meteoric iron, which is then coated in silver and inscribed with magical runes. A purely silver sword would be entirely too soft and therefore useless. It is still very delicate however so witchers have to use them carefully - for example, crossing with another sword would easily damage it.
Gameplay.
Silver sword is one of two primary means of combat in all 3 games, accompanied by the steel sword in which both weapons occupy separate equipment slots; switching between the two can be done outside the inventory screen and even mid-action.
Silver and steel swords each can inflict damage to a certain type of enemies that the other couldn't. Unlike the books, silver swords are used to fight any post-conjunction creatures and supernatural beings, like trolls and giants, whereas humans and non-humans are faced with the steel sword, although exceptions like the Wild Hunt do exist.
Design-wise, silver swords in the game usually have pinching crossguards, forming the letter 'Y' with its grip. This was likely done as a visual aid to clearly show which weapon Geralt is holding at the time. Geralt himself is not limited to his starting witcher silver sword, as players can acquire many different ones throughout the three games.

The "friendly vodyan priest" was a vodyanoy cleric from the Underwater City who tended to an altar of the Lady of the Lake near Murky Waters.
Biography.
He was one of the first witcher Geralt of Rivia met upon his arrival in Murky Waters. He told the witcher of Berengar's presence in the area and also of the strife brewing between the vodyanoy and local humans.
Although the friendly priest was often driven away from his post at the foot of the altar by Dagon worshippers, Geralt dispatched them at that time so that the friendly priest could return.

Shani's apartment in Vizima can be difficult to get to because of Grandma who stands vigil downstairs. It seems that Grandma has lived a full life: her diary reveals that she has had at least five sexual encounters in her younger days! (Just the first few pages of that diary reveal five lovers, as noted if Carmen ends up in Shani's home.) Sadly now, in retirement, she prefers to play sentry within her own home. (That is not a reference to the unrelated Sentry of Chapter 2's mage tower.)
Getting past Grandma is no easy feat, but Geralt has a number of tricks up his sleeve. Some ploys result in gaining entry that one time only, other times, permanent entry is gained. One thing that is sure to end badly is showing up drunk.
The art of conversation:
Geralt can use sweet talk. Most of the conversation threads are very funny, worth investigating if for no other reason than to hear them all:
The art of gift-giving:
Geralt can use gifts to gain entry:
A well-placed oren:
Orens go a long way as well. The bribe opportunity presents itself when Grandma asks Geralt to "take pity on the kitty", I have found that 20 seems to do the trick, despite the fact that the slider begins at 10 .
Credentials:
The Prophet Lebioda's signet ring is instantly recognized by Grandma and allows Geralt to enter the premises. When she sees it she cries "Holy Melitele! Tis a monastic sign... a monk of the Prophet Lebioda disguised as a witcher" and she insists that "father" Geralt help sway Shani away from her evil profession of medicine and back into the fold of the church.
At Night
 At night, when Shani is home, there is a chance that Grandma will greet Geralt with warmth and welcome him in.

Druids' circle

A druids' circle is usually a clearing in a grove where druids live or gather. The term is also used to refer to the group of druids themselves.
"The Witcher".
The Druids' circle is located in the Fields outside Murky Waters, east-northeast of the Hermit's hut. It is where Geralt must defeat nine of the wraiths who haunt it for the Hermit. These wraiths are part of the King of the Wild Hunt's entourage.
Notes.
At night, the candle at the base of the alter is lit. Geralt can blow it out with Aard and relight it with Igni. (This likely does not work during the Hunting the Wild Hunt quest.)

Sodden was a former kingdom located around the Yaruga river between Cintra, Brugge, and Riverdell. After the decisive Battle of Sodden Hill that marked Nilfgaard's defeat during the First Northern War, Sodden was split into Upper Sodden and Lower Sodden, with the Yaruga forming a natural border. With the Peace of Cintra, the two halves were recombined into Sodden and it became a vassal state of Temeria.
History.
Under Temerian rule.
After the death of Ekkehard of Sodden, the throne passed to his closest living relative, his half-nephew Foltest.
Northern Wars.
In 1263, the Nilfgaardian Empire launched a full scale invasion of the north, and after slaughtering the kingdom of Cintra, moved its army to Sodden. The first battle of Sodden resulted in the northern army being swiftly defeated, and the Nilfgaardians conquering the region later known as Upper Sodden, before crossing the Yaruga and attacking the northernmost regions of Sodden, where they were defeated in the Battle of Sodden Hill. The defeat caused the Nilfgaardian Army to retreat back across the Yaruga, and no further battle insured as the other bank was too well defended by the northern armies.
After the split, Lower Sodden stayed under Foltest's rule, despite numerous small Imperial raids, and Upper Sodden became a province of Cintra under Nilfgaardian rule, the two managing a "de jure" peace agreement due to Emhyr's stipulations with Temeria. Though the Soddeners weren't happy under occupation and an anti-Nilfgaard group was born in the Slopes. After the Peace of Cintra in 1268, the two regions were reunited as Sodden under Temeria.
National emblems.
The coat of arms for Sodden is not actually described in the novels. This particular coat of arms was designed by our resident heraldry and Witcher expert and was considered unofficial until they were used in "" as part of Ciri's family tree image.

Yaruga (Polish: "Jaruga"), or Yarra to the Nilfgaardians, is the largest river in the Northern Kingdoms, beginning in the Fiery or Blue Mountains and flowing westward all the way to the Great Sea. The kingdoms of Cintra and Verden are located at the mouth of the river.
History.
During the First Landing, the first humans landed their ships in the mouth of the Yaruga, before colonising slowly eastward.
Northern Wars.
In 1263, midway through the First Northern War, the Nilfgaardian Army crossed the Yaruga after conquering Cintra and Upper Sodden, and was defeated in the Battle of Sodden Hill. They retreated back over the river and both the Nilfgaardians and the Northern armies reached a stalement with each side on either bank of the river. Some years later, in July 1267, Nilfgaardian troops crossed the river again starting the Second Northern War.
By August, the Nilfgaardians set up a blockade across the mouth of the Yaruga against the Redanians, blocking their ships and goods from access to Skellige.

Sancia of Sodden was Gutram's daughter from a second marriage, a princess of Sodden, and the half-sister to Ekkehard of Sodden. She married Medell of Temeria, and thus became the mother of Foltest and Adda and the grandmother of Adda the White.
She never accepted the incestuous relationship between her children; it would've been reason enough to curse their child to become a striga.

Fregenal was once an elder druid from the Mayena Circle of Druids before he was expelled eleven years prior to the events of the short story "Droga, z której się nie wraca".
The circumstances under which he was expelled remain unknown, but before leaving, Fregenal stole several pages from forbidden books. With these pages, he studied the dangerous magic of the wizard Alzur.
He reportedly used this magic to create the first koshchey by using Alzur's Double Cross (though it also could have been caused by some other ), and formed the band of mercenaries known as Koshchey's Men. Fregenal and Koshchey's Men began terrorising villages in the Amell Mountains, robbing them, raping their women, and in some cases murdering the villagers and razing the villages to the ground.
In one such village, the mountainside Klucz, a blacksmith named Mikula began rallying the villages to oppose Fregenal and his mercenaries, but he required more aid. After being rebuffed by the militia of Mayena, Mikula appealed to the circle of druids there for support. Fregenal learnt of the blacksmith's schemes and dispatched a witch in his employ, Manissa, to assassinate the druid at the crossroads to Klucz. His ploy failed when fate intervened and the warrior Korin arrived at the crossroads instead. The druidess Visenna arrived shortly thereafter, and she and Korin joined forces with Mikula's assembled force at Klucz. Meanwhile, after learning that Fregenal was bent on world domination, a werebbubb by the name of Kehl led a revolt against the renegade sorcerer over their conflicting goals, capturing the druid and leaving him for the oncoming army.
Fregenal was helpless when Visenna, Korin and Mikula arrived and was forced to lead them to the koshchey. There, he managed to escape but ultimately met his end at the hands of Mikula. Kehl returned to finish what he started and aided Visenna, Korin and Mikula in destroying Fregenal's koshchey once and for all. Besides featuring in the short story Droga, z której się nie wraca, Fregenal also appears in the graphic novel based on the same story.

"A small fragment of a broken mirror."
According to the healer (or Dandelion, depending on Abigail's fate in Chapter I), Alina had a Mirror of Nehaleni before she died. It is not exactly clear if breaking the mirror brought on Alina's curse, or if the mirror broke as a result of the curse, but the mirror now lies in pieces strewn about the fields outside Murky Waters. In order to free Alina from her curse, Geralt must find the shards and reassemble the mirror as part of the Heat of the Day quest.
There are five shards to find in the fields. They are not difficult to find as each is guarded by a Midday bride and the glow can be seen from quite a distance. They can only be found during the day. The pieces are in the following locations:

Barefield was first settled by the Dauk and Wozgor people sometime before the First Landing in the 760s, according to a classification by the historian Arnelius Grock.
Dragon hunt.
In the early 1250s, the area attracted attention when a green dragon named Myrgtabrakke suddenly appeared and began taking livestock from the local peasant farms. The locals, with the help of a shoemaker named Sheepbagger managed to almost kill the beast by baiting the animal with the carcass of a sheep stuffed with a cocktail sure to kill anything. They were not quite successful, however, and the dragon managed to fly off into the canyons and relative safety.

Oxenfurt is a Redanian city located on the northern shore of the Pontar river and southeast of Novigrad. It is famous for its Academy, which is the largest in the Northern Kingdoms. It is about three hundred miles west of Tretogor.
It is a bustling and bawdy haven for students, artists, scholars, and freethinkers. Here the young reign supreme (in spirit, if not always in fact), with a mug of something strong in hand as they blaze new trails in fashion and thought, confident that the rest of the world will soon follow.
History.
First Landing.
The area where Oxenfurt stands was originally inhabited by the elves. When the humans arrived during the First Landing around five hundred years ago, elves abandoned the area. Humans built a city in place of the original settlement, with some elven buildings surviving to modern era.
Andrzej Sapkowski.
The wooden, colorful town of Oxenfurt with its narrow streets and pointed roofs. The town of Oxenfurt which lived off the Academy, off its students, lecturers, scholars, researchers and their guests, who lived off science and knowledge, off what accompanies the process of learning. In the town of Oxenfurt, from the by-products and chippings of theory, practice, business and profit were born.
The poet rode slowly along a muddy, crowded street, passing workshops, studios, stalls, shops small and large where, thanks to the Academy, tens of thousands of articles and wonderful things were produced and sold which were unattainable in other corners of the world where their production was considered impossible, or pointless. He passed inns, taverns, stands, huts, counters and portable grills from which floated the appetising aromas of elaborate dishes unknown elsewhere in the world, seasoned in ways not known anywhere else. This was Oxenfurt, the colorful, joyful, noisy and sweet-smelling town of miracles into which shrewd people, full of initiative, had turned dry and useless theories drawn little by little from the university. pgs. 190 - 191, "Blood of Elves" (UK edition)
In the third installment of the trilogy, Oxenfurt appears as the second largest city in the game. The city is situated east of the region Velen. It's also featured as a main showplace in "Hearts of Stone" expansion, the first expansion for "The Witcher 3". There is also an interesting book describing the city, Pearls of the North - Oxenfurt.
However, there are some inconsistencies with the appearance of the city described in the book. The University has quite a different appearance, lacking the mentioned aqueduct and sewage treatment plants. Even the currency of the city does not appear nor is it ever mentioned.

Aedd Gynvael (Elder Speech: a Shard of Ice) is a city in Narok, in the Dogbane on the Toina river, governed from Rakverelin. The local alderman is Herbolth and the resident mage is Istredd.
History.
The city's name, as recounted by Yennefer, comes from an ancient elven story. The myth tells of the Winter Queen who used to cross the land in a sleigh drawn by white horses during blizzards. As she went, small shards of ice flew about. Those who were hit by one of these shards were forever doomed. Nothing in this world made them happy any more, everything looked sad, disgusting and dull except the whiteness of the snow, the frost and the ice. They left everything behind them to search for the Winter Queen, forever wandering without being able to find her. And thus they died attempting to fulfill their dream. According to Geralt, the "Winter Queen" was actually the dreaded Wild Hunt, which haunted certain forsaken lands, enslaving its inhabitants' will and making them its thralls. The witcher also mentioned that he was offered money to lift the curse and banish the Wild Hunt, but ended up refusing the offer, for reasons unknown.
Geralt slew a zeugl during his and Yennefer's stay in the city.

Biography.
He was friendly with Geralt and when the witcher dropped by, Caldemeyn warmly greeted him and let him stay at his home. However, when Geralt got caught in the middle of Stregobor and Renfri's fight with one another, the witcher had to kill all of Renfri's band and Renfri herself to protect the town's people. As the locals didn't know what Renfri had been planning, they merely saw Geralt savagely cut down a group of people and began to throw stones at the witcher. Caldemeyn called them off, but then, knowing the townsfolk would never forget about the incident, told Geralt to leave and never come back.
Along with his daughter, he attended the wedding of Geralt and Yennefer.

 &lt;data source="id"&gt;&lt;label&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;The Paths of Destiny is a quest which begins in Chapter IV when Geralt finds the witcher who has preceded him to Murky Waters, Berengar. It is quite closely tied to the Alvin quest.
Walkthrough.
When Geralt first arrives at the Lakeside, one of the first people he meets is the friendly vodyan priest who tends the altar to the Lady of the Lake. Speaking with the cleric, the witcher learns that another witcher has preceded him to the sleepy village. This other witcher had agreed to resolve the conflict between the villagers and the vodyanoi, but so far had produced no results. The friendly priest also mentions that the other witcher is most likely in the nearby crypt.
Geralt decides to find this witcher and speak with him. He finds the crypt and enters. No sooner is he inside, than he see a figure up ahead in the shadows. Finally, after all the searching and speculation, our hero meets Berengar, the errant witcher, face-to-face. They do not get much of a chance to speak as they are immediately set upon by alps and a bruxa. The two witchers battle their way through the crypt, clearing it of monsters as they go.
Once done, Berengar grudgingly agrees to speak with Geralt, but not there in the crypt. He insists they leave and go to his campfire to speak. They do, and at long last our hero gets to hear Berengar's story from the man himself. They speak a few more times over the course of the act, each conversation revealing a little bit more information.
The Lady of the Lake even involves herself, suggesting that Geralt speak with Berengar about destiny as she has had troubling visions about a witcher's destiny and wants to spare him some pain and grief. The problem is that she does not know if the visions pertain to Berengar or Geralt.
The witcher then goes back to speak with Berengar, this time about more philosophical issues. It is at this point that we find out that Berengar holds the concept of destiny in utter contempt, placing it in the same category as witchers and Salamandra as far as he is concerned. Our hero reports his findings to the Lady who says that they merely confirm that her visions then must pertain to Geralt and not Berengar. She then promises our hero a gift to come at some point in the future, telling him to be patient. This gift comes in the form of a splendid silver sword, Aerondight, which the Lady gives to Geralt as she knights him for his good deeds. She also grants the witcher a silver talent.
Geralt meets Berengar one final time during his stay at the Lakeside. The two witchers meet on Black Tern Island where they confront each other. As with many quests in the game, our hero must once again make a difficult choice. Should he forgive Berengar for collaborating with Salamandra and allow the errant witcher to move on, perhaps making amends for his misdeeds, or should he put an end to things and kill him for his betrayal? Keep in mind that Berengar is the one who chooses to duel with Geralt or not, meaning that if Berengar feels Geralt is too condemning, Berengar is the one who challenges Geralt to a duel, leaving no choice for Geralt other than a fight to the death.
If Geralt spares him, Berengar returns one last time in Chapter V to help our hero fight Azar Javed. Sadly he is really of no use at all there, but I guess it is the thought that counts. If Geralt kills him, then it is Berengar's medallion which helps the witcher in his battle with the mad mage at the Old Manor.
Phases.
The Crypt.
We killed several alps and a bruxa. Berengar moved on. "If I want more information, I must follow him." (500 XP)
Monsters.
Berengar's not being too friendly. We have more monsters to face. "I must follow Berengar if I want any more information."
Further Combat.
We killed several alps. Berengar's not bad in a fight. He still doesn't want to tell me anything. I'll follow him. I'll gain his trust eventually. "I must follow Berengar if I want any more information." (1000 XP)
The Final Encounter.
Berengar refuses to talk about his past. I won't let him off so easily. There are a few monsters left to dispatch. "I must follow Berengar if I want any more information."
Monsters Defeated.
We dealt with another group of monsters. Maybe Berengar will finally stop avoiding my questions... "I'll try to talk to Berengar." (2000 XP)
Outside.
Berengar understands that I won't give up. We agreed to talk by the fire outside. "I should meet Berengar by the fire outside."
Berengar's Confession.
Berengar admitted that Salamandra forced him to work for them, but that he fled as soon as it was possible. The witcher is [in] no mood to confess, but he'll crack and tell me more in the end, I'm sure. I need to be patient, tend to some other matters. "I should tend to other matters while I wait for Berengar to become more talkative."
Berengar.
The Lady of the Lake asked me to talk to Berengar. He's probably sitting by the fire near the crypt. "The Lady of the Lake asked me to talk to Berengar."
Destiny.
Berengar seems to have no interest in destiny. I should see the Lady of the Lake and tell her. "I should see the Lady of the Lake and let her know Berengar's decision."
A Gift.
The Lady of the Lake promised me a gift. I'm to receive it in due course. "The Lady of the Lake promised me a gift. I need to be patient." (1000 XP)
The Sword.
The Lady of the Lake presented me with what looks like an exceptional sword. It is light, sharp as a razor, and it fits the hand neatly. It is also a gift from a goddess. I have a feeling it will be very useful. "The sword I received has a destiny of its own. Time will tell what that destiny is."
If Berengar is killed:
The Duel.
This was unavoidable. Berengar has challenged me to a duel. One of us will die - it can't end any other way. "Only one of us will leave here alive... I must win this duel." ( + 4500 XP)
The Medallion.
It had to end this way. I crossed blades with Berengar and killed him in a fair fight. I took his medallion - wouldn't want it to rust away on this island. I guess I should get back to the Lakeside. "I took Berengar's medallion... I should get back to the Lakeside."
If Berengar is allowed to go:
The Lakeside.
Berengar has departed. I hope he finds what he seeks. I'd best get back to the Lakeside. "I should get back to the Lakeside." ( + + 6500 XP)

Prize-winning cow

Strawberry is the village of Murky Waters' prize-winning cow. She has the glossiest coat in the area, glossier than her rival in Bullsville, thanks to Abigail, the local healer, who has concocted an ointment to enhance the shine. She is also extremely fond of dried fruit and nuts. Unfortunately for Strawberry, the vodyanoi would like to sacrifice her at the Altar of Dagon.
If Geralt chooses to side with the vodyanoi and offer Strawberry as a sacrifice to Dagon, then he must lure her all the way from her pen in the village to the landing where the Fisher King's boat is tied. He must then take her to Black Tern Island, and once there, to the altar, carefully avoiding any wyverns which might get in the way. Then he must kill her. Yes, kill poor, sweet, glossy-coated Strawberry.

Sweet Revenge is a quest given to Geralt by either Dandelion in Chapter IV right before the departure to Old Vizima, or King Foltest in Chapter V. It is the culmination of Geralt's quest to eradicate Salamandra and takes the witcher to the Old Manor.
Walkthrough.
This quest actually begins much earlier in Chapter V, but the action only really starts after we find our hero emerging from the Striga's crypt, having earlier been locked in by Velerad. The two men have a little exchange in which the witcher "thanks" the burgomeister for that little surprise, but then they get down to business. Geralt may or may not have killed the striga (his choice) but that has little impact on what follows.
" Geralt saved Adda:" Velerad rewards the witcher with D'yaebl, a nice steel sword, but possibly not as nice as the one Geralt is already carrying at that point.
"Geralt killed the striga:" no sword, and no more interaction with the Princess or striga, since she is dead.
Velerad then tells Geralt that the King has a message for him: "To cure the 'disease', go to the old manor". That is pretty clear. So, it is off to the old manor to finally confront Azar Javed and put an end to Salamandra once and for all.
Upon entering the area, Geralt meets de Wett and a handful of knights of the Order. The two speak and de Wett slips up when the witcher mentions having found a diary in the crypt. The count stupidly refers to the diary as Ostrit's diary. Not being one to let details like these slip by unnoticed, Geralt calls de Wett out on this little slip of the tongue. The Count, rather than back-pedalling, admits that he knew all about Adda's curse. He also suggests that he is actually just using Salamandra to achieve his own goals. He goes so far as to invite the witcher to join him, promising rich rewards. But our hero is steadfast and will have none of it. Naturally this can only be settled with a duel.
One duel, one dead Nilfgaardian count and a handful of Order corpses later, Geralt is on his way to the old manor proper. A few more obstacles throw themselves in his path, however. There is, of course, the usual complement of drowners, drowned dead, bloedzuigers, and Dagon worshippers, but after deftly navigating those, our hero continues climbing the hill towards the manor. When he reaches the ruined village, he comes upon Azar Javed, with Rayla! But it is no longer truly White Rayla, she has obviously been subjected to the dreaded Salamandra experiments and is now just an "enslaved bag of blood and muscles", albeit pretty well armed and capable (she can now blind opponents).
Azar does his usual taunting and disappearing act, leaving his newest "perfect creation" to deal with the witcher. Good thing the mage reanimated Rayla, since he can no longer rely on the Professor to fight his battles for him! Needless to say, the witcher does what he does best and puts Rayla to rest, finally and permanently. Then he presses onward toward his goal.
Beyond the ruined village is where the action really begins to heat up. Within the courtyard of the manor, Geralt can see his allies busily fighting a large number of Salamandra and these guys are of the mutated variety. There are armored hounds, mutants, mutant assassins, and greater mutants.
It is Yaevinn and a band of elves and dwarves who are fighting in the courtyard.
It is Siegfried and some knights of the Order.
He meets Triss aided by City Guardsmen.
Not one to let his friends fight alone, the witcher joins in the action. But once that threat has been eliminated, our hero must continue and somehow enter the catacombs beneath the old manor. Again, his ally proves useful.
Yaevinn tells him about a well shaft that he can squeeze through to enter the catacombs.
Siegfried tells him about a cave, once inside he only needs to go straight until he finds a small passage.
Triss has procured a key to the door.
Each entrance leaves the witcher at a different starting point in the catacombs (see the map below), but the destination remains the same: Javed's laboratory.
Geralt then fights his way through the catacombs, meeting Javed twice more and twice more the sorcerer tries to leave the witcher to his minions while fleeing. The first encounter has Javed leaving our hero to face a koshchey he has conjured, assuming, wrongly once again - when will this guy learn? - that the beast will make quick work of Geralt. No such luck. The second encounter features two "greater brothers", but they are no more successful at stopping the witcher than the koshchey was. There is no time to savour the victory, however as our hero is immediately teleported, courtesy of Azar to a new destination: Javed's lab.
It is time for the final confrontation! There is the usual grandiose evil overlord speech, complete with the standard evil overlord miscalculations and then it is down to business.
"If Geralt spared Berengar in Chapter IV:" Berengar faithfully shows up with every intention of helping Geralt, but sadly his skills appear to be rustier than he bargained for.
"If Geralt killed Berengar:" Javed suddenly notices that Geralt happens to be wearing not only his own medallion, but Berengar's as well. The mage comments that "even with the medallion" the witcher has no chance.
Ha! Good-bye Azar! But wait. It is not over yet. Geralt barely has time to check Javed's body for loot, I mean the stolen Witchers' secrets, when he hears a vaguely familiar voice calling the now deceased mage. It is the Grand Master via telecommunicator! How very interesting. This can mean only one thing. It seems Javed was not the mastermind after all, it was Jacques de Aldersberg all along. That explains why Javed did not have the secrets on his person, nor anywhere in the lab. The Grand Master has them. The witcher vows then and there to find the Grand Master and really finish things.
Phases.
A Lead.
It seems I must go to Old Vizima to hunt down the Salamandra boss. All the clues lead there. "I must go to Old Vizima to hunt down the Salamandra boss."
Salamandra.
Foltest wants me to deal with the Salamandra - once and for all. I hope the king proves a trustworthy ally. "I must dismantle Salamandra at the behest of the king himself."
The Experiment.
Kalkstein claims the strange monster I slew was born of Salamandra's experiments. The stolen witchers' secrets are being used in a terrifying way... The soldiers contend the beast came from the swamp cemetery. The Salamandar hideout must be located there. "The Salamandra hideout must be near the cemetery in the swamp."
Zoltan / Siegfried / Shani.
Zoltan said he and the remaining refugees would hide in the druids' cave in the swamp. I need to press forward. "I need to go on." (3000 XP)
Siegfried has joined the Grand Master and returned to Vizima. I must press on. "I must go on." (3000 XP)
Shani said she would hide in the druids' cave in the swamp and help the refugees. I must press on. " I have to go on." (3000 XP)
A Hint.
The king used Velerad to pass on a hint about Salamandra. I need to go to the Old Manor. Apparently, I'll find what I'm looking for there. "I must go to the Old Manor, where I shall find what I'm looking for."
The Death of De Wett.
De Wett was punished for his treachery. Nothing in the way now. I can go to the Old Manor. Let's see this secret Salamandra base... "The way is clear, I can now go to the Old Manor, the secret Salamandra base."
Mutated Rayla.
I came upon Rayla. She underwent a mutation that has clearly affected her mind. Unfortunately, I have to kill her. She has left me no choice. " I have to kill Rayla, she has left me no choice."
Almost there.
I came across Salamanders and some mutated hounds in the Old Manor. I must be nearing my goal. "I must be getting close."
Entering the Catacombs.
Yaevinn will lead me to the entrance of the catacombs. I must follow him. "I should follow Yaevinn." (3000 XP)
Siegfried knows of an entrance to the catacombs beneath the Old Manor and will lead me there. I need to follow him. "I must follow Siegfried." (3000 XP)
Triss knows of an entrance to the catacombs beneath the Old Manor and decided to lead me there. I need to follow her. "I must follow Triss." (3000 XP)
A Sacrifice.
Yaevinn decided to make a stand by the entrance, to face the enemy there. He nearly forced me to descend. I must hurry so his sacrifice is not in vain. "I must descend and deal with Salamandra - once and for all."
Siegfried is making a stand by the entrance, facing they enemy there. He nearly forced me to descend. I must hurry so his sacrifice is not in vain. "I must descend and deal with Salamandra - once and for all."
Triss decided to make a stand by the entrance, face the enemy there. She nearly forced me to descend. I need to hurry so her sacrifice is not in vain. "I must descend and deal with Salamandra - once and for all."
The Koshchey.
I killed the koshchey, one of the most fearsome monsters I ever dealt with. I must press on and find Salamandra's leader. "I must go on and find Salamandra's leader."
Azar Javed's Demise.
I killed Azar Javed, the leader of Salamandra. The hydra has lost its head, the criminal organization has ceased to exist. I should search this chamber thoroughly, recover the stolen witchers' secrets. " I must search this laboratory thoroughly." (3000 XP)
A Boat.
I couldn't find the witchers' secrets, but that hardly brings my search to an end. I must warn the king of the Grand Master's intentions. He may have stolen the secrets.
Yaevinn has arranged transport to the Temple Quarter. We're to meet at the landing, where a boat awaits us. "I must warn the king. Yaevinn awaits at the landing with a boat that will take us to Vizima."
Siegfried has arranged transport to the Temple Quarter. We're to meet at the landing, where a boat awaits us. "I must warn the king. Siegfried awaits at the landing with a boat that will take us to Vizima."
Triss has arranged transport to the Temple Quarter. We're to meet at the landing, where a boat awaits us. "I must warn the king. Triss awaits at the landing with a boat that will take us to Vizima."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Hope Burns Bright is a quest in Chapter V which Geralt undertakes if he chooses the Scoia'tael path.
Walkthrough.
Like The Flame that Cleanses and Under a Fiery Sky, this quest sees Geralt fight his way to the field hospital aided by his ally (in this case, Zoltan), deal with the street fighting, and make it to the swamp cemetery. It is the framing quest for Chapter V as Geralt officially declares that he has chosen a path, the Scoia'tael path.
This quest begins when Geralt meets Zoltan Chivay on the dike, having first spoken with the presiding official upon reaching the Dike. Zoltan greets him warmly, but explains that there is still much work ahead. The dwarf also lets the witcher know that Shani has set up a field hospital in Old Vizima. The two then set off to find Shani, but they must first fight their way through the soldiers of the Order who blocking the only path to the former capital.
As our hero reaches the gate, we are treated to a cut scene of King Foltest himself, recently returned from abroad. As the regent and his retinue make their way through the chaos inside the gate, they are suddenly ambushed by more Scoia'tael intent on assassinating the king. Victory, and indeed the monarch's survival, seem far from assured when who but the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose should appear to save the day.
De Aldersberg warns the king that his aid might not be so timely in the future and demands total control over the Viziman forces. Foltest rejects this proposal outright and the two part coolly. The king and his entourage are about to return to the castle to discuss further strategies when the main gates open revealing Geralt.
At first, Foltest seems hardly pleased to see the witcher and grumbles about it to Velerad, but ultimately demands that Geralt accompany the entourage back to the castle for a chat.
Back at the castle, the king sets two tasks for the witcher: delivery the princess from the striga curse and eradicate Salamandra. He also sneaks in a little chit chat about women and a quick round of dice poker. He tells Geralt that Triss Merigold, Velerad and Count de Wett are at his disposal as trusted advisors of the court and dismisses him. Monarchs can be so rude!
Geralt takes the opportunity to converse with the royal advisors. After consulting each of them, he decides to explore the castle a bit more. A group of courtiers is dancing and watching them is a noblewoman who seems to be alone. The witcher introduces himself and learns that his newest acquaintance is Antoinnette, from the duchy of Toussaint.
She suspects they have met before, but amnesiac as our hero remains, he has no memory of the event and just shrugs off the idea. Undeterred, Antoinnette cuts to the chase and asks the witcher if he would be willing to render a small service, in return for a reward, of course. Geralt agrees and bids her farewell. Just then, he is summoned once again to speak with Foltest, but this time in the regent's private chambers.
The two revisit the tasks at hand and the king gives Geralt leave to kill Adda, if necessary, but admonishes him that this should be done only as a last resort and must absolutely spare the princess any pain or suffering. Otherwise, Foltest tells the witcher that his friends will suffer a similar fate. He then takes a moment to sneak in a little chit chat about women and a quick round of dice poker and then sends our hero on his way, telling him to speak with the chamberlain about travel arrangements back to Old Vizima.
Once back in the old part of town, Geralt is met by Zoltan. He explains there are two bands of refugees who need to escorted to the field hospital set up by Shani, but the path is blocked by all the fighting in the streets. He tells the refugees can not make it alone so the two set off to first find the hiding citizens and then take them to the hospital where at least here is still some measure of relative safety. Some very amusing conversations ensue while trying to rendezvous with the refugee groups, most notably about the calls and mating habits of "polar tigers".
Geralt and Zoltan nevertheless find them and escort them safely to the field hospital. Mission accomplished.
Phases.
Zoltan.
Zoltan asked me to help him get to Old Vizima. We'll escort the refugees to a safe hospital. "I promised Zoltan I would help escort the refugees to a safe hospital."
Refugees.
Zoltan asked me to help him. We must round up the refugees and lead them out of the city. "We must gather the refugees and lead them out of the city."
Another Group.
We gathered a group of refugees, just as Zoltan asked. I must protect them as we look for another group. "We need to collect another group of refugees."
Hospital Bound.
Zoltan and I have gathered both groups of refugees. We must escort them to the hospital. "The refugees need to be escorted to the hospital."
The Striga.
I met Shani at the hospital, but we were interrupted by a messenger who told us that a striga was seen in town. I have to tend to the monster. "First and foremost, I must deal with the striga."
To Shani.
I dealt with the "striga"... I can now return to the hospital and speak with Shani. "I can return to the hospital and speak with Shani."
Defense.
Knights of the Order have broken into the hospital. I must defend the wounded. "I must defend the wounded from the knights of the Order."
Knights of the Order.
I eliminated a group of attacking knights of the Order. Others have probably surrounded the hospital. I must face them. "I must face the knights of the Order outside the hospital." (3000 XP)
Toruviel's Commando.
The knights have engaged Toruviel's commando by the hospital. I must help her! "I must help Toruviel."
An Invitation.
I helped Toruviel against the knights of the Order. I should follow her now. "I should follow Toruviel."
Talking to Toruviel.
Follow the commando outside and skip the sex. (2000 XP)
We'll soon attack the barricade. First, I need to speak with Toruviel in private. "I need to speak with Toruviel in private." (4000 XP)
The Barricade.
We're attacking the barricade, the Order's last line of defense in Old Vizima. "We're attacking the barricade, the Order's last line of defense."
Assaulting the Barricade.
I'll join the battle for the barricade. "I'll join the battle for the barricade."
Flanking on the Right.
We're making our way to the right flank. We must break through the first barricade. "We're breaking through to the right flank!"
Flanking on the Left.
Time to attack on the left. We need to break through to Toruviel! "We're attacking the other flank in an effort to get to Toruviel."
Yaevinn's Plan.
Toruviel claims Yaevinn is planning something. We must create a diversion, draw attention away from him... A frontal attack would be best. I'm beginning to sound like Zoltan... "We're mounting a frontal attack to draw attention away from Yaevinn."
The Fight is Won.
White Rayla is dead. The knights of the Order are fleeing. It looks like we won that fight. "It seems we have won this fight."
The Refugees Lost / The Refugees Saved.
Lost the refugees:
The refugees are all dead. Zoltan will blame me for the rest of his days... "The refugees are all dead." (4000 XP)
Saved the refugees:
I managed to extract the refugees out of Vizima. They should be safe in the cave in the swamp. I must lead them there. " I must lead the refugees to the cave in the swamp." (9000 XP)

Under a Fiery Sky is a primary quest in Chapter V which Geralt undertakes if he chooses the witcher/neutral path.
Walkthrough.
Like Hope Burns Bright and The Flame that Cleanses, this quest sees Geralt fight his way to the field hospital aided by his ally (in this case, Shani), deal with the street fighting, and make it to the swamp cemetery. It is the framing quest for Chapter V as Geralt officially declares that he has chosen a path, the Witcher / neutral path.
The quest begins when Geralt meets Zoltan Chivay on the dike after speaking with the presiding official. The dwarf explains the current situation in Old Vizima and alerts the witcher to the fact that Shani has set up a field hospital there. The Witcher then sets off to find Shani, but first he must fight his way through the warring Scoia'tael and Order factions blocking the only path to the gate.
As our hero reaches the gate, we are treated to a cut scene of King Foltest himself, recently returned from abroad. As the regent and his retinue make their way through the chaos inside the gate, they are suddenly ambushed by more Scoia'tael intent on assassinating the king. Victory, and indeed the monarch's survival, seem far from assured when who but the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose should appear to save the day.

He then takes a moment to sneak in a little chit chat about women and a quick round of dice poker and then sends our hero on his way, telling him to speak with the chamberlain about travel arrangements back to Old Vizima.
Once back in the old city, he is met by two nurses who are trapped and can not get to the field hospital where they intend to help Shani tending the sick and injured. Naturally the witcher offers to escort them safely to their destination. They gratefully accept his escort and make their way cautiously behind him to the hospital. Once there, they offer to show their gratitude a bit more tangibly if he drops by when Shani is not around. Mission accomplished and one date lined up!
Phases.
Shani.
The Rebellion has engulfed Old Vizima. Zoltan asked to get Shani out of there. I'll find her at the hospital. "I must get Shani out of the hospital in Old Vizima."
Nurses.
I promised the nurses I would escort them to the hospital where Shani is now. "I promised the nurses I would escort them to the hospital where Shani."
Problems.
A few problems on our way to the hospital, but I took care of them. "We can continue on to the hospital."
The Hospital.
I took the nurses to the temporary hospital set up in the heart of Old Vizima. "The nurses have reached the hospital."
The Striga.
I met Shani at the hospital, but we were interrupted by a messenger who told us that a striga was seen in town. I have to tend to the monster. "First and foremost, I must deal with the striga."
A Talk with Shani.
I slew the beast... Now back to the hospital. Shani and I need to have a conversation, in relative calm. "I can now return to the hospital and speak with Shani."
Scoia'tael.
The Scoia'tael have broken into the hospital. I must defend the wounded. "I must defend the wounded against the Scoia'tael." (3000 XP)
Enemy Knights.
I defeated the Scoia'tael unit, but some idiots from the Order took us to be enemies. They'll pay for their stupidity. "The Knights of the Order must pay for their stupidity." (3000 XP)
The Hospital Under Siege.
I defeated the Knights of the Order. Things are getting dangerous here. I should take Shani somewhere safe, for a while at least. "I need to get Shani out of the hospital."
To The Druids.
Shani asked me to lead her to the druids in the swamp. She hopes they'll give her more medicine. Sounds reasonable. Anyhow, she will be safer there. "I need to get Shani to the druids in the swamp."
A Dark Alley.
Shani and I aren't going anywhere if I don't clear the alley of necrophages. "I must clear the alley of necrophages."
A Dark Alley.
A breeze... Poor Shani, she's not exactly used to sights like this. A few more necrophages to cull at the end of the alley. "A few more necrophages at the end of the alley."
The City Walls.
We've reached Vizima's walls. There's a breach in them further on... We need to follow the wall to the gap. "We must proceed along Vizima's walls."
The Breach.
It's getting hotter.. Luckily I can see the breach. A last push... "We must get to the breach. One final push."
Shani is Safe.
We've reached the swamp. Shani must go to the druids' cave for more medicine. I'll need to protect her from the swamp's less friendly inhabitants. "I must help Shani get to the druids's cave." (8000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;
The Flame that Cleanses is a quest in Chapter V which Geralt can undertake if he chooses the Order path.
Walkthrough.
Like Hope Burns Bright and Under a Fiery Sky, this quest sees Geralt fight his way to the field hospital aided by his ally (in this case, Rayla), deal with the street fighting, and make it to the swamp cemetery. It is the framing quest for Chapter V as Geralt officially declares that he has chosen a path, the Order path.
This quest begins when Geralt meets Zoltan Chivay on the dike, having first spoken with the presiding official, and the dwarf basically spits on him and leaves our hero to his fate, but not before letting him know that Shani has set up a field hospital in Old Vizima. The Witcher then sets off to find Shani, but first he must fight his way through the Scoia'tael blocking the only path to the gate.
As our hero reaches the gate, we are treated to a cut scene of King Foltest himself, recently returned from abroad. As the regent and his retinue make their way through the chaos inside the gate, they are suddenly ambushed by more Scoia'tael intent on assassinating the king. Victory, and indeed the monarch's survival, seem far from assured when who but the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose should appear to save the day.
De Aldersberg warns the king that his aid might not be so timely in the future and demands total control over the Viziman forces. Foltest rejects this proposal outright and the two part coolly. The king and his entourage are about to return to the castle to discuss further strategies when the main gates open revealing Geralt.
At first, Foltest seems hardly pleased to see the witcher and grumbles about it to Velerad, but ultimately demands that Geralt accompany the entourage back to the castle for a chat.
Back at the castle, the king sets two tasks for the witcher: deliver the princess from the striga's curse and dismantle the evil Salamandra organization. He tells Geralt that Triss Merigold, Velerad and Count de Wett are at his disposal as trusted advisors of the court and then dismisses him telling the witcher that he will summon him again later to speak (...at his whim, presumably. Monarchs can be so rude!)
Geralt takes the opportunity to converse with the royal advisors. After consulting each of them, he decides to explore the castle a bit more. A group of courtiers is dancing and watching them is a noblewoman who seems to be alone. The witcher introduces himself and learns that his newest acquaintance is Antoinnette, from the duchy of Toussaint.
She suspects they have met before, but amnesiac as our hero remains, he has no memory of the event and just shrugs off the idea. Undeterred, Antoinnette cuts to the chase and asks the witcher if he would be willing to render a small service, in return for a reward, of course. Geralt agrees and bids her farewell. Just then, he is summoned once again to speak with Foltest, but this time in the regent's private chambers.
The two revisit the tasks at hand and the king gives Geralt leave to kill Adda, if necessary, but admonishes him that this should be done only as a last resort and must absolutely spare the princess any pain or suffering. Otherwise, Foltest tells the witcher that his friends will suffer a similar fate. He then takes a moment to sneak in a little chit chat about women and a quick round of dice poker and then sends our hero on his way, telling him to speak with the chamberlain about travel arrangements back to Old Vizima.
Once back in the old part of town, Geralt is met by White Rayla. She explains that Siegfried is at the field hospital being tended by Shani and that they must reach to get further instructions, but the path is blocked by all the fighting in the streets. She tells the witcher that she bets he can not kill as many Scoia'tael as she has. Her current count stands at twenty squirrel tails. The witcher takes her bet and soon has enough tails to win that little wager. A few choice words are exchanged as the two realize they have made it to the hospital. Mission accomplished.
... or is it? Geralt barely has time to speak to Shani (a potentially hostile encounter depending on his actions regarding Alvin's care in Chapter III) that a militiaman bursts in looking for a witcher. He immediately spies our hero and begs him to follow him to a part of town where it seems the striga has been cornered. Geralt obliges and follows the man, but the creature he finds looks nothing like a striga, which is not to say that it does not look dangerous.
The creature leaps from its perch on the solitary tower and the battle is on. The witcher springs into action and after a tough battle, kills the monster. Then, much to his surprise, he spies his old friend Kalkstein observing the proceedings. The two exchange a few pleasantries but quickly determine that the creature was most definitely not a striga, but a likely a mutant. Having dispatched the immediate threat, Geralt decides to head back to the hospital to speak to Shani some more.
His second attempt is no more success as the hospital is attacked by Scoia'tael commandos hell bent on getting rid of the "human filth". Once again, the battle is on and Geralt must route quite a few Scoia'tael, but as expected, he does.
Phases.
The Knights' Intentions.
The knights of the Order and the Scoia'tael are battling in Old Vizima. Zoltan mentioned some nonsense about the Order's evil intentions. I should make sure they're not killing civilians. "I must make sure the knights of the Order aren't killing civilians."
Rayla.
I ran into White Rayla in the streets of Old Vizima. We must get to the hospital where Siegfried is a patient. Rayla suggested a bet: she thinks she can kill more Scoia'tael than me. Her tally so far is twenty. "I bet Rayla that I could kill more Scoia'tael than her. I need to collect squirrel tails as proof."
Winning the Bet / A Talk with Shani.
Compete with Rayla:
I think I've killed more Scoia'tael than Rayla has. Time to see Siegfried at the hospital. "Time to see Siegfried at the hospital."
A Talk with Shani.
Rayla refuses to believe I've killed more Scoia'tael than she has. We'll see about that later. I need to speak to Shani first. "I need to speak to Shani first." ( + 3000 XP)
Refuse such nonsense:
I refused to take part in Rayla's elf killing spree. More important things on my mind. I really need to speak with Shani. "I'd better go talk to Shani."
Striga.
I met Shani at the hospital, but we were interrupted by a messenger who told us that a striga was seen in town. I have to tend to the monster. "First and foremost, I must deal with the striga."
To the Hospital.
I slew the striga... Now back to the hospital. Shani and I need to have a conversation, in relative calm. "I can now return to the hospital and speak with Shani."
The Scoia'tael Assault.
The Scoia'tael have overrun the hospital. I must defend the wounded. "I must defend the wounded against the Scoia'tael."
Scoia'tael Lay Siege to the Hospital.
I killed a group of attacking Scoia'tael. Others have surrounded the hospital. I need to tend to them. "I must face the Scoia'tael outside the hospital." (3000 XP)
White Rayla in Need.
The Scoia'tael have surrounded White Rayla by the hospital. I must help her! "I must help White Rayla. She's near the hospital."
An Invitation.
White Rayla and I easily dealt with the Scoia'tael commando. She's invited me to join her in the command post she established in a nearby building. "Rayla invited me into her hideout."
A Talk with Rayla.
Follow the knight outside and skip the sex. (2000 XP)
We are going to assume positions on the barricade. I need to speak with White Rayla first. "I need to have a word with White Rayla." (4000 XP)
Taking the Barricades.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Her Highness the Striga is a quest in Chapter V given to Geralt by Foltest himself.
Walkthrough.
This quest is initiated when the King asks the witcher personally to deal with the matter of his daughter's curse. The regent even goes so far as to tell Geralt that he may kill Adda if there seems to be no way to lift the curse. Our hero had better make no mistake though, if Foltest finds out that the Princess suffered in any way, he will exact the same on the witcher's friends.
Armed with this knowledge, Geralt sets off for the Swamp Cemetery and the Striga's crypt. Just outside the crypt, he meets Velerad who seems anxious to speak with him. There are also several city guardsmen just hanging around, or so it would seem. The burgomeister tells Geralt that the King has sent word that the Princess's sarcophagus, conveniently located inside her crypt, should be searched for evidence. Velerad then asks the witcher to follow him into the crypt.
Geralt complies, but as soon as he is inside the crypt, he hears the gate being locked behind him. Velerad has trapped him inside with no means of escape. The burgomeister assures the witcher that he will be released after the "beastie" is dealt with. Charming! Having no other options, our hero sets about getting ready for battle. Cat potion? Check! It is dark as pitch in the crypt.
The witcher makes his way toward the chamber where Adda's sarcophagus is located. Just outside, he finds a campfire and takes the opportunity to meditate and prepare, waiting until the evening. The striga is reported to appear only after dark. Around 21h00 he enters her chamber.
On cue, the striga rises and it appears that the beneficial effects of any previous snacks have worn off completely. She is hungry and witcher meat is as good as any.
Lift the curse:
Geralt uses his quen sign to protect himself and manoeuvres his way over to the sarcophagus. He finds a spot where the striga can not see him and waits. One candle... Two candles... When the fifth and final candle goes out, he hears the crowing of a cock. It is over, the curse is lifted. The witcher makes his way over to the princess and helps her out of the chamber.
Kill the striga:
It is a pitched battle, but in the end there can be only one outcome: one dead striga.
Geralt searches the sarcophagus. There he finds Ostrit's diary and a few more pieces of the puzzle fall into place. It seems that someone has been using the information in this diary to re-cast the curse on the princess. The same curse that Geralt had lifted many years earlier. He searches the rest of the crypt, making sure he has not missed any useful items and then makes his way toward the exit. The gate is unlocked as in either case, had he lifted the curse or killed the striga, there would be no fear of the striga appearing in daylight.
Once outside, Velerad greets the witcher and seems genuinely happy that he has survived.
Lifted the curse:
The burgomeister can see that the princess has regained human form and takes charge of getting her back to the castle. He also rewards Geralt for lifting the curse with a fine steel sword, D'yaebl.
Killed the striga:
The burgomeister thanks the witcher for his help, commenting that he should have killed the striga earlier and for more gold.
Velerad then gives our hero a message from the king: go to the Old Manor, if you want to cure the disease. That disease being Salamandra, of course. So it is off to the Old Manor and hopefully, finally, some answers. Geralt makes his way south through the swamp cemetery towards to the road to the Old Manor. He has barely left the cemetery behind when whom should he meet but Count Roderick de Wett and a few knights of the Order.
The two exchange a few (not so) pleasantries when the subject turns to the striga. De Wett seems overly anxious to know if the striga has been killed. Geralt is circumspect and says only that the problem has been dealt with and that an interesting and informative diary was recovered in the process. This is where the count makes his first big mistake. He sloppily refers to the diary as "Ostrit's diary". Knowing full well that he never mentioned Ostrit, the witcher realizes that Roderick knows far too much not to have been involved.
Geralt confronts the count, demanding an explanation. De Wett seems only too happy to explain himself and reveals that he is actually working with Salamandra, for now. It is his ultimate plan to outsmart them and he invites the witcher to join him. Geralt is quite rightly appalled at the idea and the two duel. It is not really a fair fight as there are only four of them against a witcher.
With the count dead, the path to the Old Manor is clear, so our hero forges onward, after making sure to search the fresh bodies for information. He fights his way through drowners and drowned dead, bloedzuigers, Dagon worshippers and priests, and every conceivable variety of mutant until he reaches the Old Manor.
Fate smiles on him as he is joined by an ally who helps him enter the catacombs beneath the manor by fending off the remaining mutants at the entrance. Inside, the path is not easy however, but the witcher perseveres and keeps steadily approaching his goal: Javed's laboratory. He finds the lab, but not before battling many more mutants, armoured hounds, a koshchey and a pair of greater brothers. Javed is dispatched and the Grand Master is uncovered as the true mastermind behind the nefarious Salamandra organization.
Our hero then meets up once again with his trusty ally and heads back to Vizima by means of a boat secured by the latter. Once in Vizima, the burning remains of the Temple Quarter to be exact, Geralt informs the king of the Princess's fate.
Gallery.
 
Phases.
Consultations.
The King left me with Triss, Velerad, and De Wett. He wants me to consult them before we meet again. Princess Adda has turned into a striga once again, and I need to figure out what to do. The king will summon me again soon. "I must speak with Triss, Velerad, and De Wett."
The Story of the Striga.
Velerad reminded me of the story of the striga. He doesn't know where the monster sleeps during the day, but she was seen in Old Vizima. I'll look for her there. "The striga sleeps in daytime, but apparently she has been seen in Old Vizima."
The Fruit of Incest.
De Wett believes the king wishes to be rid of the striga. Her appearance has reminded people that Adda was the fruit of an incestuous union. "Adda was born of an incestuous union between the king and his sister."
Betrayal.
Triss believes someone from Adda's entourage caused her [to] turn once again into a striga. "It's possible that someone "helped" Adda turn into a striga."
Royal Counselors.
I spoke to Triss, Velerad, and De Wett. I think I know where I stand. "I spoke to Triss, Velerad, and De Wett. The king will summon me soon."
An Agreement with the King.
Foltest was quite clear. If I botch thing with the striga and she suffers, my friends will suffer too. If, on the other hand, I manage to lift the curse, I can expect a reward. If Adda dies, quickly and painlessly [], I'll neither gain nor lose anything. I'm to speak with the chamberlain to return to Old Vizima. "If I want to return to Old Vizima, I should speak with the chamberlain."
In Vizima.
I'm in Old Vizima. Hmm.. What now? I should go on and look for clues as to the striga's whereabouts. "I should move on and search for clues as to the striga's whereabouts."
Striga in the City.
A soldier ran up and told me that the striga was seen by the tower. I should check out the situation. "The striga was spotted near the tower. I should go there and look around." (3000 XP)
The Mutant.
Kalkstein claims the monster I killed was no striga, but a mutant. He did hear rumors of a striga tearing someone to bits near the old chapel in the swamp. I must find a way to get there... But first I should make sure my friends are all right. "I should see my friends and consider what to do next." ()
The Real Striga.
Kalkstein related some gossip about a real striga tearing someone to bits near the old chapel in the swamp. I should go there and have a look. "I should look for the striga near the old chapel in the swamp cemetery."
A Father in Despair.
I met a strange man in the swamp. In spite of fearing monsters, he waits day and night for his son to return. He claims the striga emerges nightly from the crypt beneath the church. I must go there after dusk and face her. I can also try and lift the curse that holds her. To do that, I must remain near her sarcophagus till daybreak, somehow survive the night. "I must go to the crypt after dusk and face the striga."
Proof.
I found the journal of Ostrit, who first cursed Adda years ago. The journal details many spells and proves almost conclusively that someone intentionally re-cast the curse, turning Adda into a striga once more. "I have proof. Now to get out of this damned crypt... "
Ostrit's Journal.
I found Ostrit's journal in the striga's sarcophagus. It proves someone intentionally restored the curse. I hope to find the culprit. I should tell the king what I know when we next meet. "I'll tell the king of my discovery when we next meet."
De Wett.
De Wett! He used the spell from Ostrit's journal to turn Adda into a striga once again. He'll pay for his villainy. De Wett must die, the way to the Old Manor will then be clear. "I must kill De Wett, and the way to the Old Manor will be clear."
Crime and Punishment.
De Wett should've stayed out of my way. He paid for the suffering he caused Adda. When I next see the king, I'll tell him of De Wett's deeds. "When I next see the king, I'll tell him of De Wett's betrayal."
The King.
I told the king of De Wett's deeds. Though furious, he was glad that I killed the traitor. "I informed the king of De Wett's deeds. The king was furious." (6000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;
A Gnomish Device is a quest in Chapter V which Geralt undertakes if he chooses the Scoia'tael path. In this quest, he must find the bifunctional fiber and alloy recirculator in order to recreate Raven's armour.
Walkthrough.
After battling his way into Old Vizima and making sure Shani is fine, Geralt can then start exploring and it is not long before he finds the old forge where the dwarven blacksmith who is busily making and repairing armour and weapons for the Scoia'tael fighting in the streets. The witcher asks him if he can re-make Raven's armour. The blacksmith says he can, but only if he has the right pieces. He needs a bifunctional fiber and alloy recirculator and a few other pieces.
This strange mechanism is in an ancient crypt somewhere under the old mine in the swamp cemetery. After battling kikimores, fleders and ghouls, our hero will have to use a Wayfarer's stone hidden in a side corridor of the mine to access the crypt. The stone requires a series of three signs to open: Igni, then Igni again, followed by Aard. Our hero needs to stand not too far from the stone for signs to function properly, otherwise they won't trigger it.
Once inside, he will be set upon by alps, bruxae, wraiths, cemetaurs and fleders on the way to his goal, which is found in a dwarven trunk. Once the item has been secured, he simply needs to go back to the dwarven blacksmith with the part. Well OK, he will also need to get the notes of an elven minstrel, the remains of Raven's Armor and another piece of armor to actually seal the deal.
Phases.
All the Pieces.
The dwarf blacksmith told me to bring him pieces of both Raven's armor and the armor of a knight of the De Ruyter dynasty, then notes of an elven minstrel, and a bifunctional alloy and steel fiber recirculator. I'll find these items in the swamp cemetery. The ancient gnomish underground areas can be accessed through an old mine. Inside it, there is a stone at which I need to cast two fire spells and one air spell. "I must go to the swamp cemetery and find all the items required to create the armor."
The Bifunctional Recirculator.
I have the bifunctional alloy and steel fiber recirculator... I need to deliver it and the other pieces for the armor to the blacksmith. "I should get the bifunctional recirculator and the other elements for the armor to the blacksmith." (9000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Monoliths is a primary quest in Chapter II of "The Witcher" which is integral to opening the mysterious mage's tower, the object of Kalkstein's fascination. This quest becomes available after collecting all 10 Sephirot stones.
Walkthrough.
When Geralt first seeks out Kalkstein, after winning his freedom from the dungeon, he is given a quest, A Mysterious Tower. There is an abandoned Mage's tower in the swamp that Kalkstein very much wants to get into, so he needs the witcher's help. Over the course of the quest, our hero comes upon some strange looking obelisks scattered about the swamp and begins finding Sephirot.
After discussing this first quest and the subsequent findings, Kalkstein sends Geralt to find two books, The Secret Gates and Ain Soph Aur for more information. It is upon presenting the latter of these tomes that this quest, Monoliths, is spawned. It turns out that to get into the Mage's tower, the sephirot must each be placed in a corresponding obelisk, or monolith. Once all ten are in place, the tower should magically open.

I gathered all the Sephirot, the magic stones needed to open the entrance to the Mage's tower. "I must place the Sephirot in appropriate monoliths."

&lt;/infobox&gt;
What Lies Beneath is the quest where Geralt finally uncovers what really lies beneath his investigation. The witcher has been following the trails of Salamandra and in this quest, he finally gained a step ahead of Azar Javed.
Walkthrough.
After listening to the local private investigator, Raymond Maarloeve, our hero continues his investigation into the organization of Salamandra. As Geralt pokes around the Temple Quarter for evidence and interviews the suspects, one thing becomes clear: This investigation is not as straightforward as Raymond might wish. The witcher then figured that he should do some looking around of his own, in addition to the leads given to him. That is when this quest kicks in.
Depending on the direction of further investigations, this quest could end up being dormant for a really long time. It is only upon the discovery of a critical knowledge that topples the entire investigation does the quest enter the next phase:
"Major Spoiler:" The detective Raymond's identity has been assumed by Azar Javed! For simplicity and accuracy, this critical knowledge will be referred to as the "Grand Truth" from this point.
Currently there are 3 ways of achieving this:
Having learned the "Grand Truth", Geralt can now decide whether if he wanted to pressure Raymond a bit with a confrontation, like he does with all the suspects. But with or without a premature confrontation, Geralt certainly can't just simply barge in and cut off the head of the salamander in its own den. He must go find himself some allies for a final showdown on the witcher's own term.
Asking aid from some of the falsely accused, our hero eventually comes to Kalkstein, who proven to be just the person Geralt seeks. The two agreed to lure Azar to the tower in the swamp for the final confrontation.
With that, the quest comes to an end with Geralt continues to finish up his preparations, namely the opening of the tower, for the "Reunion" with Azar Javed in the swamp tower.
Phases.
Leads.
"This only appears if you started the quest before you've learned the "Grand Truth"."
This investigation is not as straightforward as Raymond might wish. Apparently not all the suspects are guilty. "I reckon I should search for leads on my own."
Azar the Detective.
"This appears whenever Geralt has learned the "Grand Truth". Its position with "Confrontation" may change depending on player actions."
I have irrefutable evidence that Azar Javed disguises himself as Raymond. This knowledge is dangerous indeed... I must be realistic, if I face Azar on his terms I will meet with certain death. "I must not confront Azar directly. I must seek support among some of the falsely accused." (500 XP)
Confrontation.
"This only appears if Geralt decided to confront Raymond. Its position with "Azar the Detective" may change depending on player actions."
I'm treading on thin ice - I need to disclose my suspicions to the detective but I don't want him to react violently. Not yet that is. I have to choose my words carefully. "I need to be careful with the detective." (1500 XP)
An Ally: Kalkstein.
Kalkstein has become my ally against Azar. We decided to use Salamandra's interest in the marsh tower and lure Azar into a trap. "We decided to use Salamandra's interest in the marsh tower and lure Azar into a trap." (2500 XP)

Long since abandoned by humans, the crypt in the fields outside Murky Waters has become home to a multitude of malignant forces. There are vampires, even garkains; there are necrophages, and their king, Ureus, the ancient cemetaur who has gone unchallenged... Not to mention alps, alghouls, ghouls, and a colony of 'bad' griggs.
Among the many chambers filled with sarcophagi, trunks and exposed corpses, there is also a circle of elements, the Circle of the Barren Lands and a chapel where the colony of griggs worships.

In the middle of the fields, an old, ruined mill stands, a constant reminder of what was, and how the horrors that now wander the meadows day and night keep the villagers from tending to the leas. There is a fireplace at the foot of the ominous building and climbing the rickety path of boards and barrels, one can reach the very top of the mill. The vista of the fields in all their glory is alone worth it. However, the midday bride haunts the place, too, for that is where she fell to her death.

Nehalenia's Mirror

Nehalenia's Mirrors, also known as Mirrors of Nehaleni, were magical artifacts with oracular abilities. Aridea, stepmother of Renfri Vellga and Fredefalk of Creyden's second wife, owned such a mirror.
...she came into possession of a rare and powerful artefact. One of Nehalenia's Mirrors. They're chiefly used by prophets and oracles because they predict the future accurately, albeit intricately. Aridea quite often turned to the Mirror—"
"With the usual question, I take it," interrupted Geralt. "Who is the fairest of them all?" I know, Nehalenia's Mirrors are either polite or broken."- Geralt and Stregobor,  pg. 85 - 87, "The Last Wish" (U.K. edition)
"The Witcher".
In Chapter IV, Alina, a girl from the village of Murky Waters, is said to have owned such a mirror — broken. It is not clear if she broke it herself or if it was always broken. If she did break it, then why she did so, no one knows, but finding the shards and mending the mirror is part of a quest that is required to finish the game.
In the game, the artefact is referred to as a "Mirror of Nehaleni".

Brugge was a small kingdom, now vassal state, on the Old Road. It is separated from its neighbors by the river Yaruga, its tributary Ribbon and the river Trava. Brugge is surrounded by Sodden to the east, Cintra to the south, Verden to the west, and Brokilon to the north.
Brugge was originally an independent kingdom before Cintra took over, making it a vassal state. After Queen Calanthe's death, Brugge became a vassal state to Temeria and was then ruled over by King Venzlav, who was a vassal to the Temerian king.
During the Second Northern War, Brugge was one of the kingdoms which suffered the most in the Nilfgaardian invasion.
History.
Northern Wars.
In 1263, during the First Northern War, many refugees left displaced from the Slaughter of Cintra travelled to Brugge for shelter. The war led to a large surplus of cheap Nilfgaardian wares travelling through Brugge into Temeria, where the competing cheap prices started to greatly damage the economy. King Foltest of Temeria knew he couldn't shut the borders between his kingdom and his new vassal state, as it would seriously anger the Merchant's Guild and affect trade relations between them, though the impact of this great takeover led to Nilfgaard's floren outing the local currency in certain areas of Brugge.
During the interwar period of late 1263 to early 1267, several Northern rulers agreed to outlaw and hunt the Scoia'tael from their lands, due to recent violent attacks from the nonhumans. In several instances, Bruggian troops attacked dryads mistaken for escaping elves, or those fighting alongside them, even sometimes venturing into Brokilon to hunt them. This angered Queen Eithné, who began an order to kill any humans found past Brokilon's borders.
In July 1267, after Foltest swore fealty to Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, one stipulation of Temeria's surrender meant Brugge was safe from Imperial occupation. This was broken less than a month later, in the form of several small raids conducted by the Imperials along the Bruggian border. From Drieschot, this was then followed by Nilfgaard's full invasion and occupation of the region, supported by several Scoia'tael commandos, such as Coinneach Dá Reo's. During this invasion, a notable battle took place in a local village near Owl Hills, the Bruggian infantry being soundly defeated by the Imperial Army in several calvary charges that were supported by the Verdenians and Scoia'tael. The remaining imperials then continued on and captured Dillingen, before their final march northeast and capitulation of the capital. The southern half of the kingdom remained in flames, meanwhile now under imperial occupation. Following were several attempts made by the Temerian Army to recapture Venzlav's kingdom, however they were unsuccessful.
War appeared in a less spectacular way than it had in Brugge and Sodden, where the horizon had glowed with fires at night, and during the day columns of black smoke had slashed the blue sky.pg. 301 "Baptism of Fire" (U.K. edition)

Erkyn von Blunt, otherwise known as Thaler's mute friend at A Posh Reception. Thaler says he has taken at least two vows: a vow of silence and a vow to protect the Royal Family, despite Adda's obvious contempt. What is his game? Perhaps a drink would loosen him up?
Geralt meets this fellow in Chapter III, during the posh reception at The New Narakort. He does not speak, at least not at first, and Thaler explains that von Blunt has designated him as his spokesman, considering that his vow does not permit him to speak and that he is hoping for an audience with Leuvaarden as well as the Princess.
A few tankards of any medium strength alcohol later and that vow is no more. Erkyn lets it slip that he is really just one of Thaler's boys who is "supposed" to be there incognito. He begs the witcher not to publicize his lamentable lapse in judgement and gives Geralt the House of the Night signet ring to keep quiet.

Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi

Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi, created by Effenberg and Talbot, is a multi-volume work detailing many notable people and occurrences throughout the history of the continent and the world in general. Fragments of this fictional book are sometimes used as introductions to stories or chapters in Sapkowski's works. It was generally considered to be a piece of Nilfgaardian propaganda and the information in it is highly selective, subjective and not particularly scientifically rigorous. Those fragments have, so far, apparently featured the following:
Excerpts.
 Congreve, Estella or Stella, the daughter of Baron Otto de Congreve, espoused to the Count of Liddertal, managed his estates extremely judiciously following his early death, owing to which she amassed a considerable fortune. Enjoying the great estimation of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis (q.v.), she was a greatly important personage at his court. Although she held no position, it was known that the emperor was always in the habit of gracing her voice and opinion with his attention and consideration. Owing to her great affection for the young Empress Cirilla Fiona (see also), whom she loved like her own daughter, she was jokingly called the 'empress mother'. Having survived both the emperor and the empress, she died in 1331, and her immense estate was left in her will to distant relatives, a side branch of the Liddertals called the White Liddertals. They, however, being careless and giddy-headed people, utterly squandered it.

 Delannoy, Flourens, linguist and historian b. 1432 in Vicovaro, in the years 1460–1475 secretary and librarian to the imperial court. Indefatigable scholar if legends and folktales, he wrote many treatises considered classics of ancient language and literature of the Empire's northern regions. His most important works are: "Myths and Legends of the Peoples of the North"; "Fairy Tales and Stories"; "The Surprise, or the Myth of the Elder Blood"; "A Saga about a Witcher", and "The Witcher and the Witcher Girl, or the Endless Search". From 1476 professor at the academy in Castell Graupian, where d. 1510."

 Evertsen Peter, b. 1234, confidant of Emperor Emhyr Deithwen and one of the true authors of the Empire's might. The chief chamberlain of the army during the time of the Northern Wars (q.v.), from 1290 imperial treasurer of the crown. In the final period of Emhyr's rule, he was raised to the rank of coadjutor of the Empire. During the rule of Emperor Morvran Voor he was falsely accused of misappropriation of funds, found guilty, imprisoned and died in 1301 in Winneburg Castle. Postumously rehabilitated by Emperor Jan Calveit in 1328."

 Houvenaghel, Dominik Bombastus, b. 1239, became rich in Ebbing conducting trade on a great scale and settled in Nilfgaard; respected by previous emperors, he was appointed burgrave and director of mines in Venendal by Emperor Jan Calveit, and as reward for services rendered was given the office of mayor of Neveugen. A faithful imperial advisor, H. had the emperor's favour and also participated in many public affairs. d. 1301. While still in Ebbing, H. was engaged in numerous charitable works, supported the needy and impoverished, and founded orphanages, hospitals and nurseries, putting up plentiful sums for them. A great enthusiast of the fine arts and sport, he founded a comedic theatre and stadium in the capital, both of which bore his name. He was regarded as a model of probity, honesty and mercantile decency.

 Kerack, a city in the northern kingdom of Cidaris, at the mouth of the River Adalatte. Once the capital of the independent kingdom of K., which, as the result of inept governments and the extinction of the royal line, fell into decline, lost its significance and became parcelled up by its neighbours and incorporated into them. It has a port, several factories, a lighthouse and roughly two thousand residents.

 Mandrake, or Love Apple, is a class of plant from the Mandragora or nightshade family, a group including herbaceous, stemless plants with parsnip-like roots, in which a similarity to the human form may be observed; the leaves are arranged in a rosette. M. autumnalis or officinalis, is cultivated on a small scale in Vicovaro, Rowan and Ymlac, rarely found in the wild. Its berries, which are green and later turn yellow, are eaten with vinegar and pepper, while its leaves are consumed raw. The root of the m., which is a valued ingredient in medicine and herb lore, long ago had great import in superstitions, particularly among the Nordlings; human effigies (called alruniks or alrunes) were carved from it and kept in homes as revered talismans. They were believed to offer protection from illnesses, to bring good fortune during trials, and to ensure fertility and uncomplicated births. The effigies were clad in dresses which were changed at each new moon. M. roots were bought and sold, with prices reaching as much as sixty florins. Bryony roots (q.v.) were used as substitutes. According to superstition, m. was used for making spells, magical philtres and poisons. This belief returned during the period of the witch hunts. The charge of the criminal use of m. was made, for example, during the trial of Lucretia Vigo (q.v). The legendary Philippa Alhard (q.v) was also said to have used m. as a poison.
Effenberg and Talbot, Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi,Volume IX pg. 103, "Baptism of Fire" (U.K. edition)
 Ithlina, actually Ithlinne Aegli: daughter of Aevenien, the legendary elven healer, astrologist and soothsayer, famous for her predictions and prophesies, of which Aen Ithlinnespeath, Ithlina's Prophecy, is the best known. It has been written down many times and published in numerous forms. The Prophecy enjoyed great popularity at certain moments, and the commentaries, clues and clarifications appended to it adapted the text to contemporary events, which strengthened convictions about its great clairvoyance. In particular, it is believed I. predicted the Northern Wars (1239–1268), the Great Plagues (1268, 1272 and 1294), the bloody War of the Two Unicorns (1309–1318) and the Haak Invasion (1350). I. was also supposed to have prophesied the climactic changes observed from the end of the thirteenth century, known as the Great Frost, which superstition always claimed was a sign of the end of the world and linked to the prophesied coming of the Destroyer (q.v.). This passage from I.'s Prophecy gave rise to the infamous witch hunts (1272–76) and contributed to the deaths of many women and unfortunate girls mistaken for the incarnation of the Destroyer. Today, I. is regarded by many scholars as a legendary figure and her 'prophesies' as very recently fabricated apocrypha, and a cunning literary fraud."
Effenberg and Talbot,Encyclopaedia Maxima Mundi, Volume X pg. 283, "Baptism of Fire" (U.K. edition)
 Vedymins, called witchers among the Nordlings (q.v.), a mysterious and elite caste of warrior-priests, probably an offshoot of the druids (q.v.). In the folk consciousness, they are endowed with magical powers and superhuman abilities; v. were said to fight evil spirits, monsters and all manner of dark forces. In reality, since they were unparalleled in their ability to wield weapons, v. were used by the rules of the north in the tribal fighting they waged with each other. In combat v. fell into a trance, brought on, it is believed, by autohypnosis or intoxicating substances, and fought with pure energy, being utterly invulnerable to pain, or even grave wounds, which reinforced the superstitions about their superhuman powers. The theory, according to which v. were said to have been the products of mutation or genetic engineering, has not found confirmation. V. are the heroes of numerous Nordling tales (cf. F. Delannoy, "Myths and Legends of the Nordlings")."

Verden is one of the minor kingdoms in the North, located at the very mouth of the river Yaruga, with Kerack and Brokilon on its northern borders and Cintra in the south, just on the other side of the river.
Until 1263, it was a vassal state of Cintra, but surrendered to the Nilfgaardian Empire at the beginning of the Second Northern War. Later, it would gain its independence and become a small kingdom.
Centuries later, in the age of colonization and piracy, Verden established a few forts on the Eastern Coast.

Northern Wars.
After the First Northern War in 1263, Verden received many refugees from nearby Cintra, left displaced after the massacre in the capital.
Following the war, a great amount of cheap Nilfgaardian goods started to flow through Verden into Temeria, greatly affecting the kingdom's economy. King Foltest of Temeria knew he couldn't shut the borders to Verden, as it would cause great outcry from the Merchant's Guild, and severely affect trade relations. This great takeover led to the local currency, ducats, being outed by Nilfgaard's floren in some areas of the kingdom.
In July 1267, after the breakout of the Second Northern War and the fall of Cintra, King Ervyll swore fealty to Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, surrendering and opening the strongholds at the mouth of the Yaruga. Nilfgaardian garrisons were installed in Nastrog, Rozrog and Bodrog, leaving Temeria vulnerable from the south. Ervyll retained his royal title, but Emhyr became his sovereign; Verden remained a kingdom but, de facto, became a Nilfgaardian province. The following month, on August 7th, the Nilfgaardian Army, supported by Verdenian and Scoia'tael cavalry, began a full-scale invasion of Brugge, started with a battle of the village near Owl Hills. 
National emblems.
In the 13th century, the coat of arms and flag of Verden depicted a chequi of gold and black. In earlier times, the chequi was sometimes depicted as of black and silver. The kingdom is also symbolized by two bull horns of black and gold.

Cidaris is a small kingdom on the western shore of the Continent and is ruled by King Ethain. The river Adalatte in the south forms a natural border between Cidaris, Bremervoord, and Kerack. East of the kingdom lies Temeria, west lies Bremervoord.
This vivid country owes its position and prosperity to maritime trade, shipbuilding industry, vine plantations and the rational use of the riches of the ocean.
History.
Northern Wars.
After 1263, following the First Northern War, a great amount of cheap Nilfgaardian goods started to flow through Cidarian ports into Temeria, greatly affecting the kingdom's economy. King Foltest of Temeria knew he couldn't shut the borders to Cidaris, as it would cause great outcry from the Merchant's Guild, and severely affect trade relations with Ethain.
In 1267, Ethain sent his fleet to defend the eastern coast, should the Nilfgaardians march past the Yaruga along the coast.
National emblems.
The coat of arms of the kingdom is: "per pale Argent and Azure, two sturgeons counterchanged". Members of the royal family however bear different arms: "Aquamarine, two escallops Argent, below a fossilized cidaris sea urchin Proper".

Antoinette was a noblewoman from Beauclair, Toussaint, that Geralt meets after his audience with the King at the Royal castle in the original game.
"The Witcher".
At the beginning of Chapter V. Her cousins, Buse, Corbin and Ramerot are in hiding in the refugee caves in the swamp cemetery after incurring the disfavour of the king and they are completely out of orens.
When Geralt speaks to Antoinette, she mentions that she recognizes Geralt because in her home many years ago, she saw him dancing all night with a sorceress that he was very fond of.
Geralt doubts this due to his inability to dance. Antoinette questions if all Witcher's have white hair; Geralt says he is the only one, and she says she must be confused because she remembers him dancing with a sorceress.

Salamandra base

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The Salamandra base (not to be confused with the three hideouts) is a large underground complex on two levels that Geralt finds himself and an ally, either Yaevinn or Siegfried, teleported to by Triss Merigold at the end of Chapter III. It is a series of caves connected by winding corridors. There are some less than structurally sound looking areas that require wooden trusses to support to tons of rock threatening to come crashing down.
It is the home of a kikimore colony, complete with their queen. The Salamandra took it over after figuring out a way to control the insectoids. There is also a circle of elements, the Circle of Waning Power tucked away not too far from Alvaro's Portal on the first level of the complex.

Roland Bleinheim

Roland Bleinheim was the leader of the Salamandra operation in the Swamp. It is his men who kidnapped innocent brickmakers and forced them to gather beggartick for the fisstech labs. Vaska described him as "an evil man" and specifically asked Geralt to kill him. His brother (apparently) ran a similar operation in the sewers of Vizima.

Gellert Bleinheim is the "drug lord" heading up the fisstech production operation for Salamandra in the Sewers beneath Vizima's Temple Quarter (Chapter III). The Fisstech lab is guarded by two thugs who ask Geralt for a password in order to enter. Geralt can tell them that "thorn" is the password and enter peacefully or he may opt to fistfight them and gain entrance that way.
After clearing the Fisstech lab, Gellert Bleinheim and his thugs are found at the Southmost part of the Sewers (where the tunnels form a "Y" on the map). He carries the Key to Salamandra code, which is used to decipher the Encrypted document found in the Fisstech lab.

Fistfighters in The Witcher

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
In "The Witcher", there are several quests that span the entire game. One of the most noteworthy is the Fistfight quest. At inns, taverns, and a cave in Chapter V, Geralt has an opportunity to challenge local pugilists, including the reigning champion, for gold or a chance at the "Title". You can fight most champions once only but everyone else is game for rematches. When betting against a fistfighter you can double or double-and-a-half the bet for maximum profit, but they will refuse to fight if you try to wager more than that.
Since winning is easy (see Fistfighting made easy), without further ado, the fighters are (in plot order):
Eskel

Fat Fred
Other Fighters
Fat Fred is accompanied by several fistfighters, many willing to "kick your arse and make money doing it!."

Butter Bean
Other Fighters
Butter Bean is accompanied by several fistfighters. Geralt also has a fistfight in the prison dungeon to secure his freedom (regardless of the outcome); the prisoner looks remarkably like Fat Fred.
Andrew Gablodda
Other Fighters
Andrew Gablodda is accompanied by several willing fistfighters. The bouncer at the House of the Queen of the Night will allow passage upstairs if beaten in a fistfight. Rozalind Pankiera's father, Hobbs, will allow access to his daughter's room (for Dandelion's lute) if defeated in a fistfight. Fistfighting is one way past the guards of the Fisstech lab in the sewers.

The Rock
Other Fighters
It is truly amazing that Julian and Dandelion can sleep at all given that boxing matches go on 24 hours a day, right next to their beds at the Country Inn in Murky Waters. Quite a few professional fistfighters use the back room to work out apparently.

Zdenek, the Champion

Radovid V the Stern (Polish: "Radowid V Srogi") was the king of Redania and a member of the Redanian Dynasty in the last quarter of the 13th century. His reign became, along with the witch hunts, one of the defining factors of the post-war period that followed the Peace of Cintra. Radovid was a polarizing figure: a brilliant strategist and a superb general to some, a paranoid madman to others. There were also many who took the middle view of his policies being harsh but justified.
He inherited his titles and estates as the only son of King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore. His two older sisters were Dalimira and Milena. Even though his father was assassinated in 1267, Prince Radovid didn't succeed him immediately because he was only twelve at the time and for several years the kingdom was governed by a Regency Council, under the influence of Duke Nitert and Count Sigismund Dijkstra, the then-spymaster of the Redanian Secret Service.
Radovid bore a deep aversion towards mages that stemmed from his father being secretly assassinated by an unknown elf at the behest of the sorceress advisor Philippa Eilhart, who then pulled strings from behind his back, ruled in his name and dominated and demeaned him throughout his youth.
Biography.
Early life.
Radovid was born in 1255 in Tretogor to the royal pair, King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore, as their third child. He grew up with two older sisters: Dalimira, informally known as Dalka, and Milena, who was known as Milka in a similar fashion. Dalka eventually dedicated her life to the priesthood after her failed engagement with King Foltest of Temeria, who instead chose to marry his own sister Adda, while Milka attended Aretuza to become a sorceress Millegarda.
When Prince Radovid was 9 years old he was formally engaged to Cirilla, Princess of Cintra, when she was 12. The engagement was formalized between his father and Queen Calanthe, Ciri's grandmother, but the king broke the engagement off after half a year without giving any explanation and Ciri and Radovid never even had a chance to talk to each other.
Regency years.
The ambassador knew that Dijkstra was exaggerating, but not inordinately. Prince Radovid was still a minor, Queen Hedwig distraught by her husband's tragic death, and the aristocracy intimidated, stupefied, at variance and divided into factions. Redanian situation in 1267, "Baptism of Fire"On the day of the outbreak of the Second Northern War with the Nilfgaardian Empire, his father had unexpectedly fallen victim to an elven assassin. A fact unknown to practically anyone was that it was Philippa Eilhart, at the time fighting on Thanedd Island, who hired the elf in order to gain more direct rule. Redania fell into chaos, as usually happens in such circumstances, and Queen Hedwig was not in a state to control things. The aristocracy started to organize itself into factions, attempting to tear some land out for each and every one of them. Several practically licked the boots of Nilfgaardian emissaries led by Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen and were ready to rule with Nilfgaardian blessing, only to be caught off guard and stopped by the famous Redanian Secret Service. There remained but a handful of those who were spared, those with important enough social status and armed might to maintain peace, like Duke Nitert.
Nitert was put in charge of the Regency Council appointed to save the realm from a total civil war and they managed to do so, by hanging everyone they deemed traitor in specially modified fortifications with internment camps - most infamous of which would be Drakenborg. Its members, however, overlooked their underage crown prince and none of the Northern Kingdoms' elites, not even Philippa who took it upon herself to raise him, expected him to grow into a firm monarch who would repay all humiliations he and his mother had suffered during the interregnum.
Beginnings of reign.
A king, who – after paying back all the insults borne by himself and his mother – would pass into the history as Radovid V the Stern. Radovid at Novigrad parade, "The Lady of the Lake"A young but decisive, unrelenting King Radovid V's deed quickly earned him the epithet of "the Stern".
He began his reign by taking care of various nobles who ruled on their lands rather independently from Tretogor. He proved a capable political actor, manipulating events to the advantage of both his own position and Redania's. He utilized Redania's famed spy network to foster links with multiple potential allies, picking and choosing as he saw fit while ensuring those discarded were destroyed. In all his political actions, he attempted to embody the idea that a king should be ruthless towards his foes and generous to his friends.
Time in Vizima.
Looking to secure relations with Temeria, Radovid made his way to the kingdom's capital of Vizima in 1270. However, while there he eventually came into contact with Salamandra through some "mutual acquaintances" and thought he could make use of the criminal organization but ultimately concluded not to do so. Despite this, the witcher Geralt of Rivia happened across some of the criminals communicating via a mirror with the king, who only revealed he wasn't backing the group before closing off communications with the witcher.
Eventually, though, his hideout was discovered by the witcher. The two conversed for a bit, with Radovid revealing why he was in Vizima before asking the witcher's opinion on Adda the White, who he was seeing as a possible way to combine the two royal families. The two then parted ways.
"If Geralt saves Adda:" With Adda's curse lifted once more, Radovid then proceeded to marry her to solidify the two kingdoms' union.
"If Geralt doesn't save Adda:" With no other way to combine the two kingdoms, Radovid returned to Redania to reign over by himself.
Consolidating his power.
Back from Temeria, Radovid V began to gather his armies and erect fortresses. To counter the sorceresses' rising power, he invited the Order of the Flaming Rose to Redania and granted them lands. He made several military reforms, espousing the idea that a soldier was only as good as their breastplate. He ensured that his armies were well-equipped, allowing his quartermasters as much gold as was needed to keep his infantry in solid armor. Aware that human soldiers were neither as strong as dwarves nor as dexterous as elves, identified their key advantage: their numbers. A mass of humans, led by a capable of commander, could overwhelm an individually superior force. His final military philosophy concerned the effectiveness of heavy cavalry, and he would suggest that any battlefield problem could be overcome by a gallant charge. These tactics would see him through several successful military campaigns, culminating in a subjugating nearly the entirety of the Northern Kingdoms and the defeat of the invading Nilfgaardian forces of Emhyr var Emreis' third invasion.
In July 1271, Radovid came to the deliberations at Loc Muinne, followed by a number of regular soldiers and knights of the Flaming Rose who were meant to ensure that peace talks remained peaceful, as well as step in if things did not go Redania's way. Shortly after arriving, the King imprisoned Philippa Eilhart with the help of Nilfgaardian delegation. To avenge his father, he had her eyes gouged out and meant to execute her before she escaped.
Third Northern War and further life.
When the Third Northern War broke out, Radovid remained the only monarch to have the strength to resist Nilfgaard. Taking advantage of this, during the winter break, he invaded a weakened Kaedwen and absorbed the Kaedwenian Army into his own. He also had Temerian partisans and Kovirian mercenary companies at his disposal, and considered utilizing the Crescent Moon, an influential independence movement in the Nilfgaard-conquered Nazair.
However, both Radovid and Emhyr had set their eyes on Novigrad, as whoever controlled the free city would not only have control over the ports, but its hefty treasury as well, therefore making victory likely for the one who gained control of it. To try and weaken the city for his taking, Radovid employed the services of Whoreson Junior, one of the "Big Four" of Novigrad's underground crime bosses, enticing him with money and a grand estate in Oxenfurt in return for turning on the other bosses and bringing about their downfall.
His plan worked to a degree, but once it was clear that Junior had outlived his usefulness, Radovid decided to reveal his location to Geralt - who sought revenge on Whoreson Junior for unrelated reasons. However, Radovid took advantage of this and called upon Geralt for a favour; while onboard his flagship, the HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor, Radovid asked the witcher for his help in finding and apprehending Philippa Eilhart.
&lt;tabber&gt;
Alive (default)=
In the end, Radovid managed to defeat the invading Nilfgaardian forces, winning the Third Northern War. With this victory, Radovid absorbed all of the North - including Novigrad - into his own empire, resulting in him being known as the "Protector of the North". Under his lead, during the so called Iron Judgment, the Redanian Army continued the territories expansion, clashing against Mahakaman and Aedirnian troops and even against Skelligers fleet in the Great Sea.
Perhaps the most defining feature of Radovid's reign was his policy of relentless witch hunts. All over the North, groups such as mages, non-humans, herbalists and soothsayers were burned at the stake in mass numbers. Radovid seemingly lived up to an elderly age and was remembered in the history as Radovid the Stern. Many listed him alongside Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart as one of the key people responsible for the witch hunts.
Sometime later on, while his ship was anchored in Novigrad, Radovid was approached by many others claiming to know where Philippa was, but seeing through these lies, he dealt brutal punishments to the deceivers, from having them blinded, their tongues and fingers cut off, or drowned. Geralt subsequently approached him, claiming to have found her location: St. Gregory's Bridge. After being provided proof in the form of Vizimir's ring, which Philippa had used to pass decrees in the late king's name, Radovid and his soldiers set off for the bridge at once.
However, the king turned on the witcher, claiming that he irritated him, and ordered his men to kill him. The witcher was ultimately saved by the timely arrival of Temerian guerrillas, who ambushed the area and thusly caused Radovid to flee. At the last house, the monarch banged on the door to open up, but was stunned when Philippa opened the door to greet him; the sorceress then proceeded to blow powder in Radovid's face, blinding him and leaving him in agonizing pain, before she thrusted a dagger in his back, killing the king.
&lt;/tabber&gt;
Legacy.
A beverage known as Redanian Herbal was called "stern" in honor of Radovid.
"When Radovid's father, Vizimir II, had fallen victim to an assassin a few years earlier, the prince had had but thirteen summers. The country fell into chaos, as usually happens in such circumstances, and queen Hedwig would not have been able to control things. The aristocracy, as they tend to, started to organize themselves into factions, attempting to tear something out for themselves. Some practically licked the boots of Nilfgaardian emissaries, doing so with much practice and a real sense of commitment. The Regency Council appointed to save the kingdom from the conflict managed to do so, and properly hung the traitors, yet its members disregarded their underage ruler. Therefore nobody among the Redanian nobles expected that Radovid would grow up to become a firm monarch who would repay all humiliations he and his mother had suffered during the regency. The king was quick to show that, if his father had earned the moniker of"the Just", he would be remembered by history as "the Stern"."
If Geralt chooses Iorveth's path during the end of chapter I:
"The sorceress Philippa Eilhart had the dubious pleasure of seeing the aptness of Radovid's moniker with her own eyes, so to speak. After presenting her with a list of charges, reinforced with personal animosity and information from the Imperial envoy, the king had her eyes put out. You might say that Radovid couldn't turn a blind eye to her sins."
"Even before Geralt related his impressions of the discussion with Radovid to me, I already had an feeling that it would be best to avoid attracting the Redanian monarch's interest to my modest self. When Geralt ended up in his dungeon, the king unhesitatingly provided him with a list of arguments detailing why it was in Redania's national interest that the future be deeply unpleasant for the witcher and Triss. He did point out, however, that it was nothing personal."
"Unlike the proud and sometimes self-centered Foltest, or the fitful, coarse Henselt, the king of Redania was a reserved, calculating politician. Geralt learned that he was not the sort of man that would allow himself to be deceived or led astray by prevarication. The king could instantly sense falsehoods and was gifted at maneuvering his opponents into revealing whatever information he desired."
"Radovid had very specific plans concerning his neighbor, the chaos-riddled Temeria. With the prospect of another war against Nilfgaard looming, he and the Kaedweni monarch aimed to partition Temeria in order to forestall the Empire from acquiring its lands."
If Geralt chooses Roche's path during the end of chapter I:
"Radovid wanted to use Geralt to recover Anaïs La Valette, King Foltest's youngest child. Although she was oblivious to the fact, the girl was a trump card in a high-stakes game. The prize: Foltest's legacy."
If Geralt chooses to give Anaïs La Valette to him:
"Radovid had very specific plans concerning his neighbor, the chaos-riddled Temeria. In this situation Fate, embodied by a certain witcher and a military captain, had delivered Anaïs La Valette, Foltest's illegitimate daughter, into his hands. Thus the Redanian king had a strong argument that Temeria should be acknowledged a Redanian protectorate. Thanks to skillful political maneuvering, Radovid greatly strengthened himself and his kingdom's position."
If Geralt chooses to give Anaïs La Valette to John Natalis:
"Radovid had very specific plans concerning his neighbor, the chaos-riddled Temeria. Yet Fate, embodied by a certain witcher and a military captain, had delivered Anaïs La Valette, Foltest's illegitimate daughter, into the hands of Temeria's regent, John Natalis. Radovid would have to find some other way to expand his dominion."
 "It did not take long for King Radovid of Redania to prove himself a hard and ruthless ruler, one fully deserving to be styled "the Stern." His father, King Vizimir, was murdered when Radovid was quite young, and his mother, Hedwig of Malleore, and a Regency Council ruled in his stead."
 "Young Radovid soon seized power in his own right, however, and wrought vengeance on those who had treated him with disrespect. He took to forcing all his potential political opponents to swear allegiance – or face death."
 "He waged war not only against Nilfgaard, but also against mages, whom he saw as the root of all evil. Radovid also made every effort to gain control over the Free City of Novigrad, whose fleet and treasury could tip the scales of the ongoing conflict towards Radovid's victory."
 "Geralt's meeting with Radovid confirmed the rumors circling around the king's mental state. The Redanian king was a dangerous madman trapped in his own world of disturbing visions. This did not make him one jot less intelligent or cunning, however."
 "Despite his mental afflictions, the young king was manipulating his opponents like an adroit puppet master."
 "Radovid burned with particularly intense hostility (first kindled in his earliest childhood days) for the sorceress Philippa Eilhart. Rumors spoke of how he had prepared a special torture regimen just for her - and while the two dozen points they mentioned were surely an exaggeration, they accurately conveyed the general scale of his hatred."
 If Geralt completes Reason of State:
 "The terror of Radovid's reign had led not just enemies, but also his allies and even his subjects to long for his death."
 "The phrase "monster in human flesh" fit Radovid the Stern perfectly. Perhaps it was awareness of all the cruel and bestial acts this madman perpetrated that led the witcher to get involved in the plans for his assassination."
 "Hatred for Philippa Eilhart proved to be Radovid's weakness. He was ready to do anything to capture her - even abandon the safe confines of his flagship."
 "The plan for luring Radovid out of hiding worked, though not without complications. Irritated by Geralt's typical cheek, Radovid brayed for the witcher's blood, and Geralt only dodge the executioner's axe thanks to the intervention of his co-conspirators."
 "Perhaps the delay this caused was what allowed the ruler to nearly escape his assassins, but in the end he could not cheat fate and died at the hands of Philippa Eilhart, who descended suddenly, a veritable demon of vengeance, to revenge the wrongs he had done her."

Hedwig of Malleore was a princess of Malleore, the wife of Vizimir II, queen of Redania, and the mother of Radovid V, Dalimira, and Milena. Theoretically, after the death of her husband, she took over as regent of the kingdom until her son became of age, but in actual fact, the Regency Council held the true power and it was governed by Philippa Eilhart and Sigismund Dijkstra.
Biography.
Serving as regent.
On the night of June 30th 1267, her husband Vizimir was murdered by an elven assassin in the capital. Following his death and Hedwig's ascension to queen regent, she began gaining control of the chaos in the kingdom with the help of Philippa Eilhart, Triss Merigold, Keira Metz, Margarita Laux-Antille, and other mages left displaced by their ruler's newfound hostility.

The Witcher inventory

This inventory is quite different from most RPG orientated games. Because it does not allow you to store any , or other overly large random items. Instead, it revolves around the fact that you carry a satchel in which you can merely place smaller odds and ends like , food, drinks, , scrolls, etc... and also just a limited number of these items, though that limit is reasonably large. The inventory is divided up in general sections each consisting of small compartments, or slots in which a single can be stored.
General.
To access items, open the inventory by left-clicking on the satchel icon, or by pressing the I-key.
Tip: Drag and drop potions into quickslots to create shortcuts on the main screen providing quicker access to potions.
Trophy hook.
The hook or trophy slot, where Geralt can keep one trophy head at a time. Nothing else can be kept there.
Note
If you happen to have a trophy head on you when you upgrade to Raven's armor, that trophy head will fall to the floor and must be retrieved before proceeding.
Quest items pocket.
The quest items inventory pocket is the part of your Inventory screen which contains a side-scrolling list of all items with the special status of "" during gameplay. You can neither add nor remove items items to or from this section of your inventory, other than to click on an item to give it to another game character for the purposes of a . This seemingly small section actually contains an unlimited number of slots.
Satchel and alchemy sack.
This is all the stuff that Geralt carries. Since the introduction of the , the main inventory has been divided into two sections: the satchel and the alchemy sack. The satchel is the main storage compartment in Geralt's inventory. It holds all the items which can be picked up, excluding weapons, alchemical ingredients and quest items. The alchemy sack holds all herbs, minerals and monster parts, except additional goods. Prior to the Enhanced Edition, alchemical ingredients were kept in the satchel and there was no separate alchemy sack. An image of that inventory can be found .
The satchel is now divided into three sub-compartments (there were four), each has 14 slots, for a total of 42 slots. There is also a sort button to the left now to sort like items. It holds:
The alchemy sack has another three compartments the same size as the satchel, making for a further 42 slots. It also has a sort button and a very handy basic substance identifying button. It holds:
There are now an additional 28 slots for general inventory, a 50% improvement.
Individual items may or may not stack. For example, rings do not stack, but necklaces and do. The maximum number of items in a stack varies.
There are also other reasons why some items will not stack. One example is potions: Potions with a secondary ingredient as dominant substance will not stack with similar potions lacking the dominant substance (simply put, some potions refuse to stack and this is why). In fact, some water will not stack with other water... makes you wonder...
Geralt's body.
Geralt's body functions as the fourth compartment of his inventory. It is where weapons, armor and jewellery are kept or worn. For instance, his swords are strapped to his back, daggers are in a thigh-holster, and so forth.

Old Road

The Old Road is an ancient route that goes from Sodden to Brugge through Temeria. It was once very important, but now lies in ruins, since humans used part of it to rebuild what was destroyed during the First Northern War.

Kehl was a mercenary and, for a short time, leader of the Koshchey's Men.
Biography.
Kehl was a long-time mercenary who gained much experience over his life.
At one point in the 12th century, he joined the band formed by renegade druid Fregenal. They became feared in the settlements of Klamat pass. After realizing their differing intentions, Kehl and seventeen other members of the band turned on their leader. They killed the rest and left tied Fregenal in a cave. Kehl became a new leader and decided to leave the area for good.
Later, Kehl returned to aid Visenna and Korin kill the koshchey summoned by Fregenal. He rode against the abomination with warcry, sword in hand. Koshchey grabbed Kehl's horse and threw it away but the brave werebbubb swooped under it and stabbed the monster in one of its limbs. Angry and wounded, koshchey picked Kehl from the ground and massacred him.
After the battle was finished, mortally-injured Kehl asked Visenna to help him into the afterlife. With eyes full of tears, Visenna fulfilled his wish. The werebbubb twitched, shivered and passed away.

These five kurgans (or barrows), located next to the Hermit's hut south of the Fields, are all that remains of the Lady of the Lake's champions. But what is that? There is an empty one...
Of the four that are not empty, they contain the remains of knights who died serving the Lady over the ages.
The last kurgan awaits a new champion.
The hermit says that late at night, one can speak with the spirits of the Lady's champions.

Berengar's medallion

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
"An amulet radiating powerful magic."
Berengar's amulet is found on his corpse if Geralt chooses to challenge him to a duel on Black Tern Island at the end of Chapter IV, since naturally, Geralt wins. (If he did not, you have given up prematurely; reload and fight him again!) The amulet disconcerts Azar when he notices it, dangling from the witcher's neck presumably, during his "evil overlord" pre-victory speech.
Of course, Geralt can choose "not" to fight Berengar, but then he does not get this amulet. Instead, Berengar shows up to help him fight Azar Javed in his laboratory in the catacombs at the end of Chapter V.
Notes.
If you do spare Berengar's life, you earn more xp than by killing him. Later he does help you against Azar, but there he is not much help and is usually killed very quickly by the mage. For those hardy souls who manage to keep him alive for the duration of that battle, there is no extra dialogue nor reward for doing so.

Margarita Laux-Antille was a sorceress and a rector of Aretuza. She was also the granddaughter of the famous Ilona Laux-Antille and a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. She had no interest in politics, but she cared deeply for her school and students.
She had a figure outshining statues, fair-haired, tall, and often wore a green dress with a plunging neckline.
Biography.
Relationship with Lars.
In 1263, Margarita met Lars, and the two quickly developed a passionate relationship. For four years, their connection slowly dissolved and Margarita felt isolated in her thoughts. This, and his ongoing marriage to another woman, led Margarita to finally end things. Later, Tissaia assumed that this humiliating break up may have been the reason why Margarita would chose not to attend the banquet at Aretuza.
Meeting Ciri.
On June 30, 1267, after moving the adepts to different sleeping areas due to needing the dormitories for the upcoming Grand Mage's Conclave, several students escaped to the main city to indulge in its delights. Margarita and Tissaia de Vries searched the city, detecting a magical interference nearby. They found Ciri and Fabio Sachs hiding from an angry crowd; and believing she was one of the missing students, Tissaia put her under a paralysis spell while Margarita held off Fabio. They took the young clerk's advice and carried the girl to Giancardi Bank, where Yennefer of Vengerberg proved Ciri's identity, followed by constant apologies from the rectors. They all, save Fabio, went back to The Silver Heron inn, and bathed for several hours, until Ciri decided to flee to Hirundum, followed by Yennefer.
Fall of the Brotherhood.
The following day, the whole Brotherhood of Sorcerers met on Thanedd Island but that evening, a large-scale coup took place between the mages allied with the North and those with Nilfgaard, resulting in numerous mages being killed or captured, and spelling the end of the Brotherhood. Despite remaining neutral, with mages now distrusted by many of the rulers, Margarita escaped to Philippa Eilhart's castle, Montecalvo, where she, alongside Keira Metz and Triss Merigold, attempted to assist Queen Hedwig to regain control of Redania.
Formation of the Lodge.
On August 5th, the four used a projection spell to begin their first true meeting, mainly around recruitment and their purpose, summoning Assire var Anahid, Sabrina Glevissig, Sheala de Tancarville, and Francesca Findabair. Despite initial disagreements over the events of Thanedd, they agreed to work together to protect the safe practice of magic. Backed by Margarita's evidence of women performing better with magic (based off comparing pupils from Aretuza and Ban Ard), they agreed women would only be allowed to join.
Deireadh Prison.
On the 6th of Birke, or around March 20, 1272, she was captured by witch hunters during the raids in Novigrad. She kept silent in interrogation, admitting no guilt, and so the torture was increased.
"".
Margarita Laux-Antille is mentioned by ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, as one of the sorceresses accused to be a member of the conspiracy, which murdered both King Demavend and Foltest. She is also sentenced to death, as were the other members of the Lodge of Sorceresses.
She is also mentioned by Geralt as co-author of the compendium "Masters of Magic on Curses – Selected Writings", with Tissaia de Vries.
After the massacre at Loc Muinne, Margarita, along with the other Northern Lodge sorceresses, went into hiding. However, she still kept in contact with Philippa and the two discussed a plan in hopes to reform the Lodge. However, those plans were put on hold. Fearing witch hunters would inevitably attack Aretuza, Margarita and her students went to Novigrad, hearing Triss was organizing an escape for mages to Kovir. Sadly, she and her students were captured and imprisoned, and her pupils were burned one by one, with Radovid saving Margarita for last. Luckily, she was rescued by Geralt and Yennefer before her execution.
"The full list of Margarita Laux-Antille's outstanding mental, spiritual and physical attributes would consume a mountain of parchment. Rita, as her friends called her, once held the position of rector at the Aretuza Academy for Sorceresses on the Isle of Thanedd - the same school attended by her famous ancestor, Ilona Laux-Antille."
"Quite unusually for one of her profession, Margarita showed no interest in politics - it was only care for the good of her school that led her to join the Lodge of Sorceresses."
"Finally, her beauty deserves mention as well. It was said that not even the marble likenesses of goddesses and nymphs chiseled out by the greatest sculptors could rival this sorceress's figure."
"Yet with all her astuteness, Laux-Antille still could not escape the same fate that so many of her fellows met. She had been arrested some time before our tale begins and was staying in the Oxenfurt prison, awaiting a summary and pre-determined trial."
"Only Geralt and Yennefer's daring jailbreak saved Margarita from certain execution."

Keira Metz of Carreras was a sorceress and former advisor to King Foltest of Temeria, a role that had also been held by Triss Merigold and Fercart.
Biography.
Keira was born in the city of Carreras, although little is known about her early life. From a young age, Keira studied at the Academy of Aretuza where she was trained in the arts of magic and eventually became a sorceress.
Thanedd banquet.
In early 1267, Keira was serving as King Foltest's advisor when she and other mages in the North learned some of their fellow mages were planning to betray the Brotherhood of Sorcerers for Nilfgaard. Armed with this information, a conclave was called on Thanedd Island under the pretense of figuring out what they should do in regards to their positions as advisors to various rulers. In reality, Keira along with several others, including Philippa Eilhart and Sabrina Glevissig, planned a coup of their own to try and prevent the Nilfgaard supporters from putting their coup into play first.
On June 30th, she attended the banquet the night before the conclave and met Geralt, who'd been brought along by Yennefer, and the two conversed for a bit, with the witcher joking that he had created the caviar illusion and her noting she didn't want to drink as she planned "to get pregnant tonight" before Marti Södergren butted in and the trio further discussed trivial matters before Keira walked off to talk with other mages there.
Thanedd Coup.
However, Keira's real reason for not wanting to drink that night was to prevent herself from falling asleep. While everyone else headed off to bed, the Northern supporters planned to stay awake to arrest the traitors. As dawn approached, they made their move and Keira, with assistance from Sigismund Dijkstra and some of his Redanian soldiers, began to apprehend the traitors. As they were in the process of capturing Artaud Terranova, Geralt stumbled upon them but the soldiers held him off while Terranova was handcuffed, but not before the mage insulted Keira who, in turn, punched him with brass knuckles straight to the face. On seeing Geralt, she demanded that they guard him and hurried off before returning with Detmold, wondering what to do about the witcher. After deciding Philippa could decide, the two mages then hurried off to continue the arrests. A short time later, Keira and Radcliffe apprehended Francesca Findabair and Fercart and brought them to where the rest of the supporters were waiting before moving them to Garstang.
However, the plan soon fell apart and a battle erupted between the two sides in Garstang. Keira had been overpowered by them and Terranova proceeded to throw her out of a window but Geralt, who'd been on his way into the tower to find Yennefer, happened to be just below and she instead landed on the witcher. Suffering from a broken leg and ribs, Keira had Geralt carry her so she could show him the way in, meanwhile explaining all that had transpired right before the fight broke out. Keira managed to survive despite her wounds but, having been exiled by her king, took refuge in Montecalvo, Philippa's castle, along with Triss Merigold, Margarita Laux-Antille, and another unnamed mage, where they attempted to help Queen Hedwig regain control of Redania.
Joining the Lodge.
On August 5th, she joined Philippa's plans to create a new mage organization, the Lodge of Sorceresses, attending both the first and second meeting on the 19th of that month. However, like many of the other sorceresses in attendance, she wrongly believed Yennefer had sided with Nilfgaard during the coup and, along with Sabrina, made occasional scathing remarks towards the black-haired sorceress.
As January 1268 rolled around, another member of the Lodge, Fringilla Vigo, had seduced Geralt when his travels took him into Toussaint, hoping to keep him there until Spring. However, Geralt learned where Vilgefortz was and proceeded to make haste, but not before Fringilla got him to tell her the location and, in turn, informed the Lodge. Believing they had the upper hand, Keira and Sabrina were sent to ambush the hideout, Rhys-Rhun Castle, to get Ciri, but when they arrived they realized Geralt was smarter than they realized: he had given Fringilla a false location that'd been abandoned for years.
Hiding in Velen.
Despite no indication of her involvement in the assassinations of King Foltest of Temeria and King Demavend III of Aedirn, she was condemned to death along with the rest of the Lodge members. As such, she went into hiding near Midcopse in Velen, fearing the wrath of the witch hunters. Here, she hid under the guise of a witch and used her skills to help take care of the locals, who thus protected her and didn't turn her in to the witch hunters. At one point while here, she was approached by an elven mage seeking out a certain type of potion, promising her he'd give her a magical lamp once he finished using it. He then inquired about trying to find an "ashen-haired woman", as they were supposed to meet in Velen. Keira had no knowledge of the woman's whereabouts so he let her know if she did learn anything, he was hiding in some elven ruins in the area before leaving.
Sometime later, Geralt came by and she spotted him in the small group of villagers outside her hut. She then retreated inside to a secret, magically-generated chamber where she proceeded to take a bath knowing Geralt would soon find her. Sure enough, Geralt found his way into the secret location and after coyly showing off her nude form to him, Geralt revealed the reason he sought her out: he heard Ciri had been in the area and quarreled with a witch. While Keira hadn't seen Ciri, she did note about the mysterious elf's earlier visit and the elven ruins. As Keira hadn't yet received the lamp, she decided to go along with Geralt to explore the ruins.
When the two arrived, they ran into members of the Wild Hunt and after navigating through various tunnels and puzzles, faced off against several portals that had been opened to the White Frost. After the two worked to close them off, Nithral blocked their way and Keira helped Geralt fight against the Wild Hunt's member. With Nithral defeated, they explored the final part of the hideout, where it was clear the elf had escaped with the assistance of Keira's potion, but there were no signs of Ciri. However, still needing that lamp, Keira asked for Geralt's assistance in finding it, as it was bound to have been hidden and still in the hideout somewhere.
"If Geralt helps Keira find the lamp:" With Geralt's help, the two found the magical lamp. While she didn't fill in Geralt on the full details of why she needed it, she did note she'd need his help later with it.
Appearance and personality.
Keira was short and slim with long, straight, straw-colored hair. She had a small mole above her left breast, and wore expensive clothing, such as a green tulle top and horned agama skin slippers to the Thanedd ball. Around her neck she wore an ankh cross; silver and set with zircon. Fond of luxury, she despised the dirtiness of the outdoors, and was rather eccentric in nature.
"Geralt first met Keira Metz when she literally dropped on top of him out of nowhere. During the infamous coup on Thanedd Island, Keira was defenestrated and nearly landed right on the witcher's head. The next time Geralt saw her, in the swamps of Velen, was shocking in a different way - the luxury-loving sorceress was the last person he expected to see in such a grim and barren place."
"Geralt later learned the reason for this, and Keira's fate gave him ample fodder for contemplating the cruel whimsies of the wheel of fortune. Once the esteemed advisor to the now late King Foltest, she had been chased out of Temeria when she lost that ruler's trust. Later she joined the Lodge of Sorceresses, which earned her the hatred of Redania's king and Nilfgaard's emperor alike. Because of this, she had gone deep undercover, posing as a cunning woman, a village witch of sorts, deep in the Velen boondocks. It was not at all difficult to tell that she despised every minute of this."
"Keira then asked Geralt for another favor: lifting the curse from the tower of Fyke Isle. Curses and favors being what Geralt does best, he obliged."
"Keira had never stopped longing for the luster of life at a royal court. Thatch-roofed huts could hardly compare to elegant ballrooms and palace gardens. One day she decided to organize an interlude from Velen's grim atmosphere by treating herself to a sumptuous meal."
If Geralt does not sleep with Keira:
"Acquiring the refined ingredients proved less trouble than finding an appropriate dinner partner - that is, until Geralt showed up. The witcher gladly accepted the sorceress' invitation for dinner - but showing unusual restraint, turned down her other, decidedly unambiguous propositions."
If Geralt does sleep with Keira:
"Acquiring the refined ingredients proved less trouble than finding an appropriate dinner partner - that is, until Geralt showed up. The witcher gladly accepted the sorceress' invitation - and continued saying yes all evening."
"Sadly, an evening that started out so nicely ended quite unfortunately for the witcher. Keira put him to sleep with a secretly-cast spell. Clearly, she wanted to hide something from him..."
"It turned out that Keira had played the witcher like a well-tuned harp, strumming all the right chords to keep him occupied while she stole the mage Alexander's notes from Fyke Isle. She was planning to use the notes as a bargaining chip while making a deal with Radovid. His plague research could be her ticket back to life without lice, ticks and omnipresent filth."
If Geralt refuses to let Keira go to Radovid:
"Keira was determined to get her way, but Geralt could not allow her to carry out her plans. Both refused to budge, leading to a fight in which Keira Metz lost her life."
If Geralt convinces Keira to go to Kaer Morhen:
"In the end Geralt succeeded in squelching Keira's mad plan to bargain with a man whose favorite negotiating tools were red-hot pincers and burning pyres. Keira changed her destination from Oxenfurt to the decidedly safer confines of Kaer Morhen."
"During the battle for Kaer Morhen Keira fought bravely against Eredin's minions and saved Lambert from certain death."
"Later it turned out that fighting side by side had forged a bond between Keira and Lambert and they decided to continue developing it after the battle was over. This confirmed my theory that witchers and sorceresses clearly share some mystical mutual attraction."
If Geralt let Keira go parley with Radovid:
"Though her planned move was as stupid as it was risky, Keira was deaf to all Geralt's arguments. In the end he had to admit he had no right to stop her, and so Keira left, taking Alexander's notes with her."

Assire var Anahid was a mage in the Nilfgaardian Empire's service who hailed originally from Vicovaro. She was a sister of Eviva, aunt of Mawr and Cinead var Anahid, as well as grand-aunt to Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach.
Assire was a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses and remained a member along with Fringilla Vigo, also in service of the Empire. She was also known for helping Imperator Emhyr var Emreis with military operations during the Second Northern War. Even though Assire was a Nilfgaardian sorceress, she and Eviva had Nordling blood. She also owned a black cat called Merlin.
Biography.
Foundation of the Lodge.
In August 1267, Assire was contacted by Philippa Eilhart to join the creation of a new mage organization. At the risk of her own life, as doing such a thing was forbidden for Nilfgaardian mages, she attended the first meeting via teleprojection. On first seeing her, the northern sorceresses were surprised by her unattractive appearance, since northern mages often used glamours while in Nilfgaard it was frowned upon, believing attractiveness was proof of a sorceress' superficial mindset. Assire, along with the other sorceresses, listened to Philippa's proposal to create the Lodge and at the end was asked to invite a second Nilfgaardian sorceress to the next meeting in a couple weeks.
Thus she met with fellow countrywoman and sorceress, Fringilla Vigo. Fringilla was surprised that Assire had changed her style, choosing to wear more fashionable attire, as they prepared to leave to meet with the other sorceresses. It was during the meeting with the Lodge, when they discussed Ciri, that Assire revealed that Emhyr did not have Ciri but an impostor. Assire took advantage of Carthia van Canten's relationship with the head of Nilfgaardian Secret Service, Vattier de Rideaux, and used it to spy on him, reporting any vital information to the Lodge.
Death in Loc Muinne and legacy.
In 1271, she teleported from Nilfgaard to Loc Muinne and met with ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. He presented her Triss Merigold who was under the spell of artefact compression. Assire decompressed Triss and then was immediately restrained and killed by Shilard and Renuald aep Matsen due to her affiliation with the Lodge.
Because of the hazy circumstance surrounding her death, many speculations rose in the Empire, fueling propaganda and political conflicts for several years.
At one point in Nilfgaard's history, images of sorceresses were destroyed very diligently and thoroughly leaving no relevant source of their appearance for future. In the 14th century, however, all of the Lodge's members were posthumously rehabilitated and given sainthood and martyrdom.
Appearance and personality.
Assire was considered unattractive and "seedy", bearing a pale face with poor complexion, expressionless eyes, thin bluish lips and a somewhat crooked nose; her hair dark and not very fresh-looking. Before joining the Lodge, she wore a strange, conical and slightly crumpled hat, complemented by her shapeless, black, baggy robes, embroidered on the shoulders with a frayed silver thread. The embroidery depicted a half-moon within a circle of stars, the only decoration she wore. She was slim, and her hands marked by yellow spots, her fingernails broken and uneven, due to being bitten. She, however, had a pleasant and melodious voice.
"This sorceress came from Nilfgaard, or more precisely from Vicovaro - a distinction of extreme importance to the highborn of the Empire, as I can attest from personal experience. That is because the term "Nilfgaardian" is reserved for native residents of the Empire's capital and its immediate vicinity. Assire var Anahid was nothing like stereotypical Nilfgaardian sorceresses – unkempt things in unfashionable attire. On the contrary, she wore well-cut dresses and underlined her beauty with just the right touch of makeup, following the example of our sorceresses in the North."
"As momentous events played out in Loc Muinne, Assire was murdered - probably by her own countrymen, possibly on order of the emperor himself. The hazy circumstances surrounding her death gave rise to much speculation in Nilfgaard, fueling propaganda and political conflicts for some time to come."

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Fringilla Vigo was a Nilfgaardian sorceress and a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses along with her fellow countrywoman, Assire var Anahid. She was also the second cousin of Anna Henrietta of Toussaint. She was a woman with natural grace, green eyes and close-cropped black hair. During the First Northern War Fringilla fought for Nilfgaard at the Battle of Sodden Hill where she blinded Yennefer who was fighting on the opposing side.
When Geralt and his team reached Toussaint, Fringilla embarked on a romantic relationship with Geralt and did everything in her power to keep him from leaving the castle. While the witcher did develop some feelings for her, he never quite was able to put Yennefer out of his mind, even going so far as to use Yennefer's name instead of Fringilla's in the throes of passion.
Biography.
In Nilfgaard, Fringilla was approached by Assire var Anahid who offered her the chance to become a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. While initially surprised by Assire's appearance, since Assire never really put effort into her appearance before, Assire pointed out that Fringilla had always been one to put effort into her own looks, noting that among Nilfgaardian mages Fringilla didn't care about their stereotypes (as Nilfgaard believed mages that focused on their looks were superficial). The two southern sorceresses then discussed events at Nilfgaard's court before preparing to meet the Lodge.
The two teleported to Montecalvo, where they met the other members of the Lodge. However, when a reluctant Yennefer appeared with Francesca and Ida, Yennefer immediately recognized Fringilla, as the two fought on opposite sides in the Battle of Sodden Hill. Using this to her advantage, Fringilla was able to talk to Yennefer alone during a break in the meeting and, knowing Yennefer was trying to escape to get to Ciri, gave her hints on how to get around Montecalvo's impenetrable barrier.
Imprisoned by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself, due to her treasonous connections with the Lodge, Fringilla was sought after by her former associates, along with Geralt, in their bid to defy and defeat the Wild Hunt near Undvik on Skellige Islands.
"Emperor Emhyr had once presented the mages of Nilfgaard with a simple choice: either serve their country unquestioningly or die in prison."
"Fringilla Vigo, a mistress of magic holding office in the vassal duchy of Toussaint, refused both options and instead joined the infamous Lodge of Sorceresses, whose aim was to stand up to the dictates of kings and emperors. These bold ambitions were never fulfilled, however, and Fringilla Vigo lived in fear that her ties to this subversive organization would be discovered and she would meet a quick end at the hands of the emperor's executioners."
"One must mention here that Geralt first met Fringilla at the ducal palace in Beauclair many years ago, when we were there enjoying the hospitality of my one-time love, Duchess Anna Henrietta. The witcher, always a sucker for sorceresses, conjoined with Madame Vigo during this time in a quite lively relationship that surely was no cause of joy for Triss or Yennefer."
"All indications were that Fringilla had been arrested and remained in a Nilfgaardian prison, undoubtedly awaiting execution for acts of high treason."
"She was later released, however, thanks to a bargain Yennefer had struck with Emhyr."

Ida Emean aep Sivney was an elven sorceress from the Blue Mountains and a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. She was also an "Aen Saevherne", who were considered to be powerful, but enigmatic, elven sages. 
Little is known of her origins or motives, but she appeared in Dol Blathanna as an associate and advisor of Francesca Findabair. It was on Francesca's insistence that Ida joined the Lodge of Sorceresses, presumably due to her valuable and extensive knowledge of "Hen Ichaer", the Elder Blood, and the power associated with it.
She had cinnabar red hair, and wore elven makeup. She was dressed in an airy chiffon dress the color of daffodils. She didn't wear precious metals or stones, preferring instead pearls, coral, and amber. 
Biography.
In 1272, when Geralt and Yennefer discovered that the being, Uma, had some connection to finding Ciri, Yennefer contacted Ida using a megascope. After pronouncing the incantation of the curse, Ida starts to back away, but when pressed she reveals that it was a powerful curse in the forgotten language, One Speech. She gave the two advice on possible solutions to reversing the curse, then warning them that the Elder blood could initiate or stop the White Frost and that Geralt will be the one to influence the events. Later, when Triss tries to contact help from the Lodge to fight the Wild Hunt, Ida outright refused.

Witcher fighting styles

A witcher carries two swords - but only wields one at a time, so the other hand is free to cast signs. Generally speaking, the silver blade is more effective against anything supernatural (werewolves, genies, vampires, ghosts, etc.) and the steel blade is more useful against mutants, humanoids and ordinary beasts.
There are nominally three different fighting styles in "The Witcher"; for developmental purposes, however, there are effectively six, as Talent points must be applied separately for steel and silver applications.
Lambert can give Geralt a detailed description of each style during the Prologue; this conversation is the source of the quotes below.
Strong style.
Lambert refers to this as the "Temerian Devil".
"It was devised by Temerian landsknechts, simple men. It works best against heavy, armored opponents."
Hitting hard and heavy... of all the witcher fighting styles, this deals the most damage in a single blow to one opponent. The downside is its slowness; the enemy may be quick enough to slip in a debilitating blow of their own while the witcher is just preparing to strike. But against knights and necrophages, creatures with thick skin or tough armour, Strong Style cuts the fighting time to a much more bearable length. (Here is a list of strong opponents.) As dexterity improves, added attack efficiency renders Strong Style much more useful against swift opponents (see Fast style).
Mechanics.
Use the Strong Style to defeat larger, armoured opponents:
Fast style.
 Lambert calls the Fast Style "Addan Aenye", the Fiery Dancer.
"The elven swordsman and poet Nissail created it from his observations of wild cats, especially ocelots. The style favours speed and agility over strength of blows. The Fiery Dancer affords the opponent no time to strike. As Nissail wrote, 'The ideal Swordsman is a flame that can not be hurt and inflicts wounds each time it is touched.' This style holds sway among the elven aristocracy."
This style is a must when facing quick and agile opponents, like ghosts and vampires. However, it is relatively useful against heavier opponents like necrophages, too, because the blows landing in quick succession leave them precious little time to retaliate. This also means that the fights may become drawn out, the witcher 'bleeding' his opponent with nicks and shallow cuts. (Here is a list of fast opponents.)
Mechanics.
Use the Fast Style to defeat agile opponents:
Group style.
Lambert names this the "Viroledan Naev'de Feaine Glaeddyv".
"Literally translated, it is the "Nine Sun Swords". The swordsmen of Viroledo developed it as a method for tackling several opponents through complex slashing techniques. Masters of this style fight nine opponents simultaneously."
When surrounded by a multitude of creatures, this style shines. Its beautiful, circular moves make sure that every single one of the surrounding opponents gets hit (and with upgrades, grants a considerable chance of knocking them down). The Viroledan should be used with consideration; even though certain foes (like drowners) fall under the dancing blade like leaves, there are also monsters in the midst of which the Group Style is not recommended (such as exploding bloedzuigers and cemetaurs). When facing mixed groups, it is best to target the weakest enemy, where the chances of missing are the smallest. (Here is a discussion about group opponents.)
Mechanics.
The Group Style is most effective against multiple weaker opponents:

Famous fist fighter's tooth

Famous fist fighter's tooth is a quest item in "The Witcher".
It is Geralt's "trophy" for beating Zdenek, the (until then) most famous fist-fighter in history and reigning champion, during the Fistfight quest.
Later, during Won't Hurt a Bit, you can sell the tooth to Zahin Schmartz for 250 , a step which is needed to achieve the sword G'valchir.

G'valchir is a Mahakaman rune sihill that is given to Geralt by the dentist as a reward for the Won't Hurt a Bit quest, or by the Royal huntsman as a possible reward (the other possible reward being the Moon Blade) for killing all ten trophy monsters in Chapter V. It is used primarily against humans and has little effect on .
It can also be obtained by completing the Mud and Velvet quest and keeping the money for yourself (if so, you have to kill Captain Jean-Pierre for it). It can also be found on the Fields in Chapter IV, however only in the original version (1.0) of the game.
Described by Zahin Schmartz as "slicing up humans nicely".
It is the highest damage steel sword in the game, the equivalent silver sword being the Moonblade.

Bifunctional fiber and alloy recirculator

Bifunctional fiber and alloy recirculator is a quest item in Chapter V which is required only if Geralt follows the Scoia'tael path and has Raven's Armor of the Elves made for him by Malcolm Stein, the dwarven blacksmith. The fabrication of this armor is not strictly necessary to the plot, however.
The recirculator is found in a dwarven trunk, in the ancient crypt beneath the old mine in the swamp cemetery along with some dwarven spirit.

Remains of Raven's Armor

Remains of Raven's armor appear to be a spaulder, a rerebrace, and a gauntlet: the three pieces said to still be intact of the fabled Raven's armor. Together, they make one of the quest items necessary for the completion of the Armor quest, irrespective of the path chosen by Geralt. The armor fragments can be found in Raven's sarcophagus, along with The Book of the Kiss, in his crypt, a cave in the eastern part of the swamp cemetery.
The inscription on the open sarcophagus lid is still legible. It reads:
"Here lies the witcher known as Raven — A great warrior and defender of the weak. Honored be his name."

Heliotrop

Heliotrop or Heliotrope is a magical sign used by witchers. It is made by crossing one's wrists, and works as a buffer against physical attacks, combat magic and impacts with walls, ground etc. Contrary to Quen, which is active until broken or dispelled, the Heliotrop is active only for a moment and cushions from a single powerful attack or damage.
Adaptations.
Heliotrop works as a shield against charms, spells, sounds and other energies directed towards it, but is useless against purely physical attacks.
Heliotrop sign is the ultimate skill (Sense of Magic) on the Magic tree of Geralt's skill set. To use it you must fill the adrenaline bar by using any of the other signs. Once the bar is fully charged, activate the sign, this will cause adrenaline to reset to zero. The Heliotrop sign creates a temporary immobile circular force-field area around Geralt, which considerably slows down everything inside the field except himself.
In the leaked materials for the third game, Heliotrop was mentioned, like under the cut content for Ifrit. However it was never implemented in game.

Creyden is a small northern principality, vassal to Kovir and Poviss, and member of the Hengfors League.
History.
Settlement.
Creyden was first settled by the Dauk and Wozgor people before the First Landing in the 760s, according to a classification by the historian Arnelius Grock.
It was conquered by the Earldom of Kovir prior to the 12th century, and was likely part of the East March.
13th century.
In the first decades of the 13th century the principality was ruled by Prince Fredefalk Vellga and his second wife, Aridea. Aridea possessed one of Nehalenia's Mirrors which she used to determine the fate of the realm. It informed her that she and a great number of other people would die a horrible death at the hands of Fredefalk's beloved firstborn daughter, Renfri, who was incidentally born under the curse of the Black Sun. With this, she informed the Council who sent Stregobor, a mage who firmly believed in the curse, who confirmed the duchess's suspicions, and the duchess hired a thug to kill her stepdaughter in the forest, but Renfri managed to kill the thug instead and escape. Over the course of the next four years, Aridea sent numerous assassins after the princess but none of them returned. Some time later she was found dead in the bed, reportedly poisoned by Fredefalk after he found a younger mistress.
At some point in the 1250s, King Niedamir conquered Creyden. This deed disturbed the newly crowned Esterad Thyssen of Kovir and Poviss because Creyden had been a Kovirian vassal for ages. After a short war the Fourth Treaty of Lan Exeter was signed, and while Creyden remained part of Hengfors League, it was granted to Esterad's young daughter Gaudemunda and was governed by Esterad himself until she reached maturity. Gaudemunda later married Prince Aristide Vermuellen and the Vermuellens were still in power in 1352 when Gaudemunda and Aristide's son, Guiscard, was 95 years old.
National emblems.
One of Creyden's national or ducal emblems consisted of emeralds and rubies and a lunar symbol below them. It was depicted on a broche worn by Princess Renfri.
"Emblems in the infobox have been created by wiki editors basing on official description and/or depictions."
Geography and climate.
Creyden is a seaside country that borders Kovir to the west and Hengfors, Malleore, and Sturefors to the east.
The majority of Creyden is situated on a limestone bedrock with only a shallow layer of soil, especially in the west. Its landscape consists mostly of vast, lush meadows spotted with rocky outcrops here and there.
Economy.
Due to the poor soil, the duchy is not economically strong, living mostly off sheep farms. It exports wool and imports oversea goods such as .

Fredefalk or Friedfalk Vellga was prince of Creyden and the father of Renfri. He married Aridea after the demise of his first wife Silvena, Renfri's mother.
Biography.
Not much is known about Fredefalk except with his first wife he had a daughter named Renfri, whom he adored. After his first wife presumably died, he started a relationship with Aridea, with whom he had a couple children out of wedlock before the two married. It's known they had at least one son while they were together. However, years later, Aridea was poisoned and subsequently died and rumors spread that Fredefalk himself killed her after finding a younger, more robust, mistress. He shortly died himself in a strange hunting accident.
"Scroll 1: Fredefalk recalled that day—the day when the night came at noon and Renfri was born. The sun was slowly fading, plunging Creyden into a blue twilight. Courtiers and villagers fearfully gazed at the sky, waiting for the moment when the gluttonous shadow would consume the remnants of light. Princess Silvena was lying in her bed. The hunting clothes were stained with blood—this time her own. As soon as she mounted the horse, the pregnant woman suffered excruciating pain. Dark streams trickled down from between her thighs and did not stop flowing as the unconscious princess was carried into the chamber. The unfortunate one Silvena had chosen as her chosen prey, which she intended to personally shoot with a crossbow, was very lucky. More than the maid who dared to look the princess in the face. More than the stable boy who missed a splash of mud while cleaning the Princess's saddle after the last hunt."
"Scroll 2: Ever since Fredefalk had learned that Silvena was with child, he had wondered what their child would inherit from her mother. The fact that she could be like him had not even crossed his mind. The prince was sure that a girl would be born. She will have eyes the color of seawater and will look at him the same way as Silvena—as if challenging him to a duel in which he had no chance to win. Fredefalk shifted his gaze from the pale face of his unconscious wife to the window. The thin silver ring of the sun seemed to crack under the onslaught of darkness. The silence was broken by a scream. Silvena opened her eyes and began giving birth."
"Scroll 3: The girl, Renfri, turned out to be healthy and strong. She was, after all, her mother's daughter. Silvena's breathing was shallow but steady. She was asleep. The sweat clumped the Princess's long light hair into wet pods. Fredefalk looked inquiringly at the midwife, standing in a bloody apron on the other side of the bed. The woman nodded. Fredefalk wasn't surprised. He had never doubted that of the two of them he would be the first to die, not his wife. The prince leaned over the cradle and looked at the shriveled, reddened face. He expected the newborn to have closed eyes, but it seemed to him that something flashed between the sparse lashes. A quick, evil glance. Or maybe a drop of moisture? The prince stretched out his hand and carefully touched the light down on the baby's head. He thought about it. After a long moment, he motioned for the midwife. He whispered in her ear, and she listened silently. When he was leaving, he stopped at the door. The woman stood still with a silk pillow she held just above Silvena's face. One word was enough. The midwife was waiting."
"Scroll 4: Aridea, Fredefalk's second wife, was in many ways similar to Silvena—maybe that was why the prince noticed her. What, in turn, differed her from Fredefalk's first wife, was her lack of panache and imagination. Aridea's exploits never become as famous as Silvena's hunts—overshadowed by stories of Renfri's exploits. First, there was the puppy that her stepmother had given her and which, in unexplained circumstances, fell out of the tower window. Then a maid, mutilated with tailor's scissors, who herself swore it was an accident. Gradually, whispers began to spread among the courtiers about the Curse of the Black Sun, affecting girls born soon after the eclipse. Fredefalk did not give credence to the superstitions, but he did not silence the rumors. From her narrow, pale face, Silvena's eyes looked at him searchingly, as if Renfri was judging whether she was strong enough to beat him.He did not remember what he considered to be the final proof. Suddenly he felt he couldn't wait any longer. All it took was one word to finally be free of them both—mother and daughter. One word whispered into the ear of the right person. Aridea tilted her head, her pupils dilating as she listened to her husband's whisper."
"Chest: The dollhouse is in disarray. Little princesses in little tiaras made of real diamonds lie in a row, stripped of their dresses. Their porcelain faces remain perfectly indifferent as if they have become accustomed to similar humiliations. Fredefalk straightens up and walks to the open window in Renfri's chamber. The prince looks at the garden. He sees Aridea handing a heavy bag to a man dressed in hunting clothes. Renfri runs out of the palace. The hunter takes her by the hand and together they walk towards the forest. On the man's back sways a crossbow, while in the princess' chamber sways a golden cage. The canary's home nudges Fredefalk on the shoulder. On the sawdust-covered bottom lies the tiny body of a dead bird dressed in a dress. The prince returns to his memories."

This version is a junk item and was likely intended to be more common, but after large portions of cut content, only one known source of these remains - the Temerian Guerillas who help in Radovid's assassination during Reason of State. Some of them will inevitably die and squirrel tails can appear as random loot on their remains. Theoretically, other corpses classified as Temerian should be able to have the item as random loot, but it is unknown if such are even placed anywhere.
Squirrel tails should also be sold by a quartermaster at the Temerian Partisan Hideout, who however doesn't appear during gameplay due to a bug.

Tretogor (Common Slavic: "Three Mountains") is the capital of Redania since King Vestibor and the location of the royal court. It is located less than 300 miles from Oxenfurt, near copper deposits.
Ironically, although Redania is a powerful kingdom, the capital itself is relatively small. Besides the stately Royal Palace and Government Building, Tretogor is not particularly impressive. Most of the people living here work for the government and the trading centre is rather modest due to the proximity of Novigrad. Not all is dull here though – the city is known for its annual horse racing event known as the Grand Tretorian, as well as lively inns and nearby town/district of Coppertown, where the famous dwarven miners' brass orchestra performs.
History.
First Landing.
Tretogor once was the location of an ancient Aen Seidhe settlement, which, upon the great eastern expansion of humans approximately five hundred years ago, was abandoned by the elves and in its place humans built this city.
Second Northern War.
In June 1267, after corruption was discovered within the kingdom, a Redanian baron who had secretly allied himself with Nilfgaard was executed in the capital. On the 30th, on the night of the Thanedd coup, King Vizimir II was assassinated in the capital by an elven assassin. Queen Hedwig became regent of the kingdom, quickly aided by the arrival of Philippa Eilhart, Triss Merigold, Keira Metz, Margarita Laux-Antille, and a number of other mages displaced by the coup and the northern rulers newly found indisposition to their kind.

Fenne was a merchant's daughter who likely hailed from the Murivel region. She was one of the women Nivellen shared his home with for a year and the first with whom he slept with after both of them had gotten drunk.
She came up with the idea of scaring away unwanted visitors by riding on galloping Nivellen's back, completely naked and blowing the hunting horn of Nivellen's grandfather.

Refugees' caves

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The fighting between the Order and the Scoia'tael in the streets of Old Vizima has taken its toll and former residents are now refugees, seeking shelter anywhere. Their daily battles in the streets have driven many Vizimans into the swamp cemetery. At least there they need only fear the drowned dead, drowners and bloedzuigers.
Scattered about the swamp are a number of caves. Some caves lead to ancient and abandoned crypts, others to long forgotten industrial concerns. Three of the caves have now become known as Refugee caves, for obvious reasons:
Druids' cave.
The Druids' cave tends to be the first cave Geralt finds in the swamp cemetery. Just west and north of Cemetery Island, it is where he must lead either Shani or Zoltan Chivay, depending on the path he has chosen. It is also where cousin Corbin is hiding along with some Druids preparing for The Green March.
 Sewants can be found here.
Eastern cave.
The second (for lack of a better designation) cave entrance can be found near the entrance to the cemetery, just east of Cemetery Island. Basically, there is nothing there except one of Antoinette's cousins, Buse. There may be some loot in a barrel, but otherwise, this cave is a big disappointment.
 Sewants can be found here.
Southern cave.
This is the most southerly of the three refugee caves, and so tends to be the last of the Refugee caves that Geralt finds. It is south and to the ever-so-slightly west of Cemetery Island and has two chambers. One is where Zdenek, the most famous fist fighter in history resides. Hidden in the recesses of this chamber lies one of the Ancient crypts: Agnes of Glanville's lair. The other chamber is where Ramerot and another refugee are holed up.
 Sewants can be found here.

 &lt;/group&gt;

Roach (Polish: "Płotka") is the name that Geralt of Rivia, the witcher, gives to all of his horses. His preference is for mares.
Name.
The name refers to the , a common European fresh water fish. It has nothing to do with the cockroach, and nothing directly to do with the either the French given name "Roche" or the character Vernon Roche. Though the English term for the fish ("roach") does in fact share its origin with "Roche": both terms come from the French word for "rock".
It's worth noting that the original name for the horse in Polish is "Płotka", a diminutive form of the word "Płoć" (meaning "roach"). Diminutives are endearing in Polish, so a more direct translation would have been something along the lines of "Roachy" or "Roachie".
Moreover, the Polish word is female gendered which corresponds with Geralt's preference for mares - it would be odd for a stallion to be called "Płotka". The tender tone as well as the gender of the name is lost in the translation.
However, "Płotka" has another meaning which is "small fry". In the Polish version of the third game, this is brought up during Broken Flowers if Geralt beats Morvran Voorhis in a race, who will praise him by saying ""Impressive rider skills from someone for whom every horse is a small fry." "In this meaning the name becomes gender neutral, thus can be used for a stallion as well.
The horse Geralt owned throughout the game is named Roach. There is a number of equipment available for Roach: saddles, saddlebags, and horse blinders. Saddles let Roach gallop full speed longer, saddlebags increases Geralt's inventory limit, and the blinders decreases the rate that Roach's fear level rises.
In a contrast to the previous games, trophies gained from contracted monsters appear tied to Roach's saddle instead of on Geralt's person. If Geralt visits Emhyr after he finds Ciri, and does not accept the coin offered, when he leaves he is granted a black Pure Bred Nilfgaardian thoroughbred stallion. After this event, whenever Roach is called, a black horse appears instead of the original bay mare.
 "A horse is more to a witcher than merely a means of locomotion - just ask any bandit who has taken a well-aimed hoof to the head during combat. Additionally, many a witcher has talked over the nuts and bolts of his current contract with his horse while staring at the stars shining above the lonely road, though few would ever admit to this."
 "Geralt named his every mount Roach, though no one really knows why or what Geralt had in mind with this name. When asked, Geralt would dodge the question or give an evasive answer. Perhaps this had just been the first word that came to his head? Roach, for her part, seemed to accept the name with no reservations."
 "Geralt would grow annoyed and curse whenever Roach panicked and tossed him in the middle of a battle, as well as when she would suddenly turn a different direction that he wanted while he was riding at full gallop towards some urgent destination. In truth, though, he was very attached to her and would never trade her for any other horse. Not even one which, when summoned, would never stand helpless in front of a seemingly easily surmountable obstacle, such as a low fence or stray piece of timber. Nor even one which would sometimes, in some incomprehensible fashion, wind up dancing on some peasant's roof. "Well," Geralt would say with a shrug. "A witcher's horse isn't a normal animal. Constant contact with magic beverages and Signs must have left a mark.""
 "While completing a contract in Toussaint, Geralt had the chance to find out exactly how serious Roach took her role and how well-versed in the arcana of the witcher's trade she was. He also discovered she was an entirely pleasant conversation partner."

Nazair is a land located south of the Amell Mountains, adjacent to the Great Sea. It used to be an independent kingdom with political and dynastical ties with the Northern Realms, these ties were however severed by the Nilfgaardian occupation and desolation of the capital city of Assengard.
History.
Early history.
Before the Nilfgaardian invasion, the royal power was concentrated mostly along the rivers and coastline, while the rocky, hilly interior was inhabited by independent clans of highlanders competing each other for resources. This brigand interior was mostly avoided by merchant trails, while the nobility participated in cultural contacts with the North. The royalty occasionally intermarried with Nordling dynasties, like in case of Princess Becca, wife of king Cerbin of Cintra. Dukes from Nazair controlled even parts of modern-day Toussaint. The most famous of them was probably Adam of Nazair, who - in attempt to irrigate the Nazairian part of his realm - unwillingly created the famed Sansretour Marsh.
Nazair's relation with Cintra was severed by King Corbett of the latter. At least one war took place in the heart of Nazair, when Assengard was sacked by people from as far north as Redania; one of them was Nivellen's grandfather who took a bathtub and blue rose seedlings from the city. Another war took place in 1233 when Nazair invaded Cintra for loot, but was defeated by Queen Calanthe's troops at the Battle of Hochebuz.
Nilfgaardian province.
The conquest of Nazair by the Nilfgaardian Empire, though cruel, was described as unusually difficult. The capital city of Assengard was desolated, but many of the interior highlander clans avoided subjugation and still cause troubles for imperial forces.
In 1260s Nazairian nobles and highlanders rebelled against the Empire. Emperor Emhyr var Emreis tasked Major General Markus Braibant to handle the situation. Braibant's forces, including an unit commanded by Dacre Silifant and Ola Harsheim, did indeed calm the rebellion - in a massacre.
During the Second and Third Northern War, the Empire formed its own units out of the Nazairian, consisting of arbalestiers and a large cavalry brigade. Emperor Jan Calveit bore the moniker "Nazairi Avenger".
National emblems.
Before the conquest, Nazair's coat of arms was a blue rose against a gold background. This design was also a part of the modern (post-conquest) coat of arms. Royal family members sometimes used a crest depicting a silver ship on the sea. There was also another symbol sometimes used in national heraldry, that of two axes with their blades facing away from each other.
Emblems in the infobox are speculated to be used during the Nilfgaardian period and are based on the official ones.

&lt;/tabber&gt;
Geography and climate.
Nazair is situated just south of the Amell, reachable from Cintra and Slopes through the Marnadal Stairs. The country is bordered by Metinna in the south and Mag Turga in the east.
Most of the fertile land is along the Great Sea coastline. The interior is said to be rocky and barren, with the exception of Lake Muredach and the Yelena valley.
Society and culture.
Throughout most of their history, the Nazairians were split between the nobility and royalty, residing at the coastline and along the rivers, and the highlander brigand clans independent from the royal power. The nobles had their beautiful summer houses in the interior as well, especially near Lake Muredach, however most of them were built to be defensible. The Nazairi cuisine is described to consist of "fancy meals".
After the rebellion, the Nazairians were forbidden to carry swords. Because of it, they are often equipped with elven messer, which are technically not swords but huge knives.
Economy.
The country is famous for its silver and cinnabarite mines. Local artisants specialize in the production of refined silver vases and skillfully detailed ceramics. The cinnabarite is used to dye inks.
Nazair is particularly known for its cultivation of azure roses found only in this region, with faint purple shades at the tips of the petals. Cuttings are in great demand and are often smuggled out of Nazair to be sold for outrageous prices.

Black Sun

Black Sun is a reference to a solar eclipse, better known in the context of the Curse of the Black Sun, or the Mania of Mad Eltibald.
It was prophesied by the mage Eltibald that an eclipse foretold the end of the human civilization in the hands of sixty girls born during the Black Sun, which would turn them into cruel creatures who would bring about the return of the goddess Lilit and the end of the world.
 ...[the girls] were supposed to have been possessed by demons, cursed, contaminated by the Black Sun, because that's what, in your pompous jargon, you called the most ordinary eclipse in the world.
Eltibald wasn't mad at all. He deciphered the writing on Dauk menhirs, on tombstones in the Wozgor necropolises, and examined the legends and traditions of weretots. All of them spoke of the eclipse in no uncertain terms. The Black Sun was to announce the imminent return of Lilit, still honoured in the east under the name of Niya, and the extermination of the human race. Lilit's path was to be prepared by "sixty women wearing gold crowns, who would fill the river valleys with blood". pg. 83, "The Last Wish" (U.K. edition)
History.
Following Etibald's prophecies, wizards such as Stregobor hunted down the girls, killed them, and performed autopsies when possible. After a while, when they admitted that recognizing the girls was hard, they opted to simply lock them up into towers, isolating them. That plan suffered, because there was a brief fancy of saving beautiful girls from towers among princes. One after the other, though, the girls either perished or managed to flee their towers, and grew mighty enough for the wizards to leave them alone or get them in other ways.
It might be that the Curse became a self-fulfilling prophecy, for some of the girls who managed to flee the persecution later inflicted cruelty on others because of the treatment they had suffered.
"The Price of Neutrality" premium module.
In this premium module for "The Witcher", Deidre is Eskel's surprise child, born under the Black Sun and prophesied to ruin the world and the sister of the nobleman who wants to make sure she will not have the crown. Sabrina wants to kill her as well to examine her body and discover the truth about the Black Sun - being The Witcher, Geralt has to choose with whom he sides.
"Eltibald's prophecy had wide repercussions –- to this day the debate rages as to whether it proved true or the ravings of a madman. In all certainty, there occurred a solar eclipse after which many mutated girls were born. Some of them were isolated from society immediately, from whence the tales of princesses imprisoned in towers atop glass mountains and princes who set out to rescue them."
"Rumors abound regarding bloody female outcasts born under the black sun and resembling women only in appearance. Many say the creatures proved nothing more than cruel monsters. Mages agreed to explore the matter and proceeded to employ various means in the investigations. Vivisections proved necessary in some cases, proving the only certain way of revealing the evil mutations. However, they could not agree on whether the internal anatomical deformations they discovered were decisive of the creatures' evil nature."
"The Curse of the Black Sun was prophesied by the mage Eltibald, who predicted the return of Lilith, a mythical being who is to bring ruin upon the world. Lilith's second coming will be preceded by the appearance of "sixty maidens wearing gold crowns, who will fill the river valleys with blood," thus preparing the way."

Libushe ("Polish": Libusze), or Libushka, was the wife of Caldemeyn (the alderman of Blaviken), and the mother of Marilka.
While her husband thoroughly enjoyed Geralt's company, Libushe didn't particularly like the witcher, believing he brought nothing but trouble. She also didn't like it very much when, on a past visit, Geralt tried to show off his witcher abilities by throwing a fork and killing a rat with it in complete darkness.

Eltibald was a mage known for his investigations into the Curse of the Black Sun.
Biography.
Eltibald investigated menhirs erected by the Dauk and tombstones in Wozgor necropolises, and familiarized himself with the bobolaks' mythology, and came to the conclusion that a certain solar eclipse, known as the Black Sun, would transform sixty of the girls born under it into cruel creatures who, ultimately, would bring about the return of the goddess Lilit and the end of the world.
Because of this idea, girls born of this curse, of all social classes, from peasants to royals, were hunted down by certain mages. Some were killed and others were locked away in high towers, while others were subjected to autopsy, and at least one to vivisection.

 * Heavy weapons
 * Short weapons&lt;br&gt;
Witcher's silver sword.
Given to Geralt at the beginning of Chapter II to fight The Beast of the Sewers. A silver sword is one of the two main tools of the witcher. It is a delicate blade only used against creatures who are vulnerable to silver, such as the undead and most types of monsters. It is light enough to be wielded in only one hand, leaving the other hand free for another weapon or for the casting of Signs.
The witcher's silver blade actually has a steel core which is plated with a thick layer of silver which is lethal to magical beasts. This weapon was made specifically for slaying monsters born of magic, those which can not be hurt with common steel weapons.

Eylembert, also known as Coodcoodak, was the thin and whiskered baron of Tigg and famous for his ability to mimic animal sounds.
Biography.
In 1252, Eylembert showed up at Pavetta's 15th birthday, hoping to vie for the princess' hand but Queen Calanthe noted he was already married. He then lamented that his wife was rather weak and, with smallpox rampant in the area, she'd likely be dead within a year. However, he appeared to be dissatisfied with his marriage in general as rumors about him and his wife included her chasing him for almost a mile with a pitchfork after finding him with another woman, but she was unable to catch him. Calanthe then gave him some advice to be more attentive to his wife, though this fell on deaf ears.
During the feast, Eylembert imitated various animal noises so realistically that, at one point, some of the servants thought some chickens had somehow gotten passed them and into the hall and later, riled up the dogs in the area by making the sound of a she-wolf howling. After Urcheon disrupted the feast, claiming Pavetta was his from the Law of Surprise after rescuing the late king 15 years ago, Eylembert showed he was very knowledgeable regarding children marked by destiny, mentioning those such as Zatret Voruta, Supree, and Zivelena's child, using the latter as an example of why he feels one should never try to deny destiny. When Calanthe showed disregard to these comments, Eylembart then asked the queen what should the people do if they can no longer take their ruler's word for anything as she was trying to deny giving Pavetta to Urcheon, despite her late husband's sworn oath.
After Pavetta stated she wanted to go with Urcheon, a fight broke out and Eylembert kicked a stool that, while it didn't trip Rainfarn of Attre as he ran to attack Urcheon, it caused enough of a delay to let Urcheon knock Rainfarn down. Eylembert then tried to disarm the knight but Rainfarn's charge, Prince Windhalm, wrapped himself around Eylembert's legs, preventing him from doing so. With all the chaos breaking out, the Force surrounding Pavetta erupted, sending furniture and suitors flying. After Geralt and Mousesack's first unsuccessful attempt to stun Pavetta, Eylembert got a hold of Draig Bon-Dhu's bagpipes and used it, along with his talent for making a cacophony of noises, to distract the princess long enough for the witcher and druid to break through the Force, bringing Pavetta back to her senses.

Zivelina was a queen of Metinna. She made a deal with the gnome Rumplestelt: her firstborn in exchange for getting the crown. When the gnome came for his reward, though, Zivelina refused and drove him off with magic. After a while, both the queen and her firstborn died of the plague.
Zivelina's story is counted among the examples of the Law of Surprise, of the consequences of trying to deny Destiny.

Telecommunicator

Telecommunication is a form of mind magic utilised by mages thoughout the world as a means of contact face-to-face while being apart. This can be via physical objects, such as a magical mirror, megascope, xenogloss (one-way only), or by casting complicated teleprojective spells that become tougher to maintain depending on ability and range.
"The Witcher".
There are three telecommunicators depicted over the course of "The Witcher". Triss Merigold mentions that they can only be used to communicate over short distances.
Triss' mirror.
Triss' mirror is found in Chapter III, in the bedroom of her home in the Trade Quarter. As Geralt regains consciousness in the opening scene, Triss can be seen using her mirror to speak with another sorceress, most likely it was Keira Metz. This mirror is also a teleporter.
Hartmann's mirror.
Hartmann's mirror is found at the Salamandra hideout in the restricted area of the Trade Quarter. The mirror is featured in a cut scene as part of the Lock and Key quest. It is only seen during one part of Chapter III and Geralt uses it on that one occasion to speak with Radovid (unless he forgets to do so...).
Javed's mirror.
Geralt finds one last telecommunicator, Javed's mirror in the mage's laboratory in the catacombs of the old manor in Chapter V. It is through the discovery of this telecommunicator that Geralt learns who is truly behind the Salamandra organization.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
After the slaughter of the seven gnomes, Renfri Vellga, better known as Shrike by then, gathered a new band of cutthroats. When they reached Blaviken, they had a letter of safe conduct from King Audoen.
The band was dismembered (quite literally) after they stood in Geralt of Rivia's way in the town as they meant to take the market goers hostage if the mage Stregobor didn't come out of his tower to face Renfri.

Tridam

Tridam is a fortified town and a barony somewhere on the Buina, not far from Malleore.
History.
In early 13th century, the baron of Tridam mercilessly treated the poachers hunting in his forest. Milaen was one of the few who managed to sneak out of the baron's ambushes.
The town was made famous by the Tridam ultimatum. The scenario entailed some brigands taking a boat full of innocent pilgrims and killing them one by one until the baron gave in to their demands. The baron was left in an unwinnable situation. He did capitulate and give in to the brigands saving further bloodshed, but many citizens blamed him for the deaths that did occur and postulated that storming the ship would have saved more lives.
The old baron was eventually murdered. Soldiers loyal to him left the city with Falibor and Torina and became renegades wanted by the law. They teamed up with Milaen, their former enemy, to sneak through, but most of them apparently perished or left before reaching Malleore.

Tridam ultimatum

"This is my story, not yours. You must let me finish telling it." — This article/section is a . You can help by [ expanding it].
The Tridam ultimatum is a strategy in which a number of people are held hostage, and either the demands of the aggressor are consented to, or the people will be killed one after the other.
It gets its name from the town of Tridam, where a local baron had thrown some brigands into a dungeon. The bandits' friends (among them the half-elf Civril) held a ferry full of pilgrims as hostages, demanding their friends' freedom in exchange for the people's lives.
The baron refused, and the bandits began throwing the pilgrims overboard. Dozen were killed in this manner before the baron changed his mind and freed the brigands.
Not everyone agreed with his choice; solutions to the situation that would not have allowed the bandits to go free were offered, along with suggestion for the baron to be exiled or executed.
The baron argued that he chose the lesser evil by letting the men go free, and thus saving the lives of over twenty-five people.
This happened on the Feast of Nis, about three years before the short story "The Lesser Evil", in which Renfri and her band (including aforementioned Civril) attempted to do the same with the people in Blaviken market and the wizard Stregobor. What transpires that day leads Geralt of Rivia to be known as the Butcher of Blaviken.

Adalia known as "the Seer", was queen of Cintra and the daughter of Muriel and Count Robert of Garramone.
Biography.
She was friends with many sorceresses from Aretuza, among them the famous Tissaia de Vries. But Adalia herself did not want to be a sorceress - she chose a different career.
At the time, the queen of Temeria, Bienvenu La Louve, was married to prince consort Ragbard, duke of Ellander. That marriage was dissolved after a short time - a rumor circulated that Ragbard was more interested in men's games and totally failed to live up to the queen's expectations in the bedchamber. Many a libelous song was sung on the subject.
But suddenly the rumors died down when the duke started meeting with Adalia, the count of Garramone's daughter. Shortly thereafter the wedding took place and, half a year later, Ragbard was dead - gossip said he had overdosed on medication supporting sexual potency. The widow Adalia was promoted from countess to duchess and began to devote herself to political life.
Queen Bienvenu was afraid of Adalia's intrigues, so she quickly set up an arranged marriage between the duchess and Dagorad, the prince of Cintra. As the Kingdom of Cintra, then ruled by King Corbett, had broke down relations with Verden, Aedirn, Lyria, and Nazair, they needed the alliance and dynastic union with Temeria so they had no choice but to accept the queen's arrangement.
By such measures Adalia "the Seer" became at first princess, and later queen, of Cintra. And this is why the fateful incest came to fruition - Dagorad and Adalia were in fact related. Adalia's real grandfather, Amavet, and Dagorad's grandmother, Fiona, were twin siblings, making them both descendants of the elven sorceress Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal, a carrier of the enigmatic gene. In relation to her loved ones Adalia was rather kind and happy, and her wedlock with Dagorad was a happy one. The fruition of their relationship, Princess Calanthe, was loved and pampered.
Adalia showed off her magical skills quite a few times. It is unclear how much truth there was in her "raising a drawbridge with a twitch of her eyebrows", but it is certain that the "Seer-Queen" possessed some magic and prophetic skills. After the death of her second husband, Adalia rejected the proposals for regency and, after young Calanthe was married, she left the country and settled down in Thanedd Isle, in Tissaia de Vries' school. There, without becoming a full-fledged sorceress, she died of old age.
Before her death, Adalia came back to Cintra only once - when, her great-granddaughter, Ciri, was born. Allegedly a long and heated conversation occurred between Adalia and Calanthe - but no one has learned the matter of this conversation.

A cosmic collision of several parallel universes, this disaster left numerous creatures not native to our reality trapped here. For example, ghouls and graveirs, which lack their own ecological niches are simply relics of the Conjunction."
 "The elves claim that humans also arrived in this world during the Conjunction. This occurred soon after they managed to destroy their own world. The elves claim that it was during the Conjunction that humans learned to use magic."
 "Of course, these are all vile lies and foul fabrications circulated by nonhumans, who will resort to the most malicious slander to justify their claims."
Journal entry.
A work devoted to the famous magical cataclysm. Describes the appearance of monsters, the origins of humans and human magic.

 "There are scores of learned works, dissertations and treatises about this magical cataclysm from about 1500 years ago. Because of this event, creatures never seen before entered our world, and still do not have their own ecological niche here. Among others, graveirs and ghouls are relics of the permeation of the spheres, though elven tradition has it that we, humans, are also newcomers from that time. The sorcerers claim that time humanity received both the wondrous gift and the terrible curse that they consider magic to be at that time."

The book can be found as random loot on almost any bookshelf throughout the third game, with at least one copy usually found in a chest by the entrance to Triss' ransacked house on Hierarch Square. It is also sold by Keira Metz and the halfling merchant in Silverton.
In the "Blood and Wine" expansion, it can also be found as random loot on bookshelves in houses around Toussaint, or purchased from the Ducal Camerlengo.
 "Scholars have many vices. Possibly the worst among them is a tendency to describe the simple in unnecessarily complex terms, to dress the plain the garb of false learning."The Conjunction of the Spheres" might serve an an excellent example of this. This name, so mysterious to a commoner's ear, could be replaced with a much simpler alternative: When the Worlds Collided. The phenomenon itself can also be explained in terms simple enough for a child to understand.Imagine, dear reader, that our world is a ship sailing on a great sea. From its deck we can see other, distant vessels - those are the stars. These vessels each bear their own goods and their own crews. They usually pass us at some distance, barely visible specks, even viewed through a spyglass. Once every few thousand years, however, a storm breaks above this cosmic sea, a storm so strong it tosses the ships towards one another, making them sail cheek by jowl. Part of the crew of one ship can, at such times, move to another, and some of the cargo from one ship's hold can spill onto a neighboring vessel. When the weather calms, the ships separate once again and sail their separate, invariably different ways.The so-called "post-Conjunction beings," namely monsters such as ghouls and basilisks, are precisely such passengers from another vessel. And we humans are castaways, flung against our will from somewhere far away onto a world previously inhabited by the Elder Races. Once here, we learned the arcane mysteries of magic. unbeknownst to us before.Could the worlds collide once more? Perhaps. Can this cataclysm be avoided, or thet oppposite - hastened? Some scholars believe there are beings who have mastered this skill, who possess rare genes allow which[] some to seize the helm of our vessel and steer us... to safer waters, or to our doom."

"-led by a fair-haired and painfully thin teenage girl." - "The Last Wish"
"She was older than he had initially thought - her delicate figure had deceived him, so different from the robust build of the other girls in the village." - "The Last Wish"
"Lille didn't lower her eyes. They were pale and wildly blue." - "The Last Wish"
"The Hexer".
In the episode 7, "Dolina Kwiatów", of The Hexer TV series, Lille was played by Małgorzata Lipmann.

Nettly (Polish: "Pokrzywka"), was a peasant from Lower Posada in Dol Blathanna who'd been visiting Upper Posada when Geralt and Dandelion were the area, looking for work. When it became clear there was no work for the witcher there, the two left and Nettly hurried after them on the road, as back in Lower Posada they were dealing with a "deovel" and could use the witcher's help in the matter.

Torque was a sylvan who lived in the fields of Lower Posada in Dol Blathanna. He tried to help the elves who lived in the Blue Mountains, and had an agreement with them: bring the elves grain and corn and other agricultural goods, without killing humans.
Biography.
For a time, Torque had been a minor nuisance to the Lower Posada villagers, occasionally stealing items and playing pranks, but because he also helped out occasionally they didn't care to do anything about him. However, he started to ramp up his antics to the point when Nettly saw the witcher Geralt in Upper Posada, he asked for his help in dealing with the "deovel" back home in Lower Posada.
When Geralt arrived with his friend Dandelion, they were told to simply get rid of, but not kill, the "deovel". On investigating, Geralt learned it was a sylvan but before he could talk with him, Dandelion made some rude remarks and angered Torque, who began to pelt iron balls at them and Geralt and the bard retreated.
The next day, Geralt returned and Torque tried to play games and riddles that only he knew how to do, before the two started to scuffle in the clearing, including Geralt spitting in Torque's ear after Torque had spat at Geralt. As the sylvan began to run off, Geralt called for Dandelion to give chase, only for the witcher to be knocked out by an unknown rider.
It was later revealed that Torque had made a deal with the elves that lived in Dol Blathanna: he'd learn how the humans in Lower Posada farmed and take some of their crops and seeds to give to the elves, who didn't know anything about agriculture and were thus starving in the mountains. When Geralt and Dandelion came around after being tied up, the two began to have a spat with the elves while Torque watched on. However, when one of the elves, Toruviel, made disparaging remarks and broke Dandelion's lute, Geralt managed to headbutt her in retaliation and Torque tried to step in to defend the captives, stating it was Toruviel's fault in the first place that she was hit. However, this fell on deaf ears and the elves' leader, Filavandrel, ordered the elves to kill Geralt and Dandelion. Torque put himself between the elves and the witcher and bard, saying this wasn't right, though Geralt asked him to stand down as it'd be pointless for him to die with them. Fortunately, the Queen of the Fields appeared and, after silently communicating with the elves, they untied the captives and left.
Later, Torque sat with Geralt and Dandelion around a campfire as the witcher read over the villagers' ancient book.
Appearance.
The creature was about half a rod tall with bulging eyes and a goat's horns and beard. The mouth, a soft, busy slit, also brought a chewing goat to mind. Its nether regions were covered with long, thick, dark-red hair right down to the cleft hooves. The devil had a long tail ending in a brush-like tassel which wagged energetically. pg. 176, "The Last Wish" (U.K. edition)
