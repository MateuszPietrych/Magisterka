The Witcher (Polish: "Wiedźmin") is a role-playing video game for the PC, developed by CD PROJEKT RED and published by Atari. Based on "The Witcher" series of the same name by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, the game utilizes 's proprietary Aurora Engine and was released in October 2007. An of the game, containing among other things the editor and two new adventures: "The Price of Neutrality" premium module and "Side Effects" premium module, was released in September 2008. In the first 10 months following its release, the game sold 800,000 copies worldwide. A console version using an entirely new engine and combat system, titled "", was planned for release in Fall 2009, but development was suspended indefinitely on May 6, 2009.
"The Witcher" follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a witcher: a traveling monster hunter for hire, gifted with unnatural powers. Taking place in a fictional medieval world, the game implements detailed visuals. The natural light during various phases of the day is realistically altered, and the day and night transitions serve to enrich the game's ambiance. The weather can dynamically change from a light drizzle to a dark, stormy downpour accompanied by thunder and lightning, and the NPCs react to the rain by hiding under roofs trying to get out of the rain.
Storyline.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher storyline."
The game is centred on Geralt the witcher, also known as "the White Wolf", who at the beginning of the game suffers from amnesia. He gradually learns that he was a very renowned witcher, and that he had friends and enemies almost everywhere, who remember him but whom he does not remember. Through the player's actions, he will redefine those relationships and choose his path in the political intrigue that surrounds him.
Story Motivations.
The developers have often said that their main goal with the game's storyline was to give choices to the player where there was no clear good or evil, and where the player would have to choose the lesser of two (or more) evils.
Also, the story was designed so that the consequences of the player's choices are often not immediately visible, and may only become apparent a few chapters later. This was done to prevent the "save, choose, reload" type of gameplay that is often used in similar computer role-playing games.[""]
Gameplay.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher gameplay."
There are three camera styles available when playing "The Witcher". The game can be played from one of two top-down perspectives, in which case the mouse is used to control everything, or it can be played from an over-the-shoulder (OTS) view, which brings the player closer to the in-game combat, but limits visibility. In all three views the keyboard and mouse controls can be changed to be primarily mouse focused, or a combined keyboard-and-mouse approach.
The combat system in The Witcher represents a departure from most RPGs. Players choose one of three fighting styles. The quick style allows for faster, less-damaging attacks with a greater chance of hitting faster enemies; the heavy style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style, which features sweeping attacks best used if the player is surrounded. The player can switch between the styles at any point.
Each of these stances has its own unique combat style. Both of Geralt's main swords, steel and silver, have distinctively different combat styles from the rest of his weaponry, and serve very distinct purposes: where the steel blade is used to fight and other flesh-and-blood beings, the silver is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts (some of which may be completely unaffected by steel).
 is a major part of gameplay. The player can create that increase health or endurance regeneration, allow Geralt to see in the dark, or provide other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion he can choose to drink it, but if the potion is a failure it will poison the character. Each time Geralt drinks potions they increase the toxicity level of his body. This can be reduced by drinking a special potion or by meditating at an inn or fireplace.
In addition to potions, the player can also create and , respectively used to augment the damage done by weapons, or as weapons in combat. Neither can be created until talent points have been allocated into the corresponding skills.
Soundtrack.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher soundtrack."
The soundtrack for "The Witcher" was composed by Adam Skorupa and Paweł Błaszczak. In some editions of the game (see: list of editions) the soundtrack CD is included with the game. It consists of 29 tracks with the total length of 73 minutes 13 seconds.
An additional CD, "Inspired by The Witcher", featuring e.g. Vader is sold separately in some countries and also included with the game in some editions.
Both soundtracks are included in the .
Add-Ons.
Enhanced Edition.
"For the main article, see ."
At the 2008 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, CD PROJEKT RED announced an enhanced edition of The Witcher, which contained a great number of technical upgrades, as well as a lot of new features, including two premium models: "The Price of Neutrality" premium module and "Side Effects" premium module.
Adventures.
Adventures are self-contained modules created by those outside of CD PROJEKT RED. However, the ones listed below were later officially included into the main game with Patch 1.5:
Canceled Add-Ons.
"The Witcher: Scars of Betrayal" is a canceled add-on for The Witcher. It was in development by Ossian Studios for some time in 2008 but was canceled.
"The Witcher: Outcast" was a planned add-on for The Witcher that was in development by roXidy but was canceled.
Technical Information.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher technical information."
"The Witcher" is powered by a new version of the BioWare Aurora Engine, modified for a single-player experience. A number of changes have been introduced to the original BioWare Aurora Engine, as well as troubleshooting and modding information, also described in the The Witcher technical information article.
Localization Variations.
All the female portrait cards shown after Geralt's "conquests" were retouched to a more modest standard for the US release version. The in-game Dryad was also reskinned so her hair covered more of her body in this release.
Colorful dialogue between characters was cut in all English releases, especially through shortening of dialogue. Lead Designer Michał Madej has disputed claims by fans that this was due to the sometimes crude language, but that the decision to edit down dialogue occurred because of production-related concerns in game development. Proof reader Martin Pagan noticed this shortened version during his work and writer Sande Chen confirmed that it was not due to censorship. Fans have theorized that it may have been done for voice acting cost savings, especially since much of the vulgar language has been retained. Such cost savings would normally occur during any shortening of dialogue, even in cases where no major crudity was involved.
The Enhanced Edition, however, contains the originally cut dialog with full voice acting.

Witcher

A witcher (Polish: "wiedźmin"), also known as a wiccan, hexer, vedymin, or witchman (Elder Speech: "vatt'ghern"), is someone who has undergone extensive training, ruthless mental and physical conditioning, and mysterious rituals (which take place at "witcher schools" such as Kaer Morhen) in preparation for becoming an itinerant monster slayer for hire. Geralt, the central character in Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher series and the subsequent games inspired by them, is said in the stories to be one of the greatest witchers; he is certainly legendary, but whether famous or infamous is more open to interpretation (and/or subject to gameplay, as the case may be).
History.
Creation.
As humans settled in the northern part of the Continent, they had to deal with a vast array of monsters that inhabited the land and which humans were poorly equipped to deal with. To fix this, the Northern rulers tasked their mages to create magic-wielding warriors to deal with the monsters for them. As a result, the mages carried out experiments at Rissberg and the first witcher was created. Unfortunately, the witchers proved to have limited magical potential and were thus deemed failures and banished from the castle.
The First Age of Witchers.
"For more information, see :Order of Witchers."
After the witchers were banished they were brought to Castle Morgraig by a handful of mages who wished to continue the experiment. Here, the first generation of witchers continued to train while the mages created more, soon establishing the Order of Witchers. As the first five original witchers set out on the path, the first age of witchers began. However, over time, the Order, after being abandoned by the original mages, had a violent fight break out among their own resulting in several deaths and a schism, and with other witchers' growing disillusionment about their Order's purpose and leaving as well, eventually led to the Order's end when the final witchers abandoned Morgraig, and thus brought the first age of witchers to an end as well.
Second Era of Witchers.
After the Order ended and the six independent schools were built, the Second Era of Witchers began, which witchers themselves refer to as the Golden Age of Witchers. With the continent divided between the schools and each one creating their own witchers, their work became efficiently organized. Past tensions between them calmed down and when witchers from different schools crossed paths, no blood was shed as each knew they had their own territory, making them treat other schools more like estranged brothers than bitter enemies like before.
End of the Golden Age.
By the mid 1160s, the witchers had been too successful. Monsters grew increasingly rare and, due to propaganda from the churches of the North and the distrust of the rulers, witchers became the monsters in most of the population's eyes. Almost every known school came under attack from various people and by the time the last school fell, the number of witchers had diminished greatly.
Overview.
Genetic advantages and disadvantages to being a Witcher.
Taken in as children, witchers-to-be are subjected to intense alchemical processes, consumption of mutagenic compounds, and relentless physical and magical training to make them dangerous and highly versatile against their vast array of opponents, many of which possess superhuman speed, strength and/or other deadly powers. These procedures ultimately mean that each fully-trained witcher is a mutant built specifically to hunt and kill inhuman prey. The key permanent results of mutations shared by all witchers include:
Equipment and skills.
Though they cover proficiency in basically any weapon that comes to hand, a witcher's training focuses on two primary tools:
 The Steel sword
 The Silver sword
These swords are typically carried on the back. A steel blade is used for more mundane beings, while a silver blade is reserved for beasts of the supernatural. Witchers are also frequent mixers and users of powerful , having developed an advanced tolerance to their inherent toxicity, but still limited to a few at a time (even one of their weaker brews would be fatal to an ordinary human). Witchers are trained to utilize bombs and various poisons and oils with which to coat their blades, many of which were designed to harm specific monsters. The first witchers were trained by alchemists from Vicovaro. Moreover, witchers are master trackers capable of tracking virtually any creature, be it monster, animal, human or nonhuman. The original witchers were trained by hunters from Kaedwen. After the varying schools were built the first generation witchers passed their knowledge to their apprentices.[8] Finally, their formal magical training deals with signs, a low-level yet versatile form of magic that allows witchers to cast spells and enchantments with simple hand gestures. Without extensive improvement and practice, these are mere tricks compared to what a sorceress can do, but they serve very well for someone with a sword in one hand to add a variety of improvisation to their efforts. Also, the more powerful magic used by mages often takes a lot of time to prepare while all signs are instantaneous. Additionally, witchers are trained by seasoned mages in how to use these signs to the best effect. Several witchers from different schools utilized one-handed crossbows, however, it was not very common.
In general, a witcher is a formidable and often overwhelming opponent to more mundane races thanks to their superhuman physical prowess, regenerative capabilities, and magic. However, they are not infallible, as they can still make mistakes, take a misstep in battle against mundane men or supernatural demons, or be overwhelmed by sheer numbers and individuals who have the skill to match a witcher, though rare is the individual who managed to slay a witcher out of skill rather than dumb luck or by ambush.
Though a witcher's eyes are one way to stick out, another standard means of identification is the witcher medallion. This device aids in the detection of monsters, and no witcher would part with one willingly. (And of course, witchers are known for being 'hard to kill' - Leo Bonhart boasts a collection of three such medallions as proof of his martial skill.) The form of an individual medallion (head of a wolf, cat, griffin, etc.) indicates the school at which its owner was trained.
It is a common belief, even among witchers themselves, that they have no capacity for emotion. This may be debatable, and rather relative, considering the rigors of their training and the dangers they face on a day-to-day basis. Perhaps they have simply never had the time or exposure to society to develop or recognize the reactions to mundane experiences that most take for granted. It may also be explained that a combination of their hard training, genetic modifications, and seclusion from society that may encourage blunted emotional expressions, as Geralt, Lambert, and Eskel all exhibit emotional heights concerning love, joy, fear, anger, lust, and sympathy among various others.
Occasional references to witchers as 'nonhuman' are somewhat at odds with the original stories (in which Geralt only identifies witcher as a profession, never a race). There is certainly no official classification as such, and the relevant references (in the first game at least) are usually from Geralt identifying with the mistrust and/or hostility faced by elves and dwarves in human society. Likely it is used as a slur against the mutants, likening them to elves and dwarves, though it's worth noting that an in-game text found in "Wild Hunt" mentions that the Cat School of witchers "are for the most part of elven stock," indicating that there are (or were at one time) indeed nonhuman witchers. Whether or not there actually are any elven witchers during the contemporary timeline of the story is unknown.

Glossary Entry.
Witchers
 "Witchers came into being when the first settlers were colonizing the untamed lands of present-day Temeria. The elite caste of warrior-monks was to defend humans from the monsters which inhabited the wild. Thanks to mutagenic mushrooms, herbs, and plant stimulants, the bodies of young apprentices developed superhuman speed and endurance. As a result of the painful and dangerous Trial of the Grasses, young witchers gained cat-like eyes, which allowed them to see in the dark. With the help of sorcerers, they learned to utilize simple combat spells, called signs, as well as magic potions that augmented their fighting skills. Nowadays, when monsters have become something of a rarity, the demand for the witchers' services has declined significantly. Only a few representatives of the caste still travel the world, and no more monster slayers are being made."
 "Due to their otherness, unusual abilities, and magicals skills, witchers are treated as outcasts and sometimes even met with hatred. This hatred was made manifest during the infamous attack on Kaer Morhen, which led to the destruction of the fortress and the death of most of the witchers wintering there. Those who survived are doomed to extinction since they no longer train successors." 
"People need witchers, but are simultaneously afraid of them. The itinerant warriors inspire fear because they are mutants and have superhuman powers. A witcher is rarely a welcome guest and contacts with members of this profession are almost always limited to business. Witchers are invariably attacked during pogroms and social upheavals directed against those who deal in magic."
"Mutagens and magic render witchers' bodies resistant to all kinds of disease, even to the point of outright immunity." 
"Despite my long friendship with Geralt, I know little more about this peculiar brotherhood or guild than learned tomes provide. On top of that, I am obliged to discretion, so I shall write nothing more than necessary on the subject. Once as numerous as the beasts they fought, today the witchers are seen as a relic of times long gone. The exact character of their training remains a mystery. It is known it consists, among others, of the Trials - processes that transform the organism using a specific combination of secret herbs and infusions. Those who survive them gain superhuman reflexes, speed of reaction, the ability to see in the dark and many other traits making them lethal foes. During their training they learn swordplay and basic magic, known as signs. Armed with this set of abilities, the witchers can effectively fulfill their objective, that is protecting humans from the monsters inhabiting our world."
Name.
The original Polish name for "witcher" is "wiedźmin". The English translation preferred by Andrzej Sapkowski was initially called a "hexer" and is the name used in the international version of the film adaptation. However, CD PROJEKT RED chose to translate it to "witcher" in the computer game, and this word was subsequently adopted by Danusia Stok (in her translation of "The Last Wish") and even by Sapkowski himself (in "Historia i fantastyka").
"Warlock" has been used in informal English translations, although "witcher" - being a neologism in English - is arguably better at capturing the spirit of Geralt's and a witcher's profession.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Andrzej Sapkowski, born 21 June 1948 in Łódź, is a Polish fantasy writer. Sapkowski studied economics and, before turning to writing, he worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. His first short story, "The Witcher" ("Wiedźmin"), was published in Fantastyka, Poland's leading fantasy literary magazine, in 1986 and was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a series of tales based on the world of "The Witcher", comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works made him one of the best-known fantasy authors in Poland in the 1990s.
The main character of the stories is witcher Geralt, a mutant assassin who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to Raymond Chandler's signature character Philip Marlowe. The world in which these adventures take place owes much to J.R.R. Tolkien, while being also heavily influenced by Polish history and Slavic mythology.
Awards.
Sapkowski has won five , including three for short stories "The Lesser Evil" (1990), "The Sword of Destiny" (1992), and "W leju po bombie" (In a Bomb Crater) (1993), and two for the novels "Blood of Elves" (1994) and "Narrenturm" (2002). He also won the Spanish Ignotus Award, best anthology, for "The Last Wish" in 2003, and for "Muzykanci" (The Musicians), best foreign short story, same year.
In 1997, Sapkowski won the prestigious Polityka Passport award, which is awarded annually to artists who have strong prospects for international success.
Adaptations.
In 2001, a television series based on the Witcher series was released in Poland and internationally, entitled "The Hexer" ("Wiedźmin"). A film by the same title was compiled from excerpts of the television series but both have been critical and box office failures.
Sapkowski's books have been translated into Czech, Finnish, Estonian, Russian, Lithuanian, German, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Serbian.
On October 26, 2007, Polish game publisher CD PROJEKT RED released a PC game based on this universe, called "The Witcher". It was very well received and a commercial success, selling over 1.5 million retail copies to date. Two more games were later released: ' on May 17, 2011, and ' on May 19, 2015.
Biography.
Andrzej Sapkowski is a graduate of the University of Łódź, where he studied foreign trade. Subsequently, he worked in that field. Only later did his literary career begin, as a translator, translating the English story "The Words of the Guru" by Cyril M. Kornbluth for "Fantastyka" magazine. In 1986 he released his first work of fiction, the short story "The Witcher" (translated also as "The Hexer" or "The Spellmaker") in order to enter a contest by a Polish literary magazine "Fantastyka". He won the 3rd prize. The story was succesful with critics and audiences. He would go on to create the successful Witcher series.

The Hexer

The Hexer (Polish: "Wiedźmin") is the international title of both a movie (2001) and a television series (2002) based on the witcher short stories by Andrzej Sapkowski, although it is more commonly referred to as The Witcher by fans since the release of "The Witcher". Both the movie and the television series were directed by Marek Brodzki, written by Michał Szczerbic, and produced by Lew Rywin. The role of Geralt was played by Michał Żebrowski, and the music was composed by Grzegorz Ciechowski.
The theatrical movie was essentially the then-unreleased TV series chopped into about 2 hours, and received very poor reviews from both fans and critics. The 13-episode TV series came out the following year. The series was much more coherent than the confusing movie, but was still considered a failure mostly due to the film's already bad reputation and due to vast changes to the source material.

The Last Wish (Polish: "Ostatnie życzenie") is the first book in Andrzej Sapkowski's "The Witcher" series in terms of story chronology, although the original Polish edition was published in 1993, after "Sword of Destiny".
Some of the individual short stories were first published in the "Fantastyka" magazine or in the "Wiedźmin" short story collection (the first collection of Sapkowski's stories, out of print and now obsolete; all short stories were later collected in "The Last Wish", "Sword of Destiny" and "Something Ends, Something Begins") and as such were the first witcher stories published.
The first UK edition was released by Gollancz on 7 June 2007 and a second edition was released the next year on 14 February 2008. The US edition was released a few months later, on 1 May 2008 by Orbit.
Audible UK, in conjunction with Orion Books and Gollancz, released "The Last Wish" audio on February 27, 2014, only a few short weeks after it was announced. "The Last Wish" is read by Peter Kenny.
Stories Included.
The anthology employs the story within a story framework and contains seven main short stories.
Geralt, after having been injured in battle, rests in a temple of Melitele in Ellander. During that time he has flashbacks to recent events in his life — each of which forms a story of its own.
Audio Versions.
There are two audio versions of "The Last Wish" available in Polish. Classic audiobook, lasting about 11 hours and read by Roch Siemianowski, was released by superNOWA (Polish publisher of Sapkowski's works) in 1996.
In 2011, after the huge success of audio play based on Sapkowski's "Narrenturm", Fonopolis and audioteka.pl released audio plays based on "The Last Wish" and "Sword of Destiny". "The Last Wish", lasting about 12 hours, was voiced by 52 actors, including Krzysztof Banaszyk (Vernon Roche in "Assassins of Kings") as Geralt, Anna Dereszowska as Yennefer, Sławimir Pacek (minor characters in video games) as Dandelion and Krzysztof Gosztyła as narrator. Samples from all short stories can be found on audioteka.pl's site.
Bagiński Film.
A movie adaptation announced for 2017 states that it: "will be based on themes from the short stories 'The Witcher' and 'Lesser Evil' from 'The Last Wish' collection. Tomasz Bagiński, who had been nominated for an Oscar for his film, 'The Cathedral', will be the director."

The Witcher series

The Witcher (Polish: "Cykl wiedźmiński") by Andrzej Sapkowski is a series of fantasy short stories (collected in two books, except for two stories) and five novels about the witcher Geralt of Rivia. The books have been adapted into a movie and two television series ("The Hexer" and Netflix's "The Witcher"), a video game series ("The Witcher"), a comic book and others. The novel series (excluding the short stories) is also called the Witcher Saga (Polish: "saga o wiedźminie") or the Blood of the Elves saga.
The books.
Note: For books not yet translated into English, approximate translations are given in parentheses.
Publishing history.
Short stories.
The Witcher series started as a series of short stories, at first published in "Fantastyka", a Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine. The first short story, "Wiedźmin" ("The Witcher") (1986), was written for a contest held by the magazine, where it won third place. The first four stories of the witcher Geralt — and the story "Droga, z której się nie wraca" ("The Road with No Return"), which took place in the same world, but dozens of years before the witcher stories — were originally collected in a short story collection titled Wiedźmin (out of print and now obsolete; all fifteen short stories were later collected in three books published by superNOWA.)
The second short story collection to be published was "Sword of Destiny". While "The Last Wish" was published after it, it replaced "Wiedźmin" as the first book, as it included all of the stories collected in "Wiedźmin" except "Droga, z ktorej się nie wraca" (the only one not featuring Geralt). Although new short stories were added in "The Last Wish", they took place before the ones in S"word of Destiny".
"Droga, z której się nie wraca", along with "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna", a non-canon story about Geralt and Yennefer's wedding, written as a wedding gift for Sapkowski's friends, were later published in the book "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna ("Something Ends, Something Begins")". The rest of the stories in this book are not connected to the Witcher series in any way. In some Polish editions, "Droga, z której się nie wraca" and "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna" are added to either "The Last Wish" or "Sword of Destiny".
Translations.
The stories and novels have been translated into Dutch, Bulgarian, Czech, Serbian, Swedish, Russian, German, Italian, Lithuanian, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, Finnish, Hungarian and Slovak. An English translation of "The Last Wish", the first short story collection, was published in the United Kingdom by Gollancz in 2007 and in the United States by Orbit in 2008. Gollancz decided to skip "Sword of Destiny", the second short story collection, and publish "Blood of Elves", the first novel in the "Witcher Saga" in the United Kingdom directly after "The Last Wish", even though the short stories in this collection take place earlier and introduce some of the characters that become major characters in the novels. "Blood of Elves" was published in 2009 by Orbit in the United States. As of 2018, all eight books (not including "Coś się kończy, coś się zaczyna", as it only partially features the Witcher world) have been translated into English.
The name "witcher".
The original Polish name for "witcher" is "wiedźmin". The English translation preferred by Andrzej Sapkowski was initially "hexer" and is the name used in the international version of the film adaptation. However, CD PROJEKT RED chose to translate it to "witcher" in "The Witcher", and this version was subsequently used by Danusia Stok in her translation of the book "The Last Wish", as well as by Sapkowski himself in the book "Historia i fantastyka".
Alternatively, the word "warlock" has been used informally in English translations, while "witcher", being a neologism in English (as "wiedźmin" is in Polish) arguably describes better the spirit of Geralt's profession.
In the Witcher fictional universe, "witcher" was a derogatory term constructed from the word "witch" (an exact translation of Polish word "wiedźma") and used by the sorcerers to describe males with limited magical ability.
Setting and story.
Both short stories and novels are widely claimed by fans to be blockbusters of Polish fantasy. Geralt's stories are praised for their slightly ironic sense of humor and subtle links to modern culture (e.g. one of the wizards taking part in the Gathering of the Wizards is constantly complaining about "ecological" issues). Moreover, quite contrary to the classical fantasy scheme, there is no black-white partitioning. On the other hand, Geralt's world is not a typical dark-fantasy. Sapkowski tries to emphasize the scale of grays in everyone (e.g. one of the local rulers engaged in incestous relation with own sister shows as caring father — at least according to Geralt's world standards).
The "Blood of Elves" series proper consists of the five novels about Geralt, in which Sapkowski links together the plotlines begun in the short stories, and adds new ones. Apart from Geralt himself, another central character is Princess Ciri. Their story is set against the background of the struggle of the Northern Kingdoms against the Nilfgaardian Empire.
Adaptations.
Comic books.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher (comics)."
In 1993-1995, Sapkowski's stories were adapted into six graphic novels (comic books) by Maciej Parowski (story), Bogusław Polch (art), and Sapkowski himself. They are:
In 2011, two-issue miniseries titled "" was published by Egmont. It was not based on any of the novels or short stories but contained new adventures of Geralt. It was written by Michał Gałek, illustrated by Arkadiusz Klimek and colorized by Łukasz Poller. It is part of CD PROJEKT RED's "The Witcher" franchise.
In 2014, a new series of comic books, written by Paul Tobin and illustrated by Joe Querio and published by Dark Horse Comics was started. While the first storyline, ', is an original story, the second one, ', is an adaptation of one of the chapters of Andrzej Sapkowski's "Season of Storms" novel. Third, called "" is an original story continuing "The Witcher 3".
In September 2021, CD PROJEKT RED crowdfunded "", a manga that sets Geralt in ancient Japan where he must venture across Yokai-infested lands while attempting to track down the mysterious Lady of Snow Yuki Onna. It was successfully funded and backers started to get it in March 2022 while it's expected to be released in November 2022 for non-backers.
Film and television.
"The Hexer" is the international title of both a "Wiedźmin" movie (2001) and television series (2002) directed by Marek Brodzki, written by Michał Szczerbic, and produced by Lew Rywin. The role of Geralt was played by Michał Żebrowski, and the music was composed by Grzegorz Ciechowski. The film was essentially the then-unreleased TV series chopped into about 2 hours, and received very poor reviews from both fans and critics.
The 13-episode TV series came out the following year. The series was much more coherent than the confusing movie, but was still considered a failure. The TV series has been unofficially released with English subtitles on the Internet.
Games.
Role-playing game.
In 2001 a pen and paper role-playing game called "" ("The Witcher: A Game of Imagination"), based on Sapkowski's books, was published by MAG.
CD PROJEKT RED game series.
"For the main article, see :CD PROJEKT RED's The Witcher franchise."
A 2007 computer role-playing game based on Sapkowski's saga called "The Witcher" was developed by CD PROJEKT RED, and was released in Europe on October 26, and the US on October 30. It was advertised far more than its predecessor, and although it was CD PROJEKT RED's first game, it was received very well by reviewers in both the EU and the US, and was considered very successful. CD PROJEKT RED utilized the large gap between the graphical capabilities of high-end PC hardware and the then current generation of consoles to provide a gaming experience beyond what consoles could support at the time.
The computer game's plot is set 5 years after the end of "Lady of the Lake" (the last book of the series). The sequel, ', was released in May 2011. The latest game in the Witcher series, ', was released in May 2015.

Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.
During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.
Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him. He, therefore, became a true knight.
Biography.
Geralt was born as the son of the sorceress Visenna and presumably, the warrior Korin. Shortly after his birth, his mother left him with the School of the Wolf at the stronghold of Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt was made and trained to become a Witcher.
As a child, he was subjected to the Trial of The Grasses. He managed to survive the many blistering mutations required to grant Witchers their abilities. After displaying unusual tolerance, Geralt was selected for further experimental mutations which granted him considerably greater strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing, senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and extreme resistance to pain. This resulted in his hair turning white, and he received the nickname "White Wolf".
Geralt was trained by his mentor Vesemir, whom he came to regard as a father figure. He soon met his fellow classmate Eskel, and the two became good friends and as close as brothers. One time, they captured a large forest bumblebee and tied it to a jug. The pair laughed at its antics until they were discovered by Vesemir who punished them with a leather strap. 
Early life.
During his training at the witcher school, he made friends with several students, such as Gweld and Eskel, and was trained by Vesemir in harsh conditions, one of which resulted in a student dying.
Geralt was eventually put through the Trial of Forest Eyes, where he was left tied up in the woods and blindfolded and needed to return to the keep by the morning or he would fail. He was helped out of his binds by the elf Aideen, and they went to look at the non-human reservation to find the camp had been attacked by vrans. They then left and came across some Cat School witchers training and wrestling. Aideen then unbound Geralt and left him to return to his master.
Later on, the Wolf School and the Cat School had a tournament between them, organized by King Radowit II, who secretly plotted with the Cat School to kill the witchers from the Wolf School. In the first round, Geralt and Gweld faced off, slowly realizing while they were fighting that the whole tournament was a ruse. As they came to that realization, however, a druid put a mind control spell upon Gweld which made him violently attack Geralt, forcing Geralt to kill his friend with a sword through the chest. Right after this, soldiers under Radowit's command surrounded the witchers and started to kill them all, but Geralt was able to escape on horseback, causing Radowit to put a bounty on his head.
Geralt then came across Aideen again in the woods, who persuaded him not to kill the soldiers who slaughtered his fellow witchers, though he did kill one of Radowit's men that he saw along his trip back to Hertch, where he warned the elders about Radowit and the Cat School's betrayal.
Due to his brilliant success in training, Geralt was selected for additional mutation experiments. He was the only witcher to have survived these experiments, his stark white hair being a side effect of these additional mutations. He also spent time training with Mother Nenneke at the Temple of Melitele in Ellander, and studied at Oxenfurt Academy, where he attended some lectures including astronomy. After completing his witcher training, Geralt set off into the world on a horse named Roach, a name he would bestow upon every one of his later horses. Thus, he became a monster slayer for hire.
Originally, Geralt was convicted and enthusiastic, holding faith that he was needed in a world full of monsters and beasts to protect the innocent, although Vesemir greatly advised him not to play at being a knight errant or uphold the law. After travelling about 50 miles after leaving Kaer Morhen, Geralt was anxious to kill his first monster. He encountered a bald man with rotten teeth, who stopped a peasant's cart and pulled out a young girl whilst his companions held down her father as the bald man tore off her dress yelling it was time for her to meet a real man and attempted to rape her. Geralt rode up and told him the time had come for him to meet one too. The thug released the girl and charged at him with an axe. Geralt managed to strike him twice with his blade and killed him. The young witcher turned, expecting gratitude, but the father fled with the attackers, and the girl, who was drenched in the man's blood, vomited, became hysterical, and then fainted in fear when Geralt approached her. This event caused Geralt to rarely interfere with such matters.
Over the years, Geralt traveled across the continent. He visited towns and fortresses looking for proclamations nailed to the posts at crossroads with the words 'Witcher urgently needed'. His adventures led him to sacred sites, dungeons, necropolis, ruins, forest ravines, and hidden grottos in the mountains. Throughout his career he killed a manticore, wyvern, fogler, aeschna, ilyocoris, chimera, leshy, vampire, ghoul, graveir, werewolf, giant scorpion, striga, black annis, kikimore, and several other creatures.
Butcher of Blaviken.
Geralt once visited the town of Blaviken and befriended the local alderman, Caldemeyn. He was invited into his house to share a meal with his family. During their supper, Geralt threw his fork at a rat in complete darkness and killed it in order to practise his witcher senses which he found to be amusing. However, the alderman's wife, Libushe, harbored a distrustful opinion of the witcher.
An unknown time later, he killed an amphisbaena and went to the court of King Idi of Kovir, where he handed in the head of the beast. However the king's mages, Zavist and Stregobor, told the king that Geralt was little more than a charlatan, so the king didn't pay the witcher anything and demanded he leave Kovir in 12 hours, which Geralt was barely able to do on account of the king's hourglass being broken.
Two years later he made his way to Blaviken where the alderman, Caldemeyn, was happy to see the witcher after so many years since Geralt's last visit. While he couldn't offer a reward on a kikimore that Geralt killed nearby, his guards suggested the local mage, Irion, might have some use for it. However, when they arrived at the mage's tower, Geralt immediately saw Irion was actually none other than Stregobor. Once the witcher and mage were alone, the two discussed the past, with Geralt sardonically remarking on how Stregobor talked the former King Idi out of paying him back in Kovir. Pushing this aside, Stregobor revealed he needed Geralt's help: Renfri, a bandit and the leader of a gang, was in town looking to kill him, and therefore he wished for the witcher to kill Renfri. Unfazed by this, Geralt remarked it wasn't his problem and left.
Later that night, Geralt and Caldemeyn went to The Golden Court, the town's inn where Renfri was staying. Geralt found her gang, though none of them were very cooperative and just made jokes until one member, Fifteen, challenged him to a fight. However, before it could begin, Renfri appeared and went to talk to Geralt and Caldemeyn in private, with the latter demanding she leave town or be thrown in jail. Unperturbed, Renfri revealed a letter of safe conduct from King Audoen which gave her immunity in Hengfors and Arcsea. After another short discussion, Geralt and the alderman left.
That night, as Geralt went to his guest room in Caldemeyn's home, he found Renfri there. She eventually revealed her entire past, including how Stregobor played a part in banishing the princess from her own kingdom on account of her being born during a black sun, putting into play a constant struggle between the two: her trying to kill the mage and the mage trying to kill her. She then asked Geralt to help her kill Stregobor, but the witcher once again refused to take sides. After telling her she should leave town, Renfri remarked on the Tridam ultimatum, before agreeing she'd leave the next day, but in the meantime wished to sleep with Geralt, who obliged.
The next morning though, as Geralt ate breakfast with Caldemeyn and his family, the alderman revealed the deadly meaning behind the Tridam ultimatum, making Geralt realize Renfri's ruse was to take the market-goers hostage. He ran off to the market, which was preparing for its busiest day of the year. When he arrived, he found Renfri's gang, who hadn't acted yet, as Renfri went off to give Stregobor the ultimatum first. Not wanting to take chances, Geralt fought with the gang, viciously killing them all off in front of the townspeople before Renfri showed up. She refused to stand down, forcing Geralt to fight and kill her as well. As she died, Stregobor appeared, having seen it all from his crystal ball, and wished to do an autopsy on the dead princess. However, Geralt threatened to slay the mage if he so much as touched Renfri's body, and thus Stregobor left to return to Kovir. The townspeople, not realizing how close they'd come to being hostages and killed off, proceeded to throw stones at Geralt for his actions until Caldemeyn stepped in to stop it. He then asked for Geralt to leave and never return to Blaviken.
Dealing with Eskel's child surprise.
In the fall of 1232, Geralt decided to return to Kaer Morhen early but along the way, his horse was killed by wolves, and he encountered several Caingornese camps. He stopped at one to meet Prince Merwin Ademeyn and the sorceress Sabrina Glevissig, as well as the dwarf Merton Bringgs. They had a proposition for Geralt but before Sabrina could discuss it, a pack of wolves attacked them. After they were killed, Geralt then talked to Sabrina who discussed the symptoms of the Curse of the Black Sun, who eventually turned the conversation to Merwin's sister, Deidre Ademeyn, who was in Kaer Morhen and having been born during an eclipse. Sabrina asked Geralt to retrieve her from the keep so she could give Deidre to the Council of Mages to be studied, and hopefully find a cure to the curse.
As Geralt left the tent, he was approached by Merwin, who showed him a scroll from King Henselt of Kaedwen, who told him that Merwin was under the protection of Kaedwen and anyone defying Merwin defied the kingdom. Shortly after in the woods, Geralt met Lambert, who had just killed some wolves, and explained that Merton Bringgs and his group of dwarves had tried to enter the keep, but Lambert caught them. As Geralt entered the keep, he found Vesemir who informed him that Deidre had returned a couple of days earlier, running from her envious brother and an evil sorceress, and that Eskel had told him that Deidre was actually his surprise child from about 20 years ago. Vesemir then told Geralt to go look for Eskel.
Geralt soon found Eskel, who explained how Deidre had become his surprise child, but ultimately hadn't decided if he should hand her over to Sabrina or not. The two then made their way back to Vesemir, who decided the 4 should vote on it, with it coming down to Geralt's choice as Eskel chose to trust whatever his fellow witcher decided.
"If Geralt voted to keep Deidre safe:" Geralt and Eskel convinced Deidre to go with them to the camp where the prince and the sorceress were. Once there though, despite Deidre agreeing she'd give up any claim to the throne and any titles and estates like her brother wanted, Sabrina then tried to have Merton arrest her. In the ensuing chaos, Deidre struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and killed Merton with her sword but Sabrina escaped through a portal. The witchers then entered a fight with Merwin's group before Geralt followed Deidre into Sabrina's tent where he found Deidre, Sabrina, and Merwin. Merwin asked Geralt to kill Deidre, but she pleaded for her life saying she didn't mean to hurt Eskel. Geralt then tried to convince Deidre to let her anger towards Sabrina and her brother go, as that was best for everyone.
"Geralt made Deidre drop her sword:" Geralt wasn't impressed that Deidre had struck Eskel and was also annoyed she lied about wanting a peaceful option. He then had to kill Deidre and her wolves.
"Geralt made Sabrina leave:" Geralt told the sorceress that her magic was useless and that she should just leave, which she did. Merwin and Deidre forgave each other and left for Caingorn.
"If Geralt told Deidre to leave the keep:" Geralt and Eskel informed Deidre she had to leave, with Eskel explaining she was putting Kaer Morhen in danger by being there. Angry at this, she struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and summoned archespores, which attacked the two witchers while she ran off. After dealing with the immediate threats, Geralt informed Vesemir about the situation before going to Sabrina to get her help to heal Eskel, the two later helping him to resolve the matter of Deidre's fate.
The rest of the winter at Kaer Morhen passed more peacefully and Geralt left come spring to continue his trade.
Adventures with Dandelion.
Geralt traveled to Gulet on witcher business, where he met Dandelion, a poet who later became his best friend, at a fête. Later Dandelion slept with a woman under the musicians' podium, who had four large brothers. Dandelion fled from the city with Geralt and started to build a friendship with him on their way southeast to Dol Blathanna.
After Gulet, Geralt and Dandelion stopped in Upper Posada to look for work, however the only "monster troubles" the people could come up with were tall tales and creatures that didn't actually exist, so the two soon left to find another place for work. However, on the road, they were soon approached by Nettly, who'd seen them in Upper Posada, and explained he did have business for the witcher, who accepted.
Geralt and Dandelion ate supper at the man's house where the group was joined by Dhun, the elder of Lower Posada, who eventually discussed a "deovel" named Torque, who had been somewhat helpful, when not occasionally pulling pranks on the villagers. These pranks were getting out of hand though and they needed something to get rid of Torque, but not kill him.
Agreeing to check it out, the witcher and bard went into the nearby hemp field where the "deovel" was known to stay and found "offerings" set up for the creature. As they looked around, Torque appeared but as Geralt tried to talk with the sylvan, Dandelion started to make jokes at Torque to the point the sylvan began to pelt small, iron balls at the two, making them run off.
After the attack, the two went back to Lower Posada where they met with Dhun and Nettly, who admitted that they had tried to outwit the "deovel" in the past, including trying to trick him into eating the iron pellets he'd thrown at the pair. Eventually, they brought out an old woman and her apprentice, Lille, along with an ancient book. While the old woman, a Wise One, couldn't read the book, she'd memorized it by heart from knowledge passed down to each wise woman, eventually revealing Torque was a sylvan and the reason they just wanted to drive him away was that Lille didn't want him killed.
With this in mind, the next day Geralt found Torque and, after a quick game of riddles, the witcher threw an iron ball which hit Torque in the forehead. This surprise attack gave Geralt the opportunity to capture Torque and signal to Dandelion, but a horse appeared and hit him, rendering the witcher unconscious.
Shortly after, Geralt woke up to find himself tied up along with Dandelion, with Torque giving Galarr, an elf from the Blue Mountains, three sacks of corn, revealing that Torque had been stealing the food to help the starving elves, as well as passing along agricultural tips he learned from the villagers as the elves didn't know how to farm the land. Noticing the awake prisoners, one of the elves, Toruviel, began to antagonize Geralt before kicking him and smashing Dandelion's lute. Angry at this latter act, Geralt managed to headbutt the elf and another moved to kill the witcher despite Torque's protests that Filavandrel aén Fidháil forbade killing, when Filavandrel himself showed up to stop everything.
However, it was clear that the leader planned to have the witcher and bard killed, as they were witnesses to what Torque had been doing, though during this Filavandrel and Geralt conversed, with Geralt noting the elf was filled with hatred towards humans and was, despite how his people were starving, too proud to try and cohabit with those he deemed "inferior". As the elves moved to shoot Geralt and Dandelion though, Torque stood in front of the pair, fruitlessly trying to defend anyone from being killed and ignoring Geralt's remark to stand aside. Feeling it was necessary, Filavandrel started to give the order to kill the three when Lille suddenly appeared, but in the form of the goddess Dana Meadbh. After silently communicating with the elves, she sent them riding back to the Blue Mountains, but not before Toruviel gave Dandelion her priceless lute for destroying his. Filavandrel then bade farewell to them, remarking Geralt was right about his earlier comments. Later that night, Geralt, Dandelion, and Torque made camp, with Geralt reading over the ancient book he'd collected as his prize for getting rid of Torque, who was moving on from Lower Posada.
Meeting Yennefer.
In 1249, Geralt and Dandelion traveled to a village where they went fishing but the line snapped and their meal escaped. The two started to fight about who was at fault and started to leave before Dandelion realized the line had caught an old jar that he thought might contain a djinn. On realizing there was a mage's seal on the jar, Geralt tried to warn the bard not to touch it but in their scuffle, the seal came off and the djinn appeared. As Geralt grabbed his swords, Dandelion began to make wishes, which only angered the djinn and it grabbed Dandelion's throat. With his weapons doing little damage, Geralt grabbed the seal out of desperation and used the words of an exorcism a priestess had taught him and miraculously the djinn ran off.
However, the bard was badly injured so Geralt hastily made for Rinde in hopes of finding someone to help. Despite Dandelion's severe injuries, anyone of low stature wasn't allowed to enter after sunset so all they could do was wait it out with the others there, including Chireadan, Errdil, and Vratimir. Eventually, the group revealed there was only one known mage in town who could help: Yennefer of Vengerberg who, despite King Heribert's orders that no magic users could stay in Redania, was staying with the honorary Novigrad ambassador, Beau Berrant, thus giving her asylum while she stayed with him.
As soon as sunrise hit, Geralt made his way to the ambassador's home, knocking out the doorman, Cerberus, in the process. While he searched the home for the sorceress, he ran into a drunk and naked Berrant, who mentioned a woman wanting juice before he passed out. Geralt got the apple juice, then made his way up to the sorceress' room and gave her the drink, who didn't notice at first that he was not Berrant as she was under the bed covers. However, once she appeared naked from under them, she quickly realized the situation and demanded answers from Geralt, who answered sarcastically, causing her to immediately cast a spell at him which Geralt tried to counter with Heliotrop. Desperate for her help, Geralt changed to a respectful tone, explaining why he'd intruded on her sleep, before eventually revealing the djinn and the exorcism statement he made. However, Yennefer remarked it wasn't an exorcism, just a witty, indecent comment before asking what drove the djinn away and the seal that'd been on the bottle. While Geralt noted it probably went to do one of Dandelion's wishes, he hid the truth about the seal, pretending Dandelion had it. The two then traveled by portal to Errdil's inn so that Yennefer could help the injured bard.
As Yennefer worked on healing Dandelion, Geralt and Chireadan discussed the sorceress, with the two men both revealing in their own ways they found her attractive, though the elf noted that Geralt should be wary of Yennefer, as she didn't do things to help others unless she was also getting something out of it. After some time, Yennefer then called the witcher up to the room to see Dandelion only to then release a magical trap on Geralt and reveal she knew he had the seal. After some back-and-forth comments, Geralt gave it to her as a gesture of goodwill that he'd pay her for her help, however, this was fruitless as Yennefer had something else in mind and Geralt quickly deduced she wanted to use Dandelion, who had a connection to the djinn, to try and lure it back to capture it for herself. The witcher adamantly refused to put Dandelion in danger again, but by then Yennefer's other spells took hold, paralyzing the witcher and obscuring the room in a magical shield so nobody could interfere. With that, she then told Geralt he was going to pay for her help by settling some of her accounts in Rinde before violently kissing him, which placed a hypnotic spell on the witcher before he soon lost consciousness.
Geralt woke to find himself in the city's dungeons with Chireadan, who revealed in his mind-controlled state that Geralt had beat up the local pawnbroker and his apprentice, spanked the local apothecary Laurelnose, took out a group of guards, then made his way to the temple while insulting the priest, Krepp, as all 3 were on the town council and had voted to kick Yennefer out of Rinde while also spreading vulgar gossip about her. However, before Geralt could make it to the temple he fainted and the guards threw him into the dungeons, with Chireadan having been caught in the chaos and thrown in as well. Just then, several guards sent by Laurelnose came in and began to beat up Geralt, but when the one throwing the punches asked if the witcher had any wishes, Geralt stated he just had one: that the guard would burst and, before another punch could be thrown, the guard's body literally burst, killing him instantly.
With that, Geralt and Chireadan were brought before the mayor, Neville, with Krepp also in attendance, with the latter noting it must have been the sorceress' work as neither the witcher nor elf had control of the force to do so. After revealing almost the entire story to the mayor and priest, Krepp then concluded Yennefer wanted the djinn as it would give the sorceress a great deal of power and when the conversation turned to what Geralt said that made the genie run off, Geralt repeated the supposed exorcism only for Krepp to become insulted by it. Before more could be asked on this, Dandelion suddenly fell into the room through a portal, proclaiming Geralt was innocent and that Yennefer had ordered him to state before the mayor his wish was for them to believe the witcher wasn't guilty. Krepp quickly deduced it was the sorceress' way of using the last wish to free the genie so she could capture it when the group heard a thunderous noise outside of the building and looked out to see the djinn flying above Errdil's tavern, having been magically lassoed by Yennefer. However, the djinn wasn't going down without a fight and was destroying all the nearby buildings as it tried to break free.
Wishing to save Yennefer, Geralt got Krepp to cast a spell to re-open the portal Dandelion had come through but not before asking what the words of the exorcism he said earlier meant, to which Krepp paraphrased that it meant "get out of here and go fuck yourself!". With that, Geralt entered the portal and landed in Errdil's tavern where Yennefer was still trying to capture the genie while her powers waned. Seeing Geralt, she opened a portal to send him away as the djinn entered the tavern through its own portal to kill the sorceress, but Geralt threw himself between the two, shielding Yennefer. Shockingly, the genie didn't attack the witcher, but appeared to roar in an unknown language at him. Trying to get Yennefer away from it, Geralt pulled the sorceress through the portal she'd opened, though she yelled and threw punches at the witcher, claiming she almost had the genie, before rushing back through the portal with Geralt trying to grab her once more. As they crashed back in the tavern, Yennefer managed to cast a spell to pin the witcher down, but Geralt, trying to save her, informed her of the truth: he was the one making the wishes as he'd been the one holding the seal when he made his first wish (the "exorcism") and had one wish left.
As a weakened Yennefer demanded Geralt make his last wish so she could hopelessly try to capture the genie, Geralt finally realized what he wanted and that would also save Yennefer from the genie's wrath and wished their fates be tied, thus freeing the genie while preventing it from killing the sorceress. With that, the genie escaped back to its realm, and Geralt and Yennefer proceeded to make love in the destroyed tavern.
Staying in Vengerberg.
After the events in Rinde, Yennefer and Geralt started a rather physical relationship, spending the majority of their time at Yennefer's home in Vengerberg, Aedirn, and putting to good use a wide variety of the sorceress' collection, including a stuffed unicorn, as well as having sex in rather unusual situations, like levitating 30 fathoms above the ground. However, the witcher finally decided to leave after half a year in the city, considering Yennefer's behavior as too possessive. Unable to initiate the parting though, the witcher ran off during the night, leaving only a rose and a letter on the bed as his farewell.
Stolen swords.

The cursed princess.
In 1252, Geralt traveled to Vizima and visited The Fox but, while trying to find a bed to rent, was attacked by three racists who didn't approve of his Rivian accent. A short fight unfolded where Geralt killed the men but right after members of the city guard appeared and attempted to arrest him, though using Axii, Geralt was able to manipulate them into taking him to Velerad, the city castellan, instead.
Once he met Velerad, the pair took time discussing the real reason Geralt was passing through: King Foltest of Temeria had put out a contract to cure his daughter, Adda the White, who was cursed and turned into a striga. After Geralt went and saw Foltest, they reached an agreement: for 3,000 orens, Geralt would try to successfully release Adda from her curse, without killing her, as many had attempted in the past. The witcher then discussed the plan further with Foltest's underlings, Ostrit, Velerad, and Segelin, who agreed the witcher should spend a night in the old city with the striga.
Four days later, after talking to survivors of the beast, speaking further with Foltest, and finalizing plans, Geralt traveled to the old, abandoned palace and set up camp there, preparing his potions and meditating before he was found by Ostrit in the dead city. The magnate then tried to bribe the witcher with 1,000 orens to leave the place and never return, all while keeping the cursed Adda in her form. As Geralt questioned Ostrit's reasoning, noting a striga on the loose would make people lose faith in their king and possibly remove Foltest, the magnate grew frustrated and tried to fight the witcher, who quickly knocked out the man and tied him up.
Ostrit came to shortly after and soon realized Geralt planned to use him as bait to lure out Adda. He then confessed to the witcher he did want to overthrow Foltest, but more than that, he wanted the king to suffer because Foltest had taken the one Ostrit had loved, Adda of Temeria, who was the king's own deceased sister and lover. However, he was adamant he couldn't have possibly caused the curse as he didn't know how to use magic and that Foltest and Adda's mother, Sancia of Sodden, must have done it as she too didn't agree with the incestuous relationship. Geralt, however, heard the beast start to move out of her crypt and cut the magnate loose, who quickly took off to try and fruitlessly escape but was quickly killed by the striga.
Geralt and the striga then faced off against each other, though Geralt took care not to kill her, only looking to buy enough time to get her away from her crypt. Eventually managing to send her running, Geralt quickly hid himself in her tomb and closed it, casting Yrden on the cover before meditating until dawn. Awaking a few hours later, right at dawn, he slipped out of the tomb to find Adda, now in human form, lying next to the tomb. However, as Geralt checked her teeth to make sure the transformation was complete, the still transforming girl awoke and slashed deep cuts in Geralt's neck with her talons. The witcher quickly pinned her down until she completely transformed back to human, but right after Geralt fainted from the blood loss.
Two days later, Geralt woke up in the new palace with Velerad looking after him, who explained they'd raced into the old palace right after dawn and found the badly injured witcher and saved him. Geralt then asked about the princess' condition and as the castellan explained she was fine, Geralt fell asleep once more.
Recovery in Ellander.
After fighting and releasing the striga, Geralt traveled to Ellander to recover at the Temple of Melitele. He was cared to by and quickly developed a relationship with one of the priestesses, Iola, who was studying under Nenneke, and ended up sleeping with her, as she reminded him of Yennefer. The next morning, the two were awoken by Nenneke, who didn't want them in a relationship together, so she sent Iola out to continue with her duties. The older priestess had a look at Geralt's injuries and then after some assessment, sent the witcher to go eat breakfast, before joining him again in the temple gardens.
The two then discussed Iola using magic to put Geralt in a trance, and maybe reveal something about his destiny and future, though the witcher didn't want to undergo such a thing. Not long after that, Count Falwick and Arthur Tailles, members of the Order of the White Rose, arrived at the temple and confronted Geralt and Nenneke, asking the witcher to leave Ellander by the orders of Duke Hereward. Tailles' attitude was met by Nenneke who declared the temple belonged to her and she decided who came and left, threatening the young knight with a small porcelain jar that was potentially harmful. Geralt decided to tell the men of his plans to leave Ellander in the next few days and adding insult to injury, started to insult Tailles, who furiously left the temple with his partner.
Geralt later went and saw Iola, explaining Kaer Morhen and his training as a witcher, as well as contracts he had taken throughout his life on the path. After spending some time alone and reading, Geralt was informed by Nenneke that Dandelion was at the temple to visit him, just before the poet turned around the corner. The two discussed recent events and Dandelion's education before the witcher bought out vodka and they started to drink, with Geralt complaining about a lack of work in the area. After his drink with Dandelion, Geralt went to the grotto in the garden and had a look at the many exotic herbs there while Nenneke harvested them. She asked him to stay a couple more days at the temple, which request was quickly turned down by the witcher, as he was preparing to leave that day.
After leaving the temple with Dandelion, the witcher started to ride towards the city of Ellander before he was confronted by Falwick, Tailles, and Dennis Cranmer, with Falwick declaring the young knight and the witcher must fight, as Tailles' pride had been injured at the temple. Falwick then informed Geralt that he had to throw the fight, as hitting the knight would have him arrested and thrown in front of Hereward. Geralt agreed to the fight and easily outmanoeuvred the young knight, making him hit himself in the face, which Falwick believed was worth Cranmer arresting Geralt according to his orders, but the dwarf believed that Tailles had hit himself and that wasn't worth arresting the witcher for. As Geralt prepared to leave, he threatened Falwick, saying if he ever threatened Nenneke or Cranmer again, he would die for it.
The two headed back to the temple, where he prepared to travel, packing up his horse and saying his goodbyes. Iola came out and gave him his elixirs and after their hands touched, she started to suffer a seizure, which Nenneke told Geralt to ignore and leave, which he did.
Dragon hunt.

Aedd Gynvael.
A while later, Geralt and Yennefer traveled to the city of Aedd Gynvael in Narok, and during their stay in the city, Geralt took on a contract on a nasty zeugl that had infested the sewers. While fighting the beast, he got stuck in a rubbish heap and was dragged through the filth, and after striking the killing blow, the beast's slime and bile spilled all over the witcher, adding to his stench.
After returning to the inn they were staying at, Yennefer made a deal of Geralt's smell and instantly made him bathe in seawater, while they discussed his fight with the zeugl. They then discussed the mage Istredd, a topic of jealousy for Geralt, and after discussing their plans in the city, they made love.
Meeting Triss.
At some point, Geralt met the young sorceress Triss Merigold, a close friend of Yennefer's during their on-again-off again relationship. After a recent breakup, when Geralt was left feeling vulnerable and wanted to forget about her, Triss used a little bit of magic to seduce the witcher and the two began a short-lived relationship. However, after some time, Geralt chose to end the relationship out of guilt. The separation was difficult for Triss as she had fallen deeply in love with him. Despite this, the two remained good friends even though Triss was still unhappily in love with him, he did not wish to start anew.
Law of Surprise.

Meeting Ciri.
In 1263, Geralt travelled to the Brokilon forest where he happened across a young princess named Ciri, although Geralt was unaware of who she truly was. The dryads wished to keep her and attempt to turn her into one of their own, however, the Waters of Oblivion failed in her case. Geralt and Ciri managed to leave the forest together and he sent her back to her grandmother, Queen Calanthe. However, Geralt had already begun to feel bound to her.
Training Ciri at Kaer Morhen.
In early 1265, after escaping the forests, Geralt and Ciri rode north to the safety of Kaer Morhen. After tying up Roach, and introducing Ciri to Eskel, Geralt went into the keep with the two and caught up with Lambert, Coën, and Vesemir, where they all agreed to start training the young girl.
In December, after spending a while training Ciri, mainly in the ways of combat, Geralt called for Triss Merigold to help her, as Ciri was displaying signs of a high magical aura. After Triss spent time with Ciri, she became disgusted at the bruises and welts all over her body from training, as well as the witcher's ignorance to her first period, which she had been told earlier in life not to tell men about. One night, while all in the keep had dinner and White Seagull, Triss sent Ciri into a trance, in an attempt to reveal what was causing the constant trances, against the wishes of Geralt, and ended up passing out. The next morning, she woke in the bed with Geralt and recommended they take Ciri to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander on the first day of spring, and seek out Yennefer's help in training her.
One night in the middle of February 1266 though, Geralt and the witchers were conversing with Triss in regards to their indifference to politics and went into detail about what happened during the Battle of Sodden Hill. Ciri ran into the room, proclaiming she'd stand by Triss in fighting the Nilfgaardians as they'd killed her grandmother; Ciri revealed she thought she was training to kill, as she wanted to kill the winged helmet knight that haunted her dreams. Geralt sharply chastised her, informing her they were training her to save lives, not to kill out of fear and hatred, before sending her out of the room.
Distraught, Ciri ran out into the courtyard and stopped on the ledge of one of the walls where she inspected her sword. As Geralt and Triss approached, she cried out that nobody was going to take her sword from her, but as she moved, she lost her footing and almost fell to her death but Geralt caught her in the nick of time. After speaking comforting words to Ciri, the three agreed it was time to head south to the temple in Ellander.
Road to the temple.
After they left the keep, Triss, Geralt, and Ciri travelled south through Kaedwen, passing over the Gwenllech and Buina rivers, and eventually passing the capital, Ard Carraigh. Along the way, Triss grew quite ill in her saddle and was unable to travel for longer periods than an hour or two at a time, with her condition steadily getting worse.
Eventually, the three came across a fortress and bridge that had been recently attacked by Scoia'tael, and met with the Kaedwenian sergeant Unist stationed there. The man offered Triss a bed, hoping if she felt better, she may be able to magically heal his soldiers, while Geralt spoke of the Scoia'tael with Unist and a knight. They told him he would not find help at the fort, and to head south over the river and find a caravan in the woods that might have supplies. In the night Geralt came to the caravan and found Yarpen Zigrin and his company, who helped Triss by giving her garlic-salt bread, which he considered medicine. Geralt asked if they could join the company on the ten-day march south to the Lixela, as Triss could rest on the dwarves' cart. After Yarpen discussed it with Vilfrid Wenck, they agreed to start going south with the three.
Over several days of travel, Triss' sickness didn't get better and at one point they were stopped by a Dun Banner patrol, led by Zyvik, who warned them of Scoia'tael in the woods. One afternoon Ciri decided to run off ahead, followed by Geralt. He found her hiding in the bushes, spotting a Scoia'tael warrior across a ravine. He decided they should not tell the group, as to remain neutral, and leave with Ciri the next morning. While walking back, they passed through Shaerrawedd, an ancient elven palace, and Geralt told Ciri the story of Aelirenn. Suddenly Ciri sensed the group was in danger, so they galloped back to find the Scoia'tael attacking the company. After a short fight, and the deaths of Yannick Brass and Paulie Dahlberg, another Dun Banner patrol rode in and slaughtered the elves. Vilfrid had been stabbed in the skirmish, and so died on the ground in front of Geralt. The patrol revealed orders had forced the company into a trap, set up by Henselt to test the dwarves' loyalty to the Scoia'tael. After that, the company kept heading south and Triss, Geralt, and Ciri eventually reached the temple with no further issues.
Guarding the barge.
In 1266, while Ciri was training at the Temple of Melitele in Ellander, Geralt left to look for work and took on a contract issued by the Malatius and Grock Company to guard the barge passing on the Pontar Delta between Foam and Novigrad, in an attempt to lure out the mage Rience. On six different occasions, the trip went successfully, until one day when he was talking to a young boy Everett. After finishing his conversation he met Linus Pitt, a tutor at the Oxenfurt Academy, and they discussed the local wildlife. As the boat neared the banks of Oxenfurt, Temerian guards on the shore called out for the arrest of Geralt for harboring Ciri, as Rience had put out a reward for their capture. Olsen stated Ciri was not aboard and lied about Geralt, telling the guards he was bound for trial in Oxenfurt. One of the guards swiftly grabbed Everett and held a cutlass to his throat, bargaining the young boy's life for Geralt's, who called out his surrender. As he went to leave the barge, the whole group was attacked by an aeschna, which started slaughtering the guards. After saving Everett from the creature, Geralt boarded the barge and watched the remaining guards die to arrowfire from the barge or be eaten by the creature. The barge then set sail to continue to Oxenfurt, where Geralt departed.
Dealing with Rience.
In 1267, after arriving in Oxenfurt and meeting up with Dandelion, Geralt took shelter in the attic of Wolfgang Amadeus Goatbeard, a brewer friend of Dandelion's. After the young medical student Shani delivered a message to the witcher from Dandelion, she had sex with him in the attic bed, which was later interrupted by the bard visiting the attic himself. Dandelion explained Sigismund Dijkstra wasn't as interested in Verden, Rience, or Geralt, his true intentions lay with Ciri's location. Realizing their danger, Geralt prepared to depart at once, and as they went to climb through the attic window, Philippa Eilhart flew down in owl form to the roof, and after being revealed, polymorphed into her true form. They all started a discussion revealing to Geralt it was King Vizimir II who had ordered Dijkstra to find Ciri, and that she held great importance, with the Council of Wizards, Dijkstra, Vizimir, the Temerians, and Rience all hunting her. With that, Shani asked if Rience had a burn on his face, and after confirmation, revealed she knew him and where he was. With everyone looking at her in wonderment, Shani explained that tuition was too costly for her stepfather to cover all of it so she'd been stealing supplies from the school and selling on the side to a local named Myhrman. One day when conducting such business, Myhrman had been entertaining a guest he called "Master Rience" with a burn mark on his face and who'd made unwanted advances at Shani before Myhrman told him to cut it out, as he still wanted to do business with the medical student. With this new information, the group asked Shani to take them to the local, who was now Geralt's best lead in finding Rience.
That night they went to Myhrman's fortified house in the docks, and Shani drew him out pretending to be alone. After Myhrman let down the drawbridge, Geralt appeared from the shadows and punched him in the side of the head, rendering him unconscious and able to be tied up for interrogation. The witcher and Shani told him they knew about his relations with Rience, but Philippa grew tired of the merchant's deceit and started to torture him for information. Through his screams, Geralt obtained the location of a magic amulet he used to summon Rience.
As dawn approached, Geralt wandered the streets of Oxenfurt, having used the amulet and swallowed a witcher potion in preparation for finding Rience. He reached an alleyway near Myhrman's house where he heard four men, and then saw Rience walk into the light. After a quick conversion, the four men, the Michelet brothers, came out of the alleyway and attacked Geralt. With the use of pirouettes and speed, the witcher fought off the constant attacks, and killed them one-by-one, noticing Rience retreat back into the alley. As Rience continued to flee, Geralt ran after him and just stopped the mage's escape by portal, knocking him down. As the two began to fistfight, Rience grew weary and as Geralt went to stab him, Philippa appeared and held the witcher magically down, allowing Rience to escape through the portal. While Philippa claimed to have not betrayed them, that she had much larger plans for Rience, Geralt told her that every day he lived was a day she was supporting death.
Hirundum.
In June, after Rience escaped his grasp, Geralt and Dandelion returned to Temeria and the witcher completed a contract on a fogler near Carreras, and a werewolf near Burdorff, rewarding him 50 crowns a contract. He was later asked by villagers to help them with a different monster problem. After a quick assessment, Geralt deduced it was an uncommon great manticore, and demanded 200 crowns for the contract. The townsman considered this too high a price, but the witcher made clear the danger leaving the manticore would entail, and so before he could back out, the merchants paid up. After quickly taking out his sword, Geralt slew the beast, with quick strokes and signs, much to the townspeoples' surprise and awe. He then took his lower payment of 150 crowns and rode from the crossroads to the local town Dorian for night's rest.
In the morning, he visited the offices of Codringher and Fenn, a lawyer duo Geralt knew. At first, Codringher provided information about Rience at the price of 250 crowns, and then introduced Geralt to Jacob Fenn, who had been studying the implications the rulers and Rience searching for Ciri held, and the origins of her father. Before leaving the offices, Codringher also suggested Geralt and Ciri hide away in Kaer Morhen, and provide a false Ciri in her place, though the witcher objected. Taking an 100 crown loan out, Geralt prepared to leave for Anchor, as the detective had also heard news of three assassins chasing Yennefer and Ciri along the road to the town. In Anchor, at the local inn, he met the messenger Aplegatt and told him to hide as he knew the assassins were near. Eventually, Ralf Blunden, Little Yaxa, and Heimo Kantor, the three assassins, were confronted and killed by Geralt outside the inn.
A few days later, he and Dandelion went to the village of Little Marsh, and then onto Hirundum, the Hofmeier family farm. Geralt's old friend Bernie had posted a notice for a witcher to investigate the recent drowning of a young boy in one of the farm's ponds, and Geralt knew it would be an opportune location to stay close to Thanedd Island where Ciri was to study. One stormy night, as he returned from a quick investigation, Ciri arrived at the farm on horseback, with Yennefer chasing via portal. Their first meeting in years, Geralt and the sorceress spent the following morning discussing her plans for all four of them to attend the Grand Mage's Conclave on Thanedd.
Thanedd coup.
The following day, on the 30th, they rode to Thanedd, specifically to the palace Loxia, where they attended the reception and met everybody. Come evening, Geralt and Yennefer went with the other mages to Aretuza, and while Yennefer met up with friends, Geralt spoke to Sabrina Glevissig, Triss, Keira Metz, Philippa Eilhart, Dijsktra, Dorregaray and Marti Södergren throughout the banquet. Finally, he was approached by Vilgefortz and Lydia van Bredevoort, who took him on a tour of the Gallery of Glory, and after Lydia left, Vilfefortz offered a truce; join the traitors and live free, though Geralt refused. After returning to the banquet, Geralt and Yennefer said their goodnights and went to bed.
In the early hours of the morning, Geralt awoke and began walking through the garden, only to sense magic and the sounds of battle. He discovered several Redanian soldiers led by Dijkstra, who arrested him in case he defended the Nilfgaardian traitors while Keira arrested Artaud Terranova. She used a spell to temporarily blind the witcher, and he was led to Philippa, who was leading the Northern allies. Though later, after sending the traitors to Garstang to face trial, she restored his eyesight. Geralt was escorted by Dijkstra, who revealed he planned to capture Ciri and use her as a pawn for King Vizimir. Geralt fought off Dijkstra and his guards and Dandelion arrived to inform him that Ciri was gone. As Geralt made his way through Garstang, he could hear sounds and see signs of a battle occurring and encountered a few mages who told him that the magical barrier around the island had been lowered, and rival mages were attacking one another, along with Scoia'tael aligned with Nilfgaard. In the chaos, he found Ciri, who was in the grasp of the mage, Artaud Terranova, but he was attacked by Philippa and Geralt decapitated the mage, rescuing Ciri. He got her on horseback to flee, but she was pursued by Cahir, with Scoia'tael. He followed behind, killing the elves and seeing Cahir already helpless after fighting Ciri, who had fled prior. Geralt asked why he should spare him, and the knight told Geralt he rescued Ciri from the Slaughter of Cintra, and Geralt chose to leave the knight alive. Geralt soon found himself confronting Vilgefortz, and the mage easily beat Geralt down, nearly killing him, but choosing the spare the witcher. Geralt was found by Triss who tried to help him but was weak from the fighting. Tissaia chose to help Triss, teleporting Triss and Geralt away from the island.
Healing in Brokilon.
Triss brought the witcher to the healing spa Col Serrai in Brokilon to recover from his injuries, and left him to heal. By August, Geralt was visited by Dandelion, who updated him of the events of the war, and so the two decided to travel to Brugge, where the bard had heard rumours mentioning the girl. Before leaving though, after 36 days in the forest, Geralt saw Milva who told him of the news of Ciri being in Nilfgaard (not knowing that it was a false Cirilla), and that the emperor may be planning to marry her. Upon hearing this, the witcher decided to head for Nilfgaard.
On the road.
Geralt and Dandelion began their journey south following the Ribbon river to the Ceann Treise falls, where they planned their march to Verden, and then further onto Cintra along the Yaruga. As they set off and a heavy storm hit, they were surprised by two havekars, Kolda and his boss, though were quickly let go due to the traders mistaking the pair for elves because of their Brokilonian clothes. As they went to leave, however, Imperial agents arrived to grab the havekar's tied-up prisoner: Cahir aep Ceallach. While first furious at the belief the traders had killed Cahir, due to him being tied up in a coffin, the meeting then turned into a mutiny when the Imperials attacked their so-called "allies". Milva then arrived, having been following Geralt's trail, and helped the witcher kill the remaining Imperials. Spotting the coffin again, the group opened it and untied Cahir, and upon Geralt's first unveiling and near-distain of the Vicovarian, they ambivalently decided to spare only his life, untie him, and leave him there to fend for himself, being the second time the knight received mercy from the witcher, though he was warned of his doom should they meet again.
Despite Geralt's warning, Cahir took off after the group, though he never directly approached them. It was only several days later when the group, fed up with knowing someone was following them but not sure who, confronted them only to find Cahir once again in their presence. As Geralt demanded Cahir fight him, the knight stated he didn't wish to fight but to join them in rescuing Ciri. Geralt strongly objected to this, threatening to kill him once more but Cahir, unwillingly to pull out his weapon like Geralt demanded, reiterated that he didn't want to fight, leaving the two in a stalemate. Only when Milva stated she could put an arrow in his horse to prevent Cahir from catching up with them as they continued on did Cahir mount and run off.
Eventually, while travelling through the forest, they came across the dwarf Zoltan Chivay and his company. The dwarves told them of their plan to travel to the Turlough Hills, then the Old Road to the river Chotla in Sodden, before continuing onto the Ina. Zoltan, after hearing of the three wanderers journey south toward enemy clutches, invited them to join the dwarves on their march east, which was accepted.
Looking for the druids.
Choosing to follow Regis's advice, Geralt and his company made their route to get to the druids of Caed Dhu, in hopes that they could help him locate Ciri. The company commandeered a ferry to cross the Yaruga, but as they crossed, they found themselves in the middle of two opposing forces of the Lyrian and Nilfgaardian armies. While fleeing both forces, the ferry landed on the bridge connecting the two shores. Milva was struck by an arrow, miscarrying and Regis had to tend to her, so Geralt and Cahir needed to protect their friend and decided to take up arms against the Nilfgaardians, both fighting the forces and inspiring the Lyrians to combat the foe, defeating the enemy. Despite his lack of interest in political matters, Geralt was brought to Queen Meve, who knighted him, properly granting him the title of Geralt of Rivia for his role in the battle.

Riding with the Wild Hunt.
After Ciri departed to inhabit another world, Geralt and Yennefer lived together peacefully in a house with an orchard on the Island of Avallach and the couple stopped counting time. Tragically the Wild Hunt eventually discovered them, burning down their island and kidnapped Yennefer. Geralt returned to reality and set out on The Path. Over several months, Geralt travelled throughout the Northern Realms in order to find and rescue Yennefer.
On September 13, 1269, Geralt crossed The Ravine of the Hydra where he saw the elven corpses of the 53 Vrihedd Brigade officers who had been executed and dropped into the chasm. In November, 23, He journeyed to Cintra, the village of Coldwater, where he witnessed a victim of The Hunt's wrath, an eleven-year-old boy. On February 24, 1270, Geralt climbed through a high pass in the Armush Mountains and faced off against an imperial manticore. He defeated the old and deadly beast whose pelt helped him to survive the harsh winter conditions. On May 30, 1270, In The Yaruga River, Geralt learned that The Wild Hunt continued their pursuit down south and had taken twenty-three individuals under their command.
On July 25, 1270, in the forests of Angren, Geralt encountered a witcher named Letho who had been mortally wounded by a slyzard and saved him. Grateful for his help, Letho informed him about The Wild Hunt 's location and offered his assistance to find them and was accompnaied by his companions Serrit and Auckes. The group eventually reached up to them on the Winter Solstice, at the Hanged Man's Tree in Nilfgaard. The Witchers fought valiantly against the spectral riders, however despite their combined skill they were outnumbered and unable to defeat them all. Ultimately a stalemate ensued and a deal was made between Geralt and their leader Eredin. He offered his soul in exchange for Yennefer's, Eredin agreed to his terms and released her.
Geralt rode with the Red Riders for an unspecified amount of time. He was eventually released from the Wild Hunt's grip by Ciri who sensed that he was in danger and deposited him in the woods outside of Kaer Morhen. This event caused Geralt to suffer from amnesia and was left with no recollection of his time with The Wild Hunt.
Recovered memories.
Six months after the events of Loc Muinne, Geralt having finally recovered his memory, set out on the trail to find Yennefer. He decided to split up from Triss, for reasons unknown and the two went their separate ways. Geralt later reunited with his mentor Vesemir who offered his aid in finding Yennefer. Once the pair hunted down a fiend named Drugan in Vorune.

Dealing with the griffin.
In May 1272, Geralt and Vesemir were headed to the village of Willoughby, following the instructions of a recent letter from Yennefer, who they were trying to meet up with. However, having heard Willoughby had been burned to the ground, they instead stopped in White Orchard. In Geralt's search for more information on Yennefer's whereabouts, it eventually led to the two witchers taking on a contract to kill a local griffin in the area. After killing it and learning the sorceress was in Vizima, the two prepared to leave White Orchard but got into a fight in the inn and ran into no other than Yennefer herself as they left the building, complete with a Nilfgaardian escort. The sorceress explained that Emperor Emhyr var Emreis had summoned Geralt to Vizima, and that he needed to come with her back to the palace. Saying his goodbyes to Vesemir, Geralt then rode off with the group but soon after the Wild Hunt attacked the group, with only Geralt and Yennefer managing to escape thanks to Yennefer's magic.
Searching for Ciri.
Following the attack from the Wild Hunt, Geralt and Yennefer arrived in Vizima. The witcher met with the emperor, who tasked him with finding Ciri, as she was needed for reasons of state, and the witcher would be well compensated. Accepting the job, he conversed with Yennefer about possible leads. She told him about one of the emperor's spies named Hendrik, who lived around the Inn at the Crossroads in Velen, who she thought might possibly know Ciri's whereabouts. With no time to waste, the two said their farewells and Geralt rode off to Velen.
Geralt eventually found out that Hendrik was living in Heatherton but found out too late: the Wild Hunt had arrived earlier and tortured Hendrik for information but finally killed the spy after he wouldn't give them anything. Fortunately, Geralt managed to find the spy's hidden room with notes on possible leads where Ciri was seen, including quarreling with a witch in Midcopse and in the company of a local called the Bloody Baron at Crow's Perch.
Close to the town of Midcopse, Geralt met with Keira Metz, believing she may have been the witch that Ciri had quarrelled with. She knew nothing of Ciri's whereabouts, but suggested the two meet with an elven sage in the underground ruins near Byways, who had met Ciri recently. After arriving, they found that the Wild Hunt had beaten them there, which resulted in Geralt and Keira battling Nithral, a general of the Hunt. They found nothing but morphotic projections left for Ciri, mentioning the Witches of Crookback Bog, an ancient threat that Keira explained to Geralt, who was now determined to find them.
Geralt then visited nearby Crow's Perch, and visited the Bloody Baron, who explained his meeting with Ciri and promised more information if he could track down his wife Anna, and daughter Tamara, who were both missing. In Anna's room, Geralt found evidence of a fight and stench of wine, which led him to a saffron filled talisman under the floorboards. He tracked the smell of saffron to the basement and found Tamara had constructed a shrine to the Eternal Fire. With enough evidence, he confronted the baron about the signs of fighting, which he was clueless to due to his drinking. Phillip suggested the witcher visit the Pellar at his hut near Blackbough. At the Pellar's hut, Geralt was tasked with tracking down Princess, the Pellar's goat, as she was needed for a ceremony that could help find Anna and Tamara. After finding the goat and performing the ceremony, the Pellar told Geralt to either lift the curse on a botchling or kill it and take its blood.
Lifting the botchling's curse led Geralt to the fisherman Voytek at his hut near Crow's Perch. Voytek told Geralt his part of Anna and Tamara's story, explaining the same as Keira, that his answer may lie in Crookback Bog. Geralt also travelled to Oxenfurt, where he met Tamara, who was alive and well at Voytek's brothers house. With all this information, the witcher returned to the Bloody Baron, who explained some of the times Ciri and him had spent together near the keep. He told the witcher to find his wife and then he would finish his story.
In Crookback Bog, Geralt followed the "Trail of Treats" until he came upon an orphanage. He found Gran, an old woman who was running the orphanage, and a group of kids that led him to Johnny, a godling who had lost his voice. After Geralt helped Johnny reclaim his voice, the godling helped him convince Gran to summon the Witches of Crookback Bog. The witches instructed Geralt to travel to Downwarren and meet the ealdorman there. In Downwarren, the ealdorman asked Geralt to clear an ancient threat at the Ancient Oak nearby.
At the Ancient Oak, Geralt heard whispers around a cave, which led him to the The Ghost in the Tree. The spirit wished Geralt to release her from the captivity of the oak.
After finishing the contract, the ealdorman gave Geralt payment and so the witcher headed back into Crookback Bog. The crones poloymorphed and told Geralt of how they had found Ciri near the orphanage, and attempted to eat her before she escaped into the bog. Gran then revealed herself as Anna Strenger, driven crazy by her husband and the bog, now in servitude to the crones.
Back at Crow's Perch, the baron took news of his wife hard and asked the witcher to venture back into the swamp to rescue her with him. He also fulfilled his promise to tell Geralt of where Ciri had gone; toward Novigrad as she was being pursued by the Wild Hunt.
Business in Ofir.
In 1273, Geralt was in Novigrad after being seriously injured on a contract. He got into a brawl with a racist, which was promptly broken up by Master van Schagen, a Redanian man requesting help with a job. He told the witcher of a man creeping into his daughter's room, meanwhile bypassing the guards and remaining silent and unseen. Accepting the contract, the two left for Van Schagen residence to investigate.
That night, Geralt discovered the "ghost" meeting Celia van Schagen was non-other than Dandelion, who was currently courting the young lady. Confronting him, Dandelion revealed he had ended his relationship with Priscilla, and was showing Celia a magic trunk he had won in Oxenfurt. Despites Geralt's warnings, Dandelion read aloud the glowing runes written on the trunk, capturing the two of them and flying them to Ofir.
Upon arrival, the two left the tower they had landed on top of, and were instantly surrounded by Ofiri guards. They were arrested and taken before Malliq Nibras, the leader of Ofir, and played innocent with Geralt taking the name of Lambert. Nibras told "Lambert" he must travel to the north, and kill Geralt of Rivia, the witcher that had slayed his son Sirvat; until this job was completed he would keep Dandelion at the palace as a "guest". That evening, Geralt met with Radeyah, the crown sorceress who knew his true identity, despite their trickery. She told him about her reviving the maliq's wife Zaira, and about the murders that had followed of the concubines of the maliq.
The next morning, Geralt and Radeyah attacked Zaira in the palace gardens, knocking her unconscious. After discovering that she radiated a strong magically aura, they left as Maraal, the crown assassin had arrived. He confronted Geralt outside the city gates, and the two fought, with Maraal blind with fury that they had attacked Zaira. Geralt taunted him about a possible secret relationship, and then drove his sword through the assassin's chest.
The sorceress and witcher met in private, discussing the battle, when suddenly they heard a scream outside. Dayo, one of the maliq's concubines, had been killed by a djinn. Hours later, they met again in a cave outside the city, where Geralt fought off Falaks in order to collect sewant mushrooms. They discussed Yennefer before being attacked again, this time by a large insectoid creature.
They next went to the dead mage Aamad's workshop to create Archeus' salt, a substance handy for fighting djinns. Geralt left to find Zaira, who was in the throne room, possessing Nibras. The witcher and sorceress clashed, until Geralt managed to slay her with his sword. He was arrested by the guards, and thrown into jail for her murder. The next day he faced trial, where Nibras sentenced him to be flayed alive. Dandelion defended the witcher, but suggested instead that he be locked in a trunk and thrown in the sea. Standing on the cliff's edge the next day, Geralt was thrown into the sea but activated the magical runes in order to escape drowning.
The next night, Geralt confronted Nemet, the city coroner about where he buried bodies. They found the hole, where Zaira was lying a week deceased, before being attacked by giant crows. Following the battle, Geralt realized they had torn Nemet to pieces, so he left towards the palace alone. He met with Fathaa, who explained the curse and runes better. Before leaving Ofir, the witcher met one last time with Radeyah, revealing that he knew her entire plan to frame Geralt after cursing Zaira. Instead of killing her however, he sent her in a magic trunk to Yennefer. The witcher then left Ofir with Dandelion, boarding a ship at the docks.
Personality.
Most of the time, he could be apathetic, cynical, and threatening. Despite his outwardly cold nature, Dandelion noted that behind his exterior was hiding a fiercely loyal friend, and a man of good humour and as someone not indifferent to suffering. Geralt had many good friends all over the Northern Realms, such as Caldemeyn of Blaviken, Zoltan Chivay, and of course Dandelion. He was also very protective of and loyal to his friends and companions, and was willing to go to great lengths for those who mattered to him. He could be kind-hearted and caring to the people he loved.
Geralt was also shown to be extremely adept at allaying intense, and at times bleak, situations and as a man who would much sooner have everyone return home than draw their swords. His lifespan made him a world-weary man, often expressing disdain and circuitous insults to those he considered cruel, foolish, etc. He may have risked Temeria's future to save Triss Merigold from the Nilfgaardians. He also was shown requesting Scoia'tael to spare Dandelion and kill only him.
Geralt frequently showed remorse and had revelations in his life. Other times he had complete emotional breakdowns, even giving up being a witcher in general and dropping his morals at one point.
Legacy.
The story of Geralt and Ciri became a popular saga many years, probably centuries, after the actual events had taken place. The chief sources of these stories were Dandelion's ballads and the bard's autobiography "Half a Century of Poetry". However, Dandelion was not fond of telling the whole truth, and ultimately many versions of Geralt's and Ciri's adventures were spread far and wide, including simplified and harmless children's tales, leading scholars to struggle in distinguishing those stories that were considered canon from those that seemed non-canonical and embellished.
Many years in the future, the sorceress Nimue verch Wledyr ap Gwyn and her assistant Condwiramurs Tilly conducted extensive research into the matter, in an attempt to determine what had really happened to Geralt and Ciri.

Prologue.
After seemingly having been killed by a mob during a pogrom of nonhumans at the end of the Witcher saga, Geralt returns to life with no recollection of the details of his sudden reappearance or of the five intervening years. He is rescued by the last remaining witchers in the world and is taken back to Kaer Morhen. There, he is drawn into a complicated conspiracy concerning the witchers, their secrets, and the nefarious forces that are after that knowledge.
Shortly after Geralt's return to Kaer Morhen, an attack is launched on the fortress by an unknown organization, spearheaded by two mages. Though one mage is unknown to her, Triss recognizes the other as Savolla. Geralt provides assistance to his friends in repelling the attack, before Vesemir proclaims that the party must split up as the two mages, having unleashed a frightener in the main courtyard, have descended into the witchers' laboratory to procure the secrets they are in pursuit of. Vesemir offers Geralt the choice of either going after the mages with Triss, or staying to assist the other witchers in defeating the frightener.
Later, Leo and Geralt find Triss in an injured state, and descend to the laboratory in order to stop the mages from absconding with the secret formulae. When confronted with the witchers, one of the attackers, namely, The Professor, kills Leo with a crossbow bolt before teleporting away, along with the mages and a sizeable portion of the witchers' writings.
During Leo's funeral, Vesemir decides that the attackers, known as Salamandra, must be tracked down and forced to pay for their transgressions. He tells Geralt to use Temeria as a starting point in his search, as he once lifted a curse there from Foltest's daughter.
Geralt pursues the mysterious Salamandra, and in the process meets many people from his past, as well as new acquaintances who either require the witcher's help or offer their own in his quest to regain his identity.
Chapter I.
Vizima is under quarantine due to the Catriona plague, and Geralt cannot enter it as he lacks the necessary letter of safe conduct. Thus, he settles in Vizima's outskirts. During the night, Geralt is attacked by spectral hounds, known as barghests, which were in pursuit of a woman and child. The witcher manages to rescue a boy named Alvin, who levitates and recites Ithlinne's Prophecy in a disturbing voice after the attack, revealing himself to be a Source. Shortly thereafter, Geralt meets Shani, a red-haired medic hailing from Oxenfurt who arrived here to help quell the Catriona epidemic. She decides to place the now-orphaned Alvin under her care. Geralt also meets the alchemist Kalkstein, a trader named Declan Leuvaarden, and Zoltan Chivay, an old friend from Geralt's past life.
Geralt seeks out the Reverend, who agrees to assist him in obtaining passage to the city if he fulfils the contract on The Beast, a certain entity which is thought to be responsible for the barghests. The Reverend sends Geralt to assist three pillars of the community: Odo, Mikul, and Haren Brogg.
The trader Odo tasks Geralt with weeding out the echinops in his garden after a session of heavy drinking. Mikul sends the witcher to clear the local crypt of ghouls, wherein Geralt discovers the corpse of a poisoned woman. Haren Brogg tasks Geralt with driving away the drowners from his goods by the riverbank. It becomes apparent, however, that Haren is actually a hawker, after a regiment of Scoia'tael attempts to take away the goods Geralt was tasked to protect.
The Reverend then offers Geralt to deal with Abigail, a local witch, to whom Shani has now transferred her responsibility over Alvin. The witch carries out a magical procedure in which she attempts to communicate with the spirit of the White Frost in Alvin awakened by the Beast. It confers that the Beast's appearance was caused by the sins of the local residents.
Geralt returns to the Inn, wherein he discovers a group of Salamandra fighters assaulting Shani. After dealing with them, the witcher pursues the other members of the Salamandra. Upon reaching their cavernous lair, Geralt discovers Alvin inside who was taken from Abigail's home and turned over to the group by the Reverend and his followers. Further along the cave system, Geralt and Alvin meet Abigail, who asks for the witcher's help in fleeing the enraged crowd that has amassed outside. Geralt makes a choice, either to save Abigail from being lynched, or to leave her to the judgment of the Outskirts' residents. After deciding, he defeats the Beast and the barghests.
Later, after receiving a pass into Vizima from the Reverend, or taking it from his corpse, Geralt returns to the Inn, and travels to the city with Shani. However, he is stopped by Mikul at the gates and is turned over to the city guard.
 "A book entitled "The Rivian Pogrom" claims that Geralt, known also as the White Wolf, died during a massacre of non-humans. The pogrom took place in the city of Rivia just after the second war with Nilfgaard. Geralt was killed by an angry mob when he tried to defend the oppressed. The sorceress Triss Merigold and the dwarf Zoltan Chivay witnessed his death. The witcher's body was never found."
 "The bard Dandelion recounts the adventures of the witcher Geralt in his ballads. After reading them, one may conclude that the White Wolf was the most famous witcher of his time. He actively participated in many historical events, such as the mage rebellion on Thanedd Island. Dandelion's poems are mostly devoted to Geralt's fights against monsters, the numerous romantic entanglements for which he is famous, and to his love for a certain sorceress."
 "Some years ago, Geralt of Rivia came to King Foltest's court in search of work. He obtained a contract to free the monarch's daughter Adda from a spell which had turned her into a striga, or to kill her if all else failed. The witcher managed to free the girl from the spell, and discovered that one of the courtiers had been responsible for the curse."
 "Behold our hero: subjected to mutations and rigorous sword and sorcery training as a child, he has become a superhuman monster slayer. Always penniless and often disdained by those whom he protects, he wanders the world seeking work. Fate has little mercy for him, piling obstacles in his way, yet he trudges on. He has more scruples than a beggaring bum has fleas. Doubts haunt him even when a band of ruffians, knives drawn, approaches him on the highway. Is he a good man? I do not think so. Does he try to maintain his humanity? I believe he does."
 "You must know that Geralt of Rivia died once already, or at least everyone thought him dead. During a massacre in Rivia, he sought to defend nonhumans and fell to overwhelming odds. Placed in a boat, he floated into the mist, into a realm where he finally found peace, but not for long. Because of forces mentioned later, Geralt returned just in time to defend the witchers' ancient home fortress, and then embarked on a mission to recover the secrets stolen from it. Along the way he took part in a Scoia'tael uprising, shattered a powerful criminal organization, and killed the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose. All the while his fame as a lover grew. Well, that's Geralt for you. As if all this wasn't enough, he then foiled the attempted assassination of King Foltest of Temeria and became one of the monarch's most trusted men."
Journal entry.
The third installment of the trilogy, like its predecessors, follows Geralt through his final adventures. Following the events of Witcher 2, Geralt has regained his memory of the past and prepares to embark on a new journey. In the Witcher 3, Geralt is on the hunt for the only person he considers kin, Ciri. Along his journey, Geralt must face the Wild Hunt in order to protect the people he cares about.
In the new open world, Geralt has the opportunity to complete quests that are both part of the main story and side quests. He will also interact with old friends Dandelion and Vesemir along with potential lovers Triss Merigold and Yennefer.
 "Many cannot fathom the friendship Geralt of Rivia and I, Dandelion, have shared all these years. When we first began breaking bread together, spiteful tongues said he'd be better off cutting my throat and dumping my body in a hollow tree – before I provoked someone else into doing that same to us both. Those individuals spoke out of pure jealousy, for Geralt was my dearest friend, a fact which he gave ample evidence of on numerous occasions."
 "I could say a great deal about that world-famous monster hunter, the man known in Elder Speech as Gwynbleidd, or, in our younger (yet no less noble) tongue, as the White Wolf. For Geralt of Rivia is a truly exceptional individual. A brief encounter might tempt one to label him a mere swinger of swords, a simple monster-catcher, a rough-and-tumble practitioner of a dirty trade – but peer closer and you will soon discover he is a man of unplumbed depths, unique views and vast, world-spanning experience."
 "On the surface, he is introverted, tight-lipped, and one might even say gruff, but underneath lies an overflowing sea of goodwill, good humour, and an honest readiness to help his friends, be it with a bit of sound advice or the masterful application of his blade."
 "Setting aside cumbersome false modesty, I can say that I know his story better than any man alive. I was with him through hard times and good, helping with wise advice, warm words and razor wit. As a result, I am a vital part of his story, both in its earlier and present portions. It is thus my duty to continue my chronicle and, for the benefit of future generations, put in writing the next chapter of his deeds and exploits."
"Hearts of Stone" expansion.
Step again into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer. This time travel back to the wilds of Velen and the nooks and alleys of Oxenfurt where he'll try to complete a contract from the mysterious Man of Glass, hired to defeat a ruthless bandit captain and Redanian nobleman, Olgierd von Everec, a man who possesses the power of immortality. Geralt, caught in a thick tangle of deceit, will need all his cunning and strength to solve the mystery and emerge unscathed.
"Blood and Wine" expansion.
As Geralt of Rivia again, travel to a land untainted by war: the Nilfgaardian region of Toussaint, where you will unravel the horrifying secret behind a beast terrorizing the kingdom. With all trails leading to dead ends, only a witcher can solve the mystery and survive the evil lurking in the night as an atmosphere of carefree indulgence and knightly ritual masks an ancient, bloody secret.
"The Witcher Adventure Game".
Geralt is one of the four playable characters in "The Witcher: Adventure Game".
He is called there "MONSTER SLAYER - DEADLY IN COMBAT".
"The Witcher Battle Arena".
Geralt of Rivia was one of playable characters in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins. He was a warrior class hero.
"A witcher, a wandering solution in search of his next problem; a man who's seen as many caves and trolls as he has kings, queens, and courts. In the Arena, Geralt excels as a dueler, but also brings some utility (crowd control support skills) to the table. His first ability (The Way of the Sword) is a three-stage sword attack: Geralt performs a pirouette, then follows it up with two quick slashes. As a witcher, he is also able to wield a simple form of magic called Signs: The Way of Signs enables him to use the Yrden Sign to set a magic trap which slows all opponents in its range. Then there is The Way of Alchemy: after chugging a potion powerful enough to kill one elephant, Geralt gains the strength of three, and his two skills gain new effects: The Way of the Sword now slows enemies, and The Way of Signs now casts the Heliotrope Sign, which not only slows, but also damages opponents."
"Geralt of Rivia—a witcher, a wandering solution in search of his next problem. He is a man who's seen as many caves and trolls as he has kings, queens, and courts. Witchers are mutants, trained from early childhood for one task: to protect the peoples of the Continent from the innumerable foul creatures that inhabit it."
"There are several schools of witchers, represented by the different medallions their members wear around their neck. The wolf medallion Geralt bears warns him of impending danger or nearby magic by gently vibrating. In recent years, the witcher caste has dwindled down to only a handful of active hunters; with so few of them left, the world is beginning to resemble the times before witchers came to be."
"Geralt possesses superhuman reflexes and strength, and his sword fighting skills are second to none. Like every witcher, Geralt fights with two swords: a silver sword, dedicated to combating monsters and creatures of magical origin, and a steel one, primarily used to deal with ferocious animals and the occasional bandit who thinks he can best a master swordsman. Using witcher Signs and special potions, he can tip the scales of any battle in his favor. Being a witcher, Geralt's main occupation is slaying monsters, but he won't hesitate to prove a (usually bloody) point when humans or non-humans try to stand in his way. Geralt strives to maintain his witcher neutrality, but he will sometimes lend a hand to others, even if it drags him into the middle of some mess. Witchers are known for being cold and emotionless due to the mutations they undergo, but Geralt's process must have gone differently, for he is capable of feelings and emotions and a surprising amount of empathy toward others. Living in a world where morality is a concept known mostly to those who aren't hungry, the famous witcher of Rivia remains one of the few beacons of hope...if you have the orens to hire him."

&lt;/infobox&gt;Temeria is one of the northern kingdoms, lying south of the Pontar river. Its neighbors are Redania, Kerack, Kaedwen, Aedirn, Mahakam, Lower Sodden, and Cidaris.
After the first and second wars, Temeria profited the most out of the defeat of Nilfgaard, expanding its borders as far south as Angren and Riverdell, reaching the Amell mountains. But the Kingdom also received a heavy blow regarding its economy, which forced it to buy goods from their southern neighbor.

In 1263, during the First Northern War, King Foltest of Temeria sent the Temerian Army to Lower Sodden, in an attempt to help defend against the invading Nilfgaardians. While the Nilfgaardians were defeated, Temeria received many refugees from nearby Cintra, after its capital was sacked.
After the war, tensions grew with Redania, as well as Nilfgaard, and an influx of cheap Nilfgaardian goods started passing through Temeria, damaging the economy. King Vizimir II of Redania forced Novigrad into "ius stapulae", blocking Temerian and Nilfgaardian goods from entering the city. In response, Foltest issued the law in Vizima and Gors Velen, in an attempt to re-stabilize the economy.
In early 1267, on the brink of a Second Northern War, Foltest issued messages to his lords and vassals, instructing them to collect troops for the army, and to store supplies and fortify their castles, prepared for the possibility of sieges in the coming conflict. By July, after the war's beginning and the fall of Aedirn and Verden, Foltest signed a peace truce with Nilfgaard, knowledgable of the fact Temeria couldn't raise the numbers to support King Demavend, or solely defeat the invading Imperials.
Society.
Temerians are considered very polite and religious, but do not fully accept representatives of the so-called Elder Races. In general Temeria's residents have a tendency for xenophobia, despite nonhumans living in their society.
Culture.
Religion.
The most popular and most widespread religion in the kingdom is the worship of the goddess Melitele, though cults of the Prophet Lebioda and Kreve also have their followers. On Saovine, children burn figurines of Falka, to represent her defeated rebellion.
Economy and trade.
Temeria is one of the wealthiest realms in the North. Temerian economy is based on cultivating the production of various goods, trade, and extracting valuable mineral resources, from the mountains of Mahakam. The Temerian oren is one of the most used currencies in the world. Temeria also remains a land with highly developed agriculture, animal husbandry, and food industry. As Mahakam is officially part of the kingdom, Temeria has considerable interests in the extraction of precious metals and the production of high-quality weapons.
National emblems.
In the kingdom of Temeria's former coat of arms ... there was a lion passant. But the Temerian royal dukes used a different one ... containing three lilies. Since in heraldic symbolism the lily fower is a sign of the successor to the throne, the royal son, the heir to the throne and sceptre ...
And when Prince Goidemar, the son of old King Gardik, went to fight against the insurgents of the she-devil Falka, the Temerian Army, under his standard, under the emblem of the lily, fought and won decisive victories. And when Goidemar inherited the throne from his father, he established three lilies argent on a field sable as the kingdom's coat of arms as a memento of those victories and for the miraculous escape of his wife and children from the hands of the enemy. And later King Cedric changed the state coat of arms by a special decree so that it's a black shield aspersed with silver lilies. And the Temerian coat of arms has been like that ever since.- Jarre,  "The Lady of the Lake"

The prologue is set at Kaer Morhen, which is in Kaedwen, not Temeria, and the following chapters are all set in or around Vizima. You are not free to travel around Temeria as you wish, as the available locations change with each chapter. There is no way to travel large distances to reach other familiar locations in the game world.
Nevertheless, there is a world map in the game, and examining it gives a sneak peek at locations that might come into play in the future.
At the top of the map is Vizima, with the Outskirts southeast of it, Old Vizima to the southwest, and the swamp cemetery and the swamp further to the south. The lakeside is just south of the Black Tern Island, almost in the southwest corner of Lake Vizima.
At the bottom left of the map, a cut-out can be seen which depicts the Northern Kingdoms.
"Temeria's population is not exclusively human. It also includes dwarves, elves, gnomes and dryads. After the devastating war with Nilfgaard, many areas are haunted by monsters, which have hitherto not constituted a serious threat, while the realm's roads are made unsafe by outlaws and common bandits. As a result, the witcher profession is once again in demand, though people continue to treat witchers with caution and disdain, often calling them mutants and freaks."
"The Kingdom of Temeria has silver lilies on a black background as its emblem. This powerful country has gained ever more influence in recent years under the wise rule of King Foltest. Across the Pontar River, the kingdom borders Redania. To the south and east it is hemmed in by mountain ranges, including Mahakam, the mainstay of dwarves and gnomes, past which lie the lands of Lyria and Aedirn. The capital of Temeria is Vizima, lying on the shore of Lake Vizima. The second largest city is Maribor. Temeria mints its own coin — the oren. The most widespread religions are the Cult of Melitele and the belief in the Eternal Fire. Temeria is home to the headquarters and many commandeers of the Order of the Flaming Rose."

There is armor in the second game for Geralt called Temerian armor.
Temeria
"Anyone who wishes to be considered an educated man rather than a common boor should mention Temeria first where the Northern Kingdoms are concerned. The realm's coat of arms is a black shield dotted with silver fleurs-de-lys, and its capital is Vizima, where the Royal Palace erected by King Foltest stands. The country extends its protection to several surrounding domains, including the mountainous dwarven homeland of Mahakam. Currently Temeria's neighbors include the mighty Redania, the wooded Kaedwen, and Cidaris, known for the truly pathetic poetry of Valdo Marx, a troubadour unworthy of the title, for he chiefly devotes himself to besmirching the work of other, superior artists. Two other places in Temeria are essential to our story and thus must be mentioned. Firstly, north of Vizima, near the White Bridge that links the banks of the Pontar, stands the proud fortress and walled town of the La Valette family. Secondly, further up the Pontar lies the small river port and trading post of Flotsam. Both will prove important to the beginning of our story..."

Race

Race typically pertains to civilized, humanoid beings, like humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings, particularly in the Northern Kingdoms. However, this is a rather narrow scope as other intelligent beings exist that may or may not be humanoid, like dryads, unicorns, higher vampires, merpeople, dragons, and trolls. However, because many of these are either considered less intelligent or not human enough to humans, many classify them as beasts or monsters. This classification also pertains to witchers who many perceive as a separate "race" due to their mutations, even though they come from humanoid backgrounds, like human or elf.
Humans and elves are able to interbreed, creating half-elves and quarter-elves. The two races are also used by dryads for procreation purposes to father more dryads.

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Elves are one of the humanoid races that inhabit the Continent. Forming a major part of the Elder Races (along with dwarves and gnomes), those known as "Aen Seidhe" came to the Continent on their white ships much earlier than humans, but later than the other Elder Races. They live much longer than humans and are usually very attractive.
Elves are capable of interbreeding with humans (thus producing half-elves and quarter-elves) and dryads. Though elves are incredibly long lived, only young elves are fertile, thus elven populations tend to reproduce at a slower rate than humans.
Like other nonhumans, elves are often persecuted by Nordlings. Because of that, many elves were members of the Scoia'tael guerrillas allied with Nilfgaard during the empire's second invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. In return, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis gave the elves a state of their own in Dol Blathanna and made Enid an Gleanna its queen.
Elves believe that they were created, unlike humans, who evolved. For this reason, some elves consider humans to be little more than hairless apes. Aside from Aen Seidhe, there exists another group of elves called Aen Elle that inhabits another world.
History.
Elves travelled to the Continent on their white ships approximately two-and-a-half thousand years before the arrival of humans, most likely from another world travelled from by a portal. For a thousand years, the elves colonized much of the Continent, mostly through peaceful means, though they did clash with several races, such as vrans, werebbubbs and dwarves, taking control of the vrani city of Loc Muinne.
By the time of the First Landing and the arrival of humans on the Continent, elves mistook their intentions and underestimated the threat of human colonisation. As they continued to refuse to commit to a human-elven war, fearing thousands of casualties, they chose to keep fleeing to the east, hoping that the invaders would eventually stop expanding. In the process they abandoned many of their own cities. Eventually, a peace treaty was signed amongst the humans and elves, although this was broken just a few years later when Redanian forces, led by Milan Raupenneck, attacked and slaughtered the inhabitants of Loc Muinne. Thus, the elven-human war started, which quickly resulted in an elven defeat and their retreat further east, a blow from which their race has never managed to recover.
Many years later, another peace treaty was signed with the weary elves, which allowed them to live in the mountains without attack from humans, provided they submitted to human rule. This remained their fate for several years, until about two hundred years ago. This fragile peace was broken when Aelirenn led her people, against the wishes of their elders, towards a suicidal battle against the humans. This revolt resulted in the death of Aelirenn and all of her warriors.
In 1263, following the First Northern War, many elves mixed with dwarves to create the Scoia'tael, due to the racial prejudice they faced. In the years following they gained a reputation as violent killers, and many elves who didn't join still aided the cause by providing shelter and food. As the North saw the ferocity of the Scoia'tael, several pogroms exploded throughout the kingdoms up to the Second Northern War in 1267, resulting in the death of thousands of nonhumans, including elves, and so the hate between races grew stronger.
Culture.
The elven culture places an emphasis on naturalism and living in harmony with the land, rather than bending it to one's will. Urban elves tend to be very scholarly or artistic, but can take up a variety of professions just like humans. Rural elves that do not live amongst humans live a somewhat simpler lifestyle, hunting, gathering, and living off the land as needed. In battle, elven warriors favor bows and metal swords, as well as light armor made out of furs and hides. They tend to be skilled at sword fighting from horseback.
Language.
Most elves speak Elder Speech, the traditional language of the Aen Seidhe. Almost all elves have at least a rudimentary familiarity with Common Speech, but many, particularly city dwelling elves speak the common tongue just as well as any other human.
Technology.
It appears many elven clans in the North have a tradition of hunting and gathering, as elves of Dol Blathanna are unfamiliar with agriculture and concepts such as crop rotation. Though many now are destroyed, elves were once capable of making great cities and palaces out of stone, but they did not make castles or fortresses. However, by the time of the 13th century, many of these settlements had long been destroyed or occupied and altered by humans. Elven bows are renowned for their light weight and ease of use, and experienced hunters often favor them over human bows. A style of elven bow known as a "zefhar "is shorter in arc length and formed from a composite of wood and animal sinew. The human hunter Milva claimed that though lighter than human yew bows, zefhars will launch an arrow at a higher velocity and with a reduced spread of accuracy. Their arrows are often fledged with grey feathers, and the shaft fluted for increased stiffness and weight reduction, resulting in almost silent shots. Elven arrowheads complimented, consisting of three-edged razor sharp blades that bored in like a screw, and created major internal damage.
Society.
Elves created magnificent towns and palaces before the arrival of humans to the continent, destroying many of them following conflicts, as they did not wish for elven architecture to fall into the hands of humans. Many modern human cities including Novigrad, Oxenfurt, Vizima, Tretogor, Maribor, Cidaris, and the city of Cintra are built on the ground of destroyed elven cities. Many elves and half elves have managed to integrate into human society but are still faced with prejudice on a day-to-day basis. Others have chosen to live in the wilds in secluded clans, living off the land and avoiding all contact with humans if possible.
Religion.
Elves once, before humans arrived on the Continent, worshipped a deity similiar to Melitele, in that they worshipped a goddess of harvest and fertility.
Characteristics.
Characteristic features of elves include pointed ears and small, identical teeth without cuspids (canine teeth). Elves tend to be very tall and lean, and due to their longevity often appear youthful. Elves are often considered attractive by humans. Like humans, elves choose to wear a variety of different clothing styles, although Scoia'tael are known to favor furs and hides, particularly those of squirrels and other forest dwelling creatures. They also are known to wear make-up, itself being an elven invention.

Elves
"After gnomes, elves are the eldest race on the continent. They created a magnificent civilization and the greatest human cities, like Vizima and Oxenfurt, were built upon elven ruins. Elves also have a special affinity for magic, although their magic is different from that of humans."
"Elves are long-lived, yet the reproductive period of their lives ends quite early and, moreover, they reproduce much more slowly than humans. This is why they were defeated, the reason why they lost their re-eminence in the world. Today, only two enclaves of the race remain: the Blue Mountains, where elves suffer privation and are dying out, and Dol Blathanna, the Valley of the Flowers, which is ruled by the sorceress Enid an Gleanna. The Valley of the Flowers is a dependency of Nifgaard."
"Elves are a beautiful and long-lived race. They have pointed ears, sharp features, and possess no canine teeth. Elves are arrogant and proud, and over many centuries they have developed a high and sophisticated culture. Few remain today, however, and these are in constant conflict with human civilization. That is why so many younger elves, eager to fight for their rights, join Scoia'tael commando units."
"Elves don't discuss their faith in the presence of humans, because they think the barbarians would be unable to grasp its philosophical and mystical subtleties. Most humans, on the other hand, don't care about elven beliefs. It is a fact that some elves believe in Dana Méadbh, the mother goddess, who seems to be an embodiment of the goddess Melitele."
"Humans have their own version of the legend of Lara Dorren and Cragen of Lod, which differs greatly from that of the elves. An elf and a human came together just after the Conjunction of the Spheres and the rise of the human race. The legendary lovers became a symbol of the peaceful co-existence of the two races until some elves, jealous of Lara's attentions, treacherously killed 'the barbarian' who had dared to get involved with their kinswoman. In the human version, Lara is portrayed as a witch. Cregan's death resulted in much treachery and scheming, and thus the hostility which exists today between the races is the elves' fault."
 "The elves tell the story of Lara Dorren and Cregan of Lod, an elven sorceress and a human wizard, as the tale of the legendary lovers who formed the first union between the two races. Elves claim this relationship proved that peaceful co-existence between the races was possible, at least until humans treacherously killed the wizard and banished Lara. Thus, according to the elves, human hostility, possessiveness, and aggression were first demonstrated. These 'barbarian' qualities make co-existence with humans impossible, so the lovers' tragic end triggered a war that continues to this day."
"Elves, or Aen Seidhe, as they call themselves, are a folk known for their beauty and longevity. Their sages, scholars, and artists were at the fore of their fields, creating real, breathtaking masterpieces. The glory of this Elder Race is long gone, however. After a series of bloody conflicts with humans, their cities were ruined, and the elves themselves were forced to retreat to the east, into unapproachable mountains, or to recognize human domination and accept their lot. Years of wars, persecution, and mutual enmity created a rift between our races. Many elves saw a chance of winning freedom in the last war against Nilfgaard, so they took up arms, creating the partisan groups of Scoia'tael. Though they managed to secure the creation of the partially independent realm of Dol Blathanna, some feel they were deceived and still wage war on humans."

"Scroll 1: The Aen Seidhe, the People of the Hills. Traces of their magnificence remain visible to this day. Palace ruins still hidden in dense forests, mysterious towers standing atop mountain peaks, sculptures carved from marble white as fresh snow. But the elves themselves? Their numbers continue to dwindle."
"Scroll 2: Their decline rests in the fact that, although the Aen Seidhe surpass humans in longevity, magical aptitude, and knowledge of the natural world, they are at a disadvantage in one important regard – fertility."
"Scroll 3: Although elves can live for centuries, they can only conceive children during their youngest years. Even then, only one out of every two or three couples will successfully bear a child. Humans, on the other hand – well... They seem to have mastered the process."
"Scroll 4: Consequently, though the elves had at first defeated the humans time and time again, they quickly realized that ultimate victory would prove impossible. For whenever they killed one man, another five stood ready to take his place."
"Chest 1: Many Nordlings believe that the roots of the Nilfgaardian people extend far back to an elven tribe sometimes referred to as the Black Seidhe. This would explain much. After all, their language is derived from Elder Speech, the Empire is far more developed than the North, and they treat non-humans with much less hostility... However, the truth behind such characteristics is rather different. Whereas the people of the south simply chose to adopt some of the elves' best traits, the people of the north opted for slaughter."

Dwarves are one of the humanoid races. Together with gnomes and elves they are called the Elder Races, and along with gnomes they were one of the oldest sentient races on the Continent. Dwarves are often excellent soldiers, artisans and businessmen. While they tend to be uncouth, they are also jolly and cheerful.
The motherland of dwarves is Mahakam. Like other nonhumans, dwarves are often persecuted by Nordlings. Because of that, some dwarves were members of the Scoia'tael guerrilla allied with Nilfgaard during the empire's invasion of the Northern Kingdoms. These dwarves distinguished themselves from their brethren by wearing their beards in plaits.
History.
Dwarves arrived on the Continent between three to four-thousand years before the arrival of humans. The meeting between the dwarves and gnomes was peaceful, as the dwarves had no intention of invading and expanding.
Culture.
Religion.
Dwarves once, before humans arrived on the Continent, worshipped a diety similiar to Melitele, in that they worshipped a goddess of harvest and fertility.
Technology.
Dwarves generally wield axes in battle, though they are known to wield cutlasses, crossbows, bows, and martels (war-hammers).
Their mountain fortifications are unparalleled engineering marvels. Thanks to a system of furnaces, boilers, and reinforced gutters, every passageway into the fortress can change into a deadly trap in the blink of an eye. While mining and moving minerals in their many mines, foundries, forges, and ironworks, large carts are used by the dwarves as transport.
They also create Mahakaman Mix, a highly volatile explosive that is useful during sieges.
Society.
Throughout the expansion of humans from the First Landing, dwarves have integrated into northern society, often peacefully living in large cities, such as Novigrad, or even small villages. As the racial prejudice grew on the Continent, in the years following 1263, many chose to join or aid the the newly created Scoia'tael, mixing with other nonhumans to eventually wipe out the human race. For the violence shown from the Scoia'tael, the human hatred for the dwarves grew stronger, and they often faced persecution for simply existing, in the form of violent pogroms across the North around 1267 onwards.
Characteristics.
Dwarves are short and stocky, generally around the height of a human male's chest. They are more sturdy than humans, which makes them tougher and stronger, a key factor that makes them ruthless in combat. Their endurance also plays a large part; even fully laden dwarves are capable of marching over 30 miles a day. They usually grow long beards, which the women are also fully capable of growing. Once at waist level, generally occurring around the age of 55, dwarves are considered mature.
Female dwarves have a reputation from humans to be extremely unattractive, and are generally only desired by male dwarves, despite the males believing otherwise and being very protective of their wives and daughters.
Andrzej Sapkowski.
"Dwarves," Milva said under her breath. "But they aren't Scoia'tael. They don't have plaited beards."There were six of them, dressed in short, hooded capes, shimmering with countless shades of grey and brown, the kind which were usually worn by dwarves in foul weather. Capes like that, as Geralt knew, had the quality of being totally waterproof, which was achieved by the impregnation of wood tar over many years, not to mention dust from the highway and the remains of greasy food. These practical garments passed from fathers to oldest sons, as a result they were used exclusively by mature dwarves. And a dwarf attains maturity when his beard reaches his waist, which usually occurs at the age of fifty-five. pg. 75, "Baptism of Fire" (U.K. edition)

Glossary Entry.
Dwarves
"Dwarves are shorter than humans, but tougher and more muscular. Male dwarves wear long beards. They are usually gruff but can be merry, and are renowned for their stubbornness. Considered excellent craftsmen and warriors, many have earned grudging acceptance in human society. Still, it is not uncommon for young dwarves to join the Scoia'tael rebels to fight for more rights for non-humans and an end to persecution."
"Dwarves are one of the Elder Races. They were once a dominant race, along with the elves, but now their sole enclave is Mahakam, a mountain-city rich in metal and mineral deposits. Of all the elder races, the dwarves have assimilated best and many now live in human cities. They run businesses and are often wealthy, although they meet with disdain and distrust. During the war with Nifgaard, dwarves made a name for themselves as mercenaries, although many of them also fought in Scoia'tael commando units against the Northern Kingdoms."
Source.
The book From the Annals of Mahakaman History provides a journal entry on dwarves.
"Dwarves are one of the Elder Races. Stocky and bearded, with strongly built bodies and low voices, they are distinguished for their height, which is lower than human. Of simple and direct manners, they are sometimes seen as grumpy, unkind and greedy. I have to stress that my own opinion of the dwarfs is by no means similar to the latter part. I only cite it here to present the views of other people - even if they are dull-minded, hate-blinded buffoons. Mahakam is the dwarves' mountainous homeland, famed for it's numerous mines where precious stones and ores are mined. Many dwarves also live in human cities, for that race usually adapts to new neighbors easily, something that cannot be, unfortunately, said about a large part of humanity. Despite vexations, persecution, and even bloody pogroms, the coexistence with dwarves goes a lot better than with elves. Their flair for trade and craft makes them excellent merchants, bankers, smiths and armorers."

Gnomes are an old and noble race, one of the Elder Races, which came to be the first to populate the northern part of the Continent. They are related to dwarves with whom they peacefully coexist.
In the Northern Kingdoms, many gnomes live in Mahakam alongside dwarves, while the majority of those south of the Yaruga inhabit the Tir Tochair mountain range. Few other gnomish former settlements can be found throughout the realms e.g. the Citadel on Mount Cremora and an abandoned underground town beneath the modern-day Maribor.
They are gifted alchemists, jewelers, smiths, and metallurgists known for making swords of the highest quality.
Culture.
Their society is similar to dwarven clan structures, though apparently less authoritarian, resembling large led by and respected individuals.
Gnomes are reported to be peculiarly hated by kobolds and are in constant state of war with them in some areas. Hearing fuss in the deep, Mahakaman gnomes are able to evaluate whether the trouble is caused by kobolds or not. Members of the gnomish race inhabiting Tir Tochair seems to have less problems as they don't have an army.
Religion and magic.
Little is known about gnomish religion apart from the fact it allowed some of the gnomes, including Percival Schuttenbach, to avoid conscription by claiming a religious exemption. Gnomes once worshipped a deity similiar to Melitele, in that they worshipped a goddess of harvest and fertility. It is speculated that they worship some deity prefering joint work for the common good over pointless fighting. When it comes to death, they appear to follow the tradition of cremating their dead. However, it's unknown if this was done for practical purposes, part of their religion, or something else.
Certain areas of the gnomish culture resolve around their advanced alchemy. The Tree of Life seems to be based on the ten Sephirot artifacts – or the other way around.
The use of magic seems to be rather uncommon trait for gnomes, but not impossible. Some individuals are said to know a broad range of counter-spells. Some of otherworldly gnomish burglars are known to utilize the Invisibility spell in order to be unseen by non-magic folk, but it is unknown whether the Continental gnomish burglars do so as well.
Characteristics.
Appearance.
Gnomes are shorter and weaker than dwarves, but just as resilient and more agile. They are easily distinguished from dwarves and halflings by their more slender shape of a body, exceptionally long noses and pointed teeth.
Another defining factor is a beard. Unlike dwarves who always have beards, gnomes either cut theirs short or don't have them at all. Even an exceptionally large and strong gnome with a well-groomed beard cannot be confused for a dwarf because of aforementioned noses which are twice as long as those of other races.
Personality.
Known to be extraordinarily clever, gnomes excel as smiths and metallurgists and use ancient techniques, patterns and methods to create superb weapons. Their most famous creation – gwyhyr – was considered the best sword in the world. Another profession typical of them is a miner.
Gnomish communities live in human cities as well, where their members work as jewelers, artisans, and pawnbrokers. Immature gnomes often work as gofers and office boys for dwarven banks. Some gnomes, on the other hand, tend to prefer less reputable ways of life and become burglars or highwaymen. During Northern War II, a few gnomes became upset by the Nordling prejudice and joined the Scoia'tael as a result.
They are also quite fun-loving, which is indicated by a saying "stir up trouble like a tipsy gnome".

Glossary Entry.
Gnomes
"Gnomes are secretive and mysterious. Most of them live in Mahakam and are allied with the dwarves; they seldom interact with humans. Gnomes are talented craftsmen, miners and inventors. Their technology is superior to that of humans, and gnome weapons can be equalled by no others. They are also considered the eldest race on the continent."
"The World of the Witcher".
 Gnomes, though shorter than dwarves and not as strong, are equally resistant to hardship and much more agile. This ancient and noble race is characterized by their long, pointy noses, in which they take great pride ... Like dwarves, they. love their handiwork, and are particularly adept at the arts of the metallurgist, the armorer, the jeweler, and the goldsmith. Not many, however, elect to ply their trade beyqnd their native lands, since their grand mastery, and the profits which it brings, 'inevitably becomes the object of envy and thus human aversion, which ends in slander at best and pogroms at worst.Reverend Jarre of Ellander the ElderThe Truthful Description of the Elder Races pg. 41, "The World of the Witcher"

The Nilfgaardian Empire ("Ceas'raet" in Nilfgaardian language) is the most powerful empire in the history of the known world. It is located in the southern part of the Continent and boasts both a thriving economy and a strong, well-trained army with talented commanders. It has expanded mostly through the conquest of foreign countries, which were then turned into provinces of the Empire. The Empire's inhabitants believe that "real" Nilfgaardians are only those born in the heart of the Empire, and not those born in the conquered provinces.
The provinces are ruled by either stewards or kings (in cases in which a king willingly surrenders, he retains his throne but is subject to the Emperor or just a vassal). The empire has expanded throughout the years, conquering new lands and going as far to the north as the Yaruga river during the reign of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis.
In the Northern Kingdoms, the Empire is portrayed as an overarching antagonist, with many free people of the North expressing hatred towards it with passion.

Geography.
Since the Peace of Cintra, the Empire spans from the Yaruga river in the north all the way down to southern parts of the continent, where only a short distance separates it from other mysterious and unknown lands such as Hannu, Zangvebar, Barsa, and Ofir.
To the west Nilfgaardian border is defined by the coastline of the Great Sea, to the east lies Tir Tochair mountain range as well as desolate wildernesses and barren grounds. On the East of the Empire it lies the endless Korath desert, also known as the "Frying Pan".
According to Queen Meve of Lyria and Rivia, the Empire is 30 times bigger than Lyria.
Climate.
The Empire spans a huge area and thus the climate varies greatly, from warm but mild in Cintra to hot and sunny weather around the Alba and down to the steppes and deserts bordering with the far south. Some territories have microclimates, which are dictated by both the land (like in the mountains or river deltas) to weather such as rain and wind.
A rather large portion of the Empire's territory is also based around the meridians. Sea coasts consist of green, lush, and fertile lands while the more inland areas tends to be barren, with the major exception being large river valleys.
History.
Birth of the Empire.
Nilfgaardians believe their history reaches back to the 2nd century. The first settlers mixed with the Black Seidhe, creating a nation consisting mostly of elven language, beliefs, customs and culture. Meanwhile, the valiant sheperds inhabiting scattered settlements on the Alba slowly incorporated the surrounding nations, appropriating their best traits like the culture, technology and military strategies, offering them safety and order in return. The two groups eventually merged during various conquests by neighbouring nations and periods of freedom, creating a unique heritage mixing the achievements of elves, Vicovarians, Etolians and several Alban tribes. At some point of their history, the Kingdom of Nilfgaard emerged.
The monarchs were aided by a council of advisors, which became known as the Senate. Over time, the Senate has gained more and more power, becoming a legislative body. During this period Nilfgaardian influences started to expand and neighbouring lands were slowly Nilfgaardized and the peoples brought under the dominion of the empire, through the "diplomacy of steel", were expected to learn its official language and adopt elements of the victors' culture.
Eventually, a couple of realms outside the Lower Alba were incorporated into the realm, either willingly or by force. The title of "Imperator" appeared, at first only as position in the army. Known lands that were joined in that period were Rowan and Ymlac, apparently also Ruach, Daerlan, Magne and Winneburg.
In the early 12th century "Imperator" Torres var Emreis overthrew the Senate and took absolute power. At first he referred to his realm only as a "kingdom" but during his later reign term "empire" was coined – and the "Emperor" with it.
Torres' reign also saw the adaptation, via the March 8th Edict, of the Great Sun ("Ard Feainn") as the state religion and coat of arms of the Empire.
Sometime after Torres' death, likely in the early 1200s, Fergus var Emreis ascended the throne. However, he was considered by many to be a weak emperor. In 1216, Emperor Fergus var Emreis decided to use Etolia as an example of the future that awaits all enemies of the Empire. Nilfgaardian Army attacked and overwhelmed Etolia, annihilated its power structures and decimated the values defining Etolian life. Fergus subjected Gemmera in that year as well. Vicovarian nobles influenced their ruler and Vicovaro asked to join Nilfgaard willingly, on its own initiative. Fergus was ultimately overthrown by the Usurper in 1233. During the coup, Fergus was killed by the Usurper while his son and heir, Emhyr, was cursed by the mage Braathens, who turned him into a humanoid hedgehog. Despite having dogs set on him, Emhyr managed to escape and, with help from his own acquaintances, left the Empire.
During the Usurper's reign, he proclaimed a national amnesty, diminished the cult of the Great Sun's rights, and, in 1239, he annexed Ebbing. During this long conflict, Metinna, Nazair, and even Maecht were conquered by the Empire by the mid-1250s.
In 1257 a uprising led by Ardal aep Dahy, Vilgefortz and other Emhyr's supporters stormed the Imperial Palace and killed the Usurper. Emhyr var Emreis, the right heir to the throne who was banished from his country, entered once again in Nilfgaard and became the new Emperor, gaining the nickname "the White Flame Dancing on the Barrows of his Enemies" or in Nilfgaardian language, "Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd".
First Northern War.
"For the full article, see :Northern War I."
During his reign, Emhyr continued the expansion started by the Usurper, beginning the First Northern War in 1263 by invading Cintra, winning the Battle of Marnadal at the Marnadal Stairs, before marching to Cintra's capital, which was besieged and most of the inhabitants slaughtered. Meanwhile, Emhyr tasked Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach, a knight within his secret service, to capture Cirilla, the granddaughter of Queen Calanthe of Cintra and Emhyr's secret daughter (and whom he planned to marry). However, Cahir failed in his task and was imprisoned for two years in the Citadel at Nilfgaard while Emhyr continued to try and push into the North. This came to an abrupt halt though during the devastating Battle of Sodden Hill where the North's mages played a crucial part and ended the First Northern War with Nilfgaard's defeat. Despite this, the Empire held fast to Cintra and in 1267 managed to suppress a rebellion, capturing their leader, Windhalm of Attre, and having him executed as a show of force.
Second Northern War.
"For the full article, see :Northern War II."
Still set on taking the North, in the summer of 1267 Emhyr set in motion plans to start the Second Northern War, this time enlisting the help of several powerful mages to stage a Thanedd coup to remove the North's mages and thus their advantage that won the last war. While the plan went awry, it ultimately led to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers downfall and, with King Demavend of Aedirn faking an invasion at his borders to try and make it look like it was the work of Nilfgaard, Emhyr used this to mobilize his army and invade the North once again. With the North in chaos from Vizimir II's assassination, Nilfgaard's invasion, and the distrust towards mages, it looked like Nilfgaard would finally capture the North.
However, to truly calm down the people of Cintra, Emhyr still needed Ciri and had people out looking for her. While he was presented with a girl around her age a few months after the Thanedd coup and officially named her queen of Cintra, he knew she wasn't his daughter and only recognized her as queen to quell the masses while he continued the search for the real one.
Stefan Skellen, one of the men entrusted in finding Ciri, had other plans in mind though, wanting to overthrow Emhyr and the monarchy and make the Empire a democracy instead. Together with Ardal aep Dahy, Broinne, D'Arvy, Joachim de Wett, and Berengar Leuvaarden, they decided to find Ciri but then kill her to prevent the continuation of a monarchy. This conspiracy failed though as Berengar Leuvaarden later revealed the plan to Emhyr for leniency. While he was spared, Emhy had Stefan Skellen captured and ordered his execution after a trial.
In the meantime, Nilfgaardian forces clashed against Temerian ones in the Battle of Brenna, where the Imperial Army lost and Field marshal Menno Coehoorn was killed. Following this huge failure, the Empire sent ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen to negotiate during the Peace of Cintra: in the end the Empire was forced to surrender once again to the North but was allowed to keep Cintra. Although the Empire was officially defeated, the huge damage caused by the war to the Northern Kingdoms forced the latter to buy great amounts of food from the Empire and from Kovir and Poviss, which greatly enriched them.
After Ciri was found, Emhyr was still set on marrying her until he realized the only thing that mattered to her was to be with her adoptive parents. With this, he let her go and, having fallen for False Ciri, who was still officially declared as Cinta's heir, married her in the spring of 1268, officially making Cintra part of the Empire.
Third Northern War.
"For the full article, see :Northern War III."
Third Northern War started around 1271 after the failed summit in Loc Muinne. Once again the army, commanded by the new Field Marshal Havart var Meohoen, invaded the North conquering the kingdoms of Aedirn, Lyria, Rivia, and Temeria, which remained without a leader after the Kingslayers murdered both Demavend III and Foltest by order of Emhyr. When Nilfgaard approached Kaedwen, King Radovid V of Redania invaded his neighbors and assumed control over Kaedwen. Instead of two weak enemies, Nilfgaard, who in the meantime conquered the capital city of Vizima in Temeria and was stationed in Velen, now was forced to face one large, powerful one.
"If Emhyr wins the war:" After the assasination of Radovid and the death of Sigismund Dijkstra, the North without a leader couldn't defeat the armed forces of Emhyr, who conquered the whole North.
"If Radovid wins the war:" Thank to the strategic moves of Radovid, Emhyr was ultimately defeated by Redanian troops and was ultimately assassinated once returned in Nilfgaard by his opposition, tired of his continuous failures during the war.
"If Dijkstra wins the war:" With Sigismund Dijkstra as head of state after Radovid's death, the North managed to defeat Emhyr's army, who was later assassinated by his opposition once returned in Nilfgaard.
Society.
"For the full article, see :Nilfgaardian (people)."
While the Empire's population comprises several different cultures and nations, the authorities are keen on slow "Nilfgaardization" of minorities, that is replacing local values and customs with those of "proper Nilfgaardian", Lower Alban heritage. Internal migration within imperial borders are encouraged: colonies of Lower Alban settlers are established within troubled provinces, while non-Nilfgaardian peasants loyal to the Empire are encouraged to settle in newly-conquered realms through attractive offerts; rebellious regions are cleansed through enslavement or ethnic cleansing of groups deemed "problematic".
On the other hand, Nilfgaardian Empire in general is considered a safer home than most Northern Realms for many nonhuman races. Save for groups like Wood Elves, nonhumans living in the Empire consider imperial system harsh, but just.
Military and intelligence.
"For the main article, see :Nilfgaardian Army."
The army count during the Second Nilfgaard War was ca. 320,000, as 300,000 attacked the Northern Kingdoms, while the remaining 20,000 - 50,000 remained in the Empire.[""]
The army's operations are backed by Imperial Military Intelligence. Rivalled only by Redanian Secret Service, the institution is able to gather information and sow dissent far beyond the frontlines.

"The Nilfgaardian Empire is a powerful and ancient realm in the far south. Its capital is the city of Nilfgaard, located on the river Alba. The Empire arose through conquests, assimilating nearby kingdoms. Only the inhabitants of lands near the river Alba have the right to call themselves Nilfgaardians. A significant amount of elven blood runs in the veins of the people, while their language is a variant of the Elder Language. The Empire is aggressive and willingly invades neighboring lands. Its war with the Northern Kingdoms ended five years ago, yet in spite of the peace treaty, Nilfgaard has failed to give up its claims on the northern territories."
"Led by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, also known as the White Flame Dancing on the Graves of his Enemies, the Nilfgaardian Empire is the most powerful state in the known history of the Continent. With the Emperor's appetite for constant expansion, the southern superpower is a constant threat to the kingdoms located in the north. Nilfgaard's booming economy and superior army make it a force to be reckoned with. Nilfgaardians believe in lineage and racial purity, which makes them hated and feared by the free peoples of the Continent—only those born within its original borders are considered true citizens. However, once conquered by the Empire, as long as you serve its greater goals and remain obedient, you're more than likely to live to see another day. Nilfgaard's dominant religion is the cult of the Great Sun, which is reflected by the sun symbol on the Empire's coat of arms. Although the Emperor does not officially condone other beliefs, as long as no one mixes their gods with current political affairs, peoples acquired via the Empire's expansions are free to pray to whatever they want."
 "Scroll 1: Nilfgaard is a nation of extremes. It is the largest, richest, most populated, most powerful and, without a doubt, the most ruthless."
 "Scroll 2: Nilfgaardians will stop at nothing to defeat their foes. The slaughter of civilians? An unavoidable pity. Poisoning wells? A pragmatic stratagem. Forcing slaves into a suicidal assault? Well... piled corpses work wonders for scaling walls."
 "Scroll 3: The word "peace" does not exist in the Nilfgaardian language. Ever since chroniclers began keeping records, Nilfgaard has unceasingly conquered, annexed, and vassalized their neighbors. And they won't rest until the Golden Sun shines upon the entire Continent."
 "Scroll 4: But why this need to conquer? Centuries of armed conflict have made the Nilfgaardian economy entirely dependent on the spoils of war and slave labor. In other words, if the Nilfgaardian war machine ever halted, their society would risk utter collapse. To survive, the Empire must pillage, pillage, pillage..."
 "Chest 1: Nilfgaardians intrepret loyalty quite differently than the rest of the Continent. For their emperor, they would jump head first into a pool of acid. Yet the moment their leader shows the slightest hint of weakness, it's as if his power turns to smoke and vanishes in the wind. The seat of the Empire cannot allow a mere ounce of incompetence, for due to its vastness and influence, even a minor mistake can lead to far-reaching and unforeseen consequences."
 "Chest 2: Many believe that Nilfgaard owes its dominance to its superbly equipped legions of heavy infantry. The truth is slightly more complex, however, for Nilfgaard acquires most of its territories without ever declaring war. It often suffices to deploy an assassin to remove the inconvenient leader, then send diplomats to deftly orchestrate the ensuing conflict between his heirs."
 "Chest 3: In contrast to their squabbling Nordling neighbors, Nilfgaardians have tremendous respect for the law. A court sentence, however unjust, is immediately executed to the letter. Imperial edicts may as well be the word of the gods. As a result, Nilfgaard is incomparably more organized than the kingdoms of the North... And its soldiers execute even the cruelest orders without question."

Northern Kingdoms

The Northern Kingdoms, also referred to as the Northern Realms and comprised most significantly of the Four Kingdoms, were a group of human states north of the Amell mountain range, the latter separating it from the Nilfgaardian Empire in the south. The Nilfgaardians commonly referred to their inhabitants as Nordlings within the Empire's core region and throughout the conquered provinces. Aside from humans, many dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings lived in the Northern Kingdoms as second-class citizens.
The Northern Kingdoms were invaded and partially conquered by the Nilfgaardian Empire during the Northern Wars. Amidst the Third Northern War, the only remaining sovereign monarch of the four major kingdoms was King Radovid V of Redania. As a result, the Northern Realms collectively became known as Radovid's Realms.
History.
Early history.
Upon the First Landing and the arrival of humans on the Continent, the Northern Kingdoms were just large areas of uncolonized land inhabited by the Elder Races and others, such as vrans and werebbubbs, before the eastward expansion of the people later known as Nordlings, around five hundred years ago.
The Nordlings built at least twenty-four cities throughout the kingdoms on the sites of former elven settlements, such as Novigrad and Vizima, after the elves were pushed east by human expansion.
First Northern War.
"For the main article, see :Northern War I."
In 1263, the First Northern War broke out when the Nilfgaardian Army, led by Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn, crossed the Amell, on the orders of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, into the Northern Kingdoms.
Nilfgaard quickly took control of the Marnadal Stairs, slaughtered Cintra, and caused Queen Calanthe to commit suicide. Marching north into Sodden, they seized Upper Sodden in a brief battle. From there, the Nilfgaardians crossed the Yaruga into Lower Sodden. But it was in the Battle of Sodden Hill that the united army of Aedirn, Kaedwen, Redania and Temeria decisively defeated the Nilfgaardians. Consequently, at least 30,000 lives were lost, including thirteen northern mages, and the Nilfgaardian forces retreated south across the Yaruga.

Former kingdoms and regions
 "Scroll 1: Temeria, Redania, Kaedwen, Aedirn, Kovir, Poviss... There are few who can keep track of the North's many kingdoms and duchies. No sooner had humans seized the land from dwarves and elves than shattered it into dozens of tiny pieces and continued the fight for control amongst each other."
 "Scroll 2: Time and time again, come the thaw of spring, the leaders of the North resumed their petty wars. Temeria attempted to strip Sodden from Cintra. Aedirn and Kaedwen vied for control of the Pontar Valley. Yet, when the black-clad Nilfgaardian legions appeared from the south, they reckoned that, in the end, they stood more united than divided."
 "Scroll 3: When the Nilfgaardian invasion began, most presumed the North would be obliterated in a matter of weeks. Yet, to their great surprise, the outnumbered and underequipped Nordlings managed to repel the Empire's legions."
 "Scroll 4: Had the involvement of mages proved the deciding factor in the North's victory? Or was it the tactical genius of well-trained generals? Perhaps the contributions of Oxenfurt's brilliant inventors? Debates on the topic rage to this day. It seems not even a united victory can keep Nordlings from being at each other's throats for long..."
 "Chest 1: The Northern Realms are bordered by three mountain ranges to the north, east, and south – the Dragon, Blue, and Amell Mountains – and the Great Sea to the west. Yet, what lies beyond these? Nordlings themselves are not quite certain, and to be honest, it's not their most pressing concern. Preoccupied by local disputes, quarrels, and wars, they haven't the time to take interest in foreign lands. Alas, the Nilfgaardian invasion serves as proof that the rest of the world is not of the same mind."
 "Chest 2: What links a town like Vizima, proud capital of Temeria, or Oxenfurt, a center of learning for all the North, with Aedd Gynvael, a provincial settlement at the end of the known world? Nothing, it would seem... After all, each of these places looks, sounds and even smells different. Their origins, however, are identical – all were founded atop ancient elven cities. The ruins sprawling beneath their streets bear witness to this fact. What caused elven civilization to collapse? Plague? Cataclysm? No... Their destruction was wrought by humans."
 "Chest 3: Nordlings often feel conflicted about magic and those who practice it. On the one hand, mages served an undeniably crucial role in the North's defense against Nilfgaard. Yet on the other, their unabashed egotism and tendency to meddle in politics became an irritation to communities and sovereigns alike. The epitome of such arrogance was Philippa Eilhart who, rather than sit content as king's counsel, resolved to take on a leading role herself. This dream would not last, however... And in the end, the flames of pyres raged across the North."

Halflings, sometimes called Hobbits and in Elder Speech Pherian, are one of the non-human and, despite the name, are actually a distinct race and not mixed, like half-elves.
Unlike gnomes and dwarves, with whom they share the best relations, halflings do not have a traditional homeland exclusively ruled and inhabited by their kind. Instead, they reside within human territories of the Northern Kingdoms, where they often face prejudice, as well as in the Nilfgaardian Empire and the valleys of Mahakam.
History.
Halflings arrived on the Continent during the Conjunction of the Spheres. At that time, established societies of other Elder Races and humans already existed, and given their relatively small numbers, many halflings chose to assimilate into these communities.
Over centuries of living among other races, halflings became well integrated into society. They formed small communities within cities, where they became indispensable by creating thriving businesses and offering a variety of products and services, particularly in cooking and tailoring. In rural areas, they established large farms and engaged in milling, beekeeping, and livestock farming, activities in which they demonstrated a natural aptitude.
During the Northern Wars in the 13th century, some halflings joined the Scoia'tael and took up arms against humans.
Characteristics.
Appearance.
All halflings are chubby and rather short, standing between two and four feet tall, and their big feet are covered with curly hair up to the shins. Because of this, they do not usually wear any shoes. Their hair varies from a chestnut brown to blonde or red even and is said to be as curly as ram's fleece.
Their clothing is usually modest, pleasant and neat, in bright and pastel colors, with pistachio-green seemingly being one of their favorites.
Halflings are also immune to majority of magic, including the beautifying glamour cosmetic which, to the great sorrow of hobbit girls, has no effect on them whatsoever.
Personality.
Generally speaking, halflings are a peaceful and calm rustic folk, more interested in the comforts of home than adventures and warfare. They deal mainly with agriculture and as such are mostly farmers, stockbreeders and merchants. Their large farms, like Hirundum near Gors Velen in Temeria, often provide food not only for local halflings but also for the entire surrounding region. Indeed, their passion for food and drinks is well known and their cuisine includes delicacies like roast goose in pear sauce.
It would seem that they are an easy prey for various thugs or slave hunters, but nothing could be further from the truth. When the need arises, halflings display exceptional agility, incredible speed, and talent at throwing all sorts of missiles unerringly. Some halflings joined the Scoia'tael guerrilla bands during the Second Northern War.

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Vizima, Wyzim, or Wyzima (Polish: "Wyzima") is the capital city of Temeria, one of the Northern Kingdoms.
History.
First Landing.
Vizima once was the location of an ancient elven settlement, which upon the great eastern expansion of humans approximately five hundred years ago, was abandoned by the elves and in its place humans built this city.
Foltest's reign.
Around 1266, between the First and Second Northern War, King Foltest introduced "ius stapulae" to Vizima, blocking all merchandise routes with inspection sites around the city, and seizing any Redanian or Nilfgaardian goods to be sold within the city.
Emblems.
The coat of arms present in the infobox, conceived by and recreated by , refers to historical arms of King Dezmod and the subsequent Temerian rulers.
"The Witcher".
Located on the shores of a beautiful lake, Vizima is a walled city and the main setting of "The Witcher" computer game. The city is under a state of quarantine for the duration of the game, so movement about town in general is limited most of the time, and totally restricted, for some particular areas.
"Vizima, the capital of Temeria, is the largest city in the kingdom. It is located on the shore of Lake Vizima, at the intersection of important trade routes, one of which is a waterway. Owing to a developed network of roads, the city draws considerable profit from trade. By King Foltest's order, the city is governed by Burgomeister Velerad. Vizima is divided into three large districts. The poorest one is the Temple Quarter, where Saint Lebioda's Hospital and the Cloister of the Order of the Flaming Rose are located. The Trade Quarter is home to the wealthiest and most important inhabitants, and both the town hall and the main marketplace are situated there. The oldest part of the city, Old Vizima, has been recently converted into a ghetto for non-humans."
"I acquired a pass which allows me to pass through the gates into the city in spite of the quarantine."
Gates.
This restriction of movement is achieved through guarded gates which separate the various areas. There are nine gates in total. Six main gates:
Three internal gates also restrict movement between areas of the city, at least for parts of the game:
During the Prologue, Chapter I, and Chapter IV, the city proper is inaccessible, but the main story takes place within its confines. The city and surroundings are divided into the following locations:
Surroundings.
Vizima is only mentioned in the "The Witcher 2".
"Lying where important trade routes converge, Temeria's capital sits picturesquely on the shore of Lake Vizima in the valley of the Ismena River, a tributary of the Pontar. The city is divided into four teeming quarters, which are home to thousands and host travelers from all corners of the world. The Royal Palace and court are both found here, and the city boasts many markets, temples, forges, shops, banks, workshops, inns and brothels. Since our story does not concern Vizima directly, I will end my description here and urge those interested to consult other sources."
Journal entry.
Following the regicidal events of the previous game, Nilfgaard invaded a weakened Temeria, subjecting its capital city to occupation. Residency of the Royal Palace has been taken up by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself, who personally invites Geralt to visit. Geralt can only access certain parts of the inner residence, namely, all the areas from the first game and one new area off the garden.

The Witcher (short story)

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"The Witcher" (Polish: "Wiedźmin") is a short story written by Andrzej Sapkowski, having first been published in the "Fantastyka" magazine and later in the now obsolete book "Wiedźmin" before being re-published in "The Last Wish". It introduces the witcher Geralt and his famous fight with a striga.
Summary.
The story begins with Geralt entering Vizima. Shortly afterwards, he kills three racist men in a bar fight, and is arrested by the City Guard and escorted to Velerad, the elderly castellan of Vizima. When asked to explain himself, Geralt refers to the bounty notices posted at the crossroads near Vizima, asking for an experienced monster hunter. At this point, Velerad tells Geralt of the striga and her origin. Near the beginning of King Foltest's reign, he got his sister, Adda, pregnant. She and the baby died giving birth, both being buried in a double coffin. Seven years later, the daughter awoke and slaughtered the inhabitants of the palace. She had become a striga.
Geralt meets with Foltest, who warns him not to harm the striga, for a wizard had told him that if someone prevented the striga from returning to her coffin by the third crowing of the rooster, then she would be cured, turning into an ordinary little girl. Geralt asks to see a miller (a survivor of one of the striga's earlier attacks). The soldier that brings him to Geralt is Foltest, disguised. He gives Geralt leave to kill his daughter if he found that she was an incurable case.
Geralt spends the night at the old palace (Foltest having moved to a new palace, unplagued by the striga's attacks). During the early night, Lord Ostrit, a magnate, tries to bribe Geralt into running away, as he wishes the striga to survive. This would eventually horrify the inhabitants of Vizima, who would more easily support Vizimir of Novigrad's rule. Geralt refuses, knocks Lord Ostrit out and ties him up. At midnight, he cuts Ostrit loose, using him as bait. He is soon found and killed by the striga.
Geralt fights with the striga, reluctant to use his silver sword. He ties the striga with a silver chain, which she breaks free of, despite silver being an antithesis to monsters of magic. She is eventually scared off when Geralt uses his sorcery to project the hate and malice in her own mind back at her. Geralt settles in for the night in the double coffin to wait for morning (not allowing the striga to sleep in her original coffin until the third crow of the rooster which would break the curse). In the morning, he sees an ordinary little girl who is lying on the floor. Leaning over her, he sees too late that her eyes are open. Using the last remnants of her talons, the striga slashes Geralt's throat. As he subdues the girl/striga, Geralt hears the third crowing of the rooster. Finally, he binds his neck, knowing he will faint.
The witcher wakes up, his neck bandaged, with Velerad (who was part of the group that had planned to just have the striga killed) admitting he was in the wrong. He assures Geralt that his silver sword, his three thousand oren reward and his possessions are safe. Geralt, soothed, falls asleep.
Adaptations.
Graphic novel.
The short story has been adapted as a graphic novel entitled ""Geralt" comic", written by Andrzej Sapkowski and Maciej Parowski, with art by Bogusław Polch.
"The Hexer".
The short story has been adapted as part of episode 8 of "The Hexer" TV series, titled "Rozdroże" ("Crossroads").
"The Witcher".
The intro sequence in "The Witcher" game is based on Geralt's fight with the striga in Vizima. The game also hints that although cured, there are rumours of Foltest's daughter Adda still having a striga's bloodthirsty heart. Other characters introduced in this story, such as King Foltest and Velerad, also appear in the game.
Netflix's "The Witcher".
The short story has been adapted in the Netflix TV series in its third episode titled "Betrayer Moon".
Translations.
"The Witcher", being the first, is the most translated of Sapkowski's stories. There have been three translations of the story into English - by Agnieszka Fulińska, Michael Kandel and Danusia Stok.
Agnieszka Fulińska.
Agnieszka Fulińska's translation was published as "Hexer" in the 2000 anthology "Chosen by Fate".
Michael Kandel.
Michael Kandel translated the story as "Spellmaker" for the "A Polish Book of Monsters" anthology. He took much liberty with the proper names, changing:
Kandel's translation of the story was used by CD PROJEKT RED in promotional materials of their "The Witcher", even though Kandel's versions of proper names were drastically different from the ones used in the game (which was generally more faithful to the Polish original).
Danusia Stok.
Danusia Stok's translation in "The Last Wish" is generally faithful to the original when it comes to proper names, with only slight changes to help English readers with pronunciation of some of them.

The Voice of Reason

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
"The Voice of Reason" (Polish: "Głos rozsądku") is a short story written by Andrzej Sapkowski and, while the first one in "The Last Wish", is also technically the framing story and is thus divided into seven parts throughout the book.
Most of this story takes place in the Temple of Melitele in Ellander while Geralt is recovering from injuries he received in a recent fight.
Summary.
The Voice of Reason 1.
Iola, a priestess of Melitele who has taken a vow of silence, enters the chamber in which Geralt is resting, then seduces Geralt.
The scene is followed by the short story "The Witcher".
The Voice of Reason 2.
Nenneke wakes Geralt and Iola up. The girl quickly leaves, and the elder priestess and the witcher talk while Nenneke checks Geralt's injuries. She chides him for 'losing his touch', for letting himself get hurt so badly by an ordinary striga. Meanwhile, Geralt's stand on faith and belief is made clear.
Later on the temple grounds, the cult of Melitele is described as Geralt walks the pathways looking for both Iola and Nenneke.
He finds Nenneke and they discuss faith once again. The priestess tries to get Geralt to agree on a trance, for she senses something 'wrong' about the man. He refuses, arguing that his lack of faith would make such an attempt pointless. She merely remarks that it would be the first time lack of faith would have any power at all.
This segues into the short story A Grain of Truth.
The Voice of Reason 3.
Falwick, count of Moën and Sir Tailles of Dorndal, both knights of the Order of the White Rose, arrive at the temple on a mission from Prince Hereward. Nenneke doesn't like either of them, her remarks growing more scathing the more Tailles revels in his youthful righteousness. The knights demand that Geralt leave immediately; Nenneke counters by telling them that the temple is not under the jurisdiction of any duke. Tailles sees red, and throws down his gauntlet, demanding a duel with Geralt. Nenneke ignores the gesture, calmly telling the adolescent to pick up what he dropped.
The knights leave with a promise to return, throwing one of Geralt's many aliases, "Butcher of Blaviken", into the conversation, thus introducing the third short story, The Lesser Evil.
The Voice of Reason 4.
Geralt sits with the silent Iola in the gardens of the temple. Geralt tells her about witchers, how they came to be, about Kaer Morhen and Vesemir. About destiny and how he shouldn't have stuck his spoon into that soup, cuing the short story A Question of Price.
The Voice of Reason 5.
Dandelion, Geralt's faithful friend, arrives at the temple. Nenneke says she despises him, but the witcher and the bard get along very well. Having hit a patch of blues, Geralt wonders out loud about the sorry state of witchers, about how he can barely make a living anymore. Dandelion doles out some words of wisdom, which lead to him asking Geralt if he remembers the events at "the Edge of the World".
The Voice of Reason 6.
In the crystal-roofed caves on the temple grounds, where the air is humid and an astonishing variety of both rare and ordinary plants and herbs grow. While Nenneke tends the flora, the priestess and Geralt discuss Yennefer. The witcher wishes to give part of the reward he received for the striga to the temple, and asks Nenneke if she would forward the rest, a few gems to Yennefer, to help her finance her search for "a cure". Nenneke refuses to work as an intermediary, and they argue about Yennefer and her situation. The priestess pleads with Geralt to stay on a while longer at the temple to heal, bringing up the idea of a trance again. He refuses, again.
Finally, Nenneke asks about how this thing between the witcher and the sorceress began, setting up "The Last Wish".
The Voice of Reason 7.
Outside the safety of the temple walls, Geralt and Dandelion are riding down a road, when they're suddenly surrounded and stopped by lancers, knights of the Order of the White Rose, and the captain of Hereward's guards, a dwarf named Dennis Cranmer. Geralt is forced to either accept Tailles' earlier challenge, or face the gallows. The rules of the duel further state that if Geralt even touches Tailles with his sword, the witcher will be made to suffer a slow death.
Geralt accepts the challenge, and the duel is short with the witcher easily evading the inept slashing of the adolescent. The duel ends as their blades meet and Geralt's block causes Tailles' own blade to slash his face. Falwick, seeing that the boy was injured, demands that the footmen seize Geralt, but Cranmer stops him stating that the rules of the duel were fulfilled "to the letter", and that Geralt is free to go.
After a not so fond farewell to the representatives of the Order and a much fonder farewell to Dennis, Geralt and Dandelion leave. The witcher plans his route with Dandelion as they go. They make a brief stop back at the temple where Nenneke informs them that she has restocked Geralt's box of elixirs. Iola appears and brings the box to the witcher. As their hand touch, the girl is whisked away by a vision (or has an epileptic seizure).
Nenneke and the other acolytes try to calm her. Once the fit subsides, Nenneke instructs the younger priestesses to take Iola to her room and watch her. She then turns to Geralt as if to plead one last time that he undergo a trance, but the witcher merely comments that he's seen it before, that there's no point in watching over one's shoulder. Still, the priestess begs him to stay, but Geralt leaves.

The Witcher gameplay

Perspective.
"For the main article, see :Camera movement."
The game can be played from either an over the shoulder (OTS) or one of two isometric perspectives. The OTS perspective was designed for exploration and questing, whereas the isometric perspectives were designed to give a better tactical view in combat. Many players stay in OTS mode all the time as Geralt almost always fights solo and this view mode, in addition to being more immersive, gives a more cinematic experience in combat.
Here are screenshots of the three view modes (isometric mode can either be close to Geralt or a bit further away).
Character development.
"For the main article, see :Character development."
Unlike most computer role playing games, in "The Witcher" players do not get to create their own characters, but instead take the role of Geralt, the character from Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher series of books. However, Geralt's skills can be developed throughout the game in various ways.
As Geralt proceeds about his various quests, he acquires bronze, silver and ultimately gold talents which can then be allocated to enhance his Attributes, Signs, Steel and Silver sword skills. Attributes include:
The five magical signs are: Aard, Axii, Igni, Quen and Yrden. There are also three fighting styles: strong, fast and group, for both sword types.
Inventory.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher inventory."
This inventory is quite different from most RPG orientated games. Because it does not allow you to store any weapons, armor or other overly large random items. Instead, it revolves around the fact that you carry a satchel in which you can merely place smaller odds and ends like potion ingredients, food, drinks, books, scrolls, etc... and also just a limited number of these items, though that limit is reasonably large.
The inventory is divided up in general sections each consisting of small compartments, or slots in which a single can be stored. They are:
Journal.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher journal."
The in-game journal tracks information from a variety of sources. As Geralt learns about formulae, monsters, characters, places and so on, new journal entries are added for future reference. Some of these entries contain clues to help devise an effective strategy, for example detailing a monster's strengths and weaknesses.
The quest portion of the journal tracks Geralt's progress as he takes on and progresses through the many quests in game. Quests can be broken into subsections based on which Chapter they occur in, whether they are active or not, and the current phase of multi-part quests can be selected as well. To aid the player there is also an option to track the selected quest, which puts a marker on the in-game map and provides a directional arrow to the next objective in the mini-map.
Combat system.
"For the main article, see :Witcher fighting styles."
"For the main article, see :The Witcher weapons."
"For the main article, see :The Witcher armor."
The combat system in "The Witcher" represents a departure from most RPGs. Players choose one of three fighting styles. The quick style allows for faster, less-damaging attacks with a greater chance of hitting faster enemies; the heavy style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style, which features sweeping attacks best used if the player is surrounded.
Each of these stances has its own unique combat style. Both of Geralt's main swords — the steel and silver ones — have distinctively different combat styles from the rest of weaponry, and serve very distinct purposes: where the steel blade is used to fight humans and other flesh-and-blood beings, the silver one is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts (against some of which steel may have no effect whatsoever).
Alchemy.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher alchemy."
Alchemy is a major part of gameplay. The player can create potions that increase health or endurance regeneration, allow Geralt to see in the dark, or provide other beneficial effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through scrolls, or by experimentation. Once the player creates an unknown potion he can choose to drink it, but if the potion is a failure it will poison the character. Each time Geralt drinks potions they increase the toxicity level of his body. This can be reduced by drinking a special potion or by meditating at an inn or fireplace.
In addition to potions, the player can also create oils and bombs, respectively used to augment the damage done by weapons, or as weapons in combat. Neither can be created until talent points have been allocated into the corresponding skills.
Character interaction.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher character interaction."
As Geralt explores Vizima, he meets a huge variety of characters, many of whom have quite a bit to say. Some of them also offer services or opportunities to explore activities beyond simple dialogue. These options are explored through the use of character interaction icons.
The above icons all appear during dialogue sequences with other game characters. They allow Geralt to interact with the various game characters he meets along his Path.
Choices and consequences.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher decision checklist."
An innovative, time delayed decision-consequence system means that the repercussions of players decisions will make themselves apparent up to 10 –15 hours later in the game. This prompts the players to put more critical thinking into making each decision, and circumvents a save-reload approach to decision making. It also allows the game to have a unique approach to replay value, as the consequences resulting from the player's decisions can lead to great difference in the events that take place later, and ultimately a very different gameplay experience than in the prior play-throughs.
The nature of the options faced when playing the game rarely falls into the typical black-and-white morality present in most regular computer RPGs, and the players often find themselves choosing from the lesser of two evils rather than making a clear choice between good and evil, a situation more reflective of real-life morality.
Controls.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher controls."
In the game, the player will usually use a combination of both the mouse and keyboard commands. Using one or the other exclusively is nearly impossible.
Mouse.
In this game, mouse movement follows generally uses the left-click. For more information, see the Controls main article.
Keyboard commands.
In this game, keyboard movement follows the standard W A S D set-up. For more information, see the Controls main article.
Differences between localized versions of the game.
North American version.
North American users can restore edited romance cards, game models, and blood/finishing moves by downloading the Director's Cut patch. (North American users who play the game on Steam do not need to download anything; this version has already been updated to the Director's Cut.)
Regardless of version, the aforementioned creatures, and Triss Merigold in her field outfit, have breasts that move, or jiggle, as the creature or character moves, though this movement is rather exaggerated and might remind the observer of a popular food gelatin.

The Witcher storyline

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
The game is centered around Geralt of Rivia, who is found unconscious and suffering from amnesia at the beginning of the game. He gradually learns that he was a renowned witcher, and that he has friends and enemies almost everywhere (who do "not" suffer from amnesia...). Through the player's actions, he will redefine those relationships and choose his path in the political intrigue that surrounds him.
Paths.
In the game, Geralt will be forced to choose his path. There are three primary paths available to him. In this wiki, they will be referred to as follows:
The Scoia'tael path (with the squirrel puff icon): on this path, Geralt allies himself with fellow non-humans, the Elves.
The Order path (with the Flaming rose insignia icon): on this path, Geralt allies himself with the Order of the Flaming Rose, whose mission is to protect the citizens of Temeria.
The Witcher / neutral path (with the witcher medallion icon): on this path (most in line with Geralt's personality from "The Witcher" series), Geralt sides with neither the Scoia'tael nor the Order - either to maintain 'witcher neutrality' (referred to several times in the game, presumably referring to politics) or simply to do what he feels is right. (Whatever the reasoning, only the witcher's closest friends will understand - let alone agree with - this path.)

Geralt starts his adventure in the citadel of Kaer Morhen where bandits attack led by two shady characters, the Professor and a mysterious mage. The player eventually learns that they are part of a criminal organization called the Salamandra, and that they are after some special potions and equipment which were developed to genetically alter witchers to give them their powers. What they want with those potions is unclear.
The chapter ends as the Professor and the mage teleport out of Kaer Morhen with the potions. The remaining witchers and allied characters decide to split up and search for information about the Salamandra to eventually stop them.
Links.
This chapter opens introducing Alvin, an unusual child whose path will repeatedly cross Geralt's. Hot on the trail of the mysterious men with Salamander badges, our witcher explores the outskirts of Vizima, where a terrifying beast harasses the villagers by night. The witcher encounters old friends (whom he doesn't recognize at first) and makes connections with locals while seeking a way into the city, even finding a hint or two about the fate of his fellow witcher Berengar. After striving to gain the trust of several prominent locals and perhaps dealing with a few less-than-prominent ones, Geralt manages to get through the Miller's Gate into Vizima proper - though not on his own terms.
There are two trophy quests in this and each subsequent chapter.
Links.
Geralt now has access to the Temple Quarter, where he will have to solve a mystery. Who sent assassins after him? Who is involved with the Salamandra? Several influential people in the city are suspects, and Geralt has the help of the private investigator to sort through the clues and follow up on them.
Note that Geralt no longer has access to the Outskirts in this chapter, but he gains access to the Temple Quarter, part of the Vizima sewers, the Vizima dike, the Vizima cemetery, and the Swamp.
Links.
During Chapter III, Geralt will have to follow new leads on the Salamandra, while investigating the mysterious powers of the child Alvin whom he rescued in Chapter I. The Scoia'tael also start being more bold in their attempts.
"Important:" The choice of whether to bring Alvin to Triss or Shani may alter the events in the remaining chapters.
Note that Geralt still has access to the areas he had access to in the second chapter, and he additionally gains access to the Trade Quarter as well as new areas of the Vizima sewers.
Links.
Geralt now finds himself in a totally new area of Temeria, far from Vizima and cut off from most of the people he knew. Dandelion and Alvin are with him though, as is Abigail (if Geralt saves her from the villagers in Chapter I, otherwise the village healer is an old woman) and there are new intrigues around him. Depending on the choice made in Chapter I, the resolution to The Heat of the Day quest is different.
The chapter ends with a showdown between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael, where Geralt must finally declare his chosen path and act accordingly.
Note that Geralt no longer has access to the areas he had access to in any of the previous Chapters. He can now explore the areas of Lakeside, Murky Waters village, the Fields and Black Tern Island.
Links.
Note that Geralt no longer has access to the areas he had access to in Chapter IV. He can now explore the areas of Old Vizima, the swamp cemetery and the old manor area.
Scoia'tael path.
Geralt fought with the Scoia'tael in their battle with Flaming Rose forces in Murky Waters. Now Vizima is burning, the conflict taking more and more casualties. Geralt meets Zoltan Chivay once again, and must help him and the refugees flee Old Vizima for the relative safety of the swamp cemetery. King Foltest has returned just as his daughter Adda seems to be having a relapse of her Striga curse. Geralt must do what he can for the princess; in return, Foltest will divulge what he knows about the Salamandra hideout so that Geralt can finally deal with Azar Javed.
Order path.
Geralt fights for the Order in the conflict between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael in Murky Waters. But Vizima now burns, the conflict taking more and more casualties. Geralt meets Rayla once again, and must help her in Old Vizima and get to Siegfried who lies wounded in the field hospital. At the same time, King Foltest returns and his daughter Adda seems to be having a relapse of the Striga curse. Geralt must do what he can for the princess, and in return, Foltest will divulge what he knows about the Salamandra hideout, and as a result, Azar Javed's location
Choosing the Order path means that Zoltan is rather miffed at Geralt, and he must find an Order armorer.
Witcher / Neutral path.
Geralt does not escape the conflict between the Order of the Flaming Rose and the Scoia'tael in Murky Waters but ends up having to fight both sides. But Vizima now burns, the conflict taking more and more casualties. Geralt meets some nurses who are trying to get to Shani at the field hospital. The witcher must then also help Shani get out of Old Vizima to the swamp cemetery to get medicine from the druids. At the same time, King Foltest returns and his daughter Adda seems to be having a relapse of the Striga curse. Geralt must do what he can for the princess, and in return, Foltest will divulge what he knows about the Salamandra hideout, and as a result, Azar Javed's location.

With Princess Adda's curse resolved, King Foltest and King Radovid of Redania forge an alliance. If Adda survives, Foltest agrees to give her hand in marriage to Radovid in exchange for Radovid's army's help in resolving the Order/Scoia'tael conflict. It is revealed that Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg was behind Salamandra all along, using it and Azar Javed to build an army of mutants, overthrow Foltest and take the throne. With Javed dead, the Grand Master will be expecting Geralt's visit.
Foltest and Radovid agree to use their armies to attack the Order of the Flaming Rose. Geralt is given permission to eradicate the Grand Master and any of his servants.
Scoia'tael path.
Yaevinn asks for freedom for the elves, and King Foltest acknowledges him cautiously, stating that he will only pardon those who lay down their arms. Foltest recommends that Yaevinn leave the kingdom, a symbolic gesture allowing people to perceive the banishment as punishment for his crimes during the uprising. Foltest then promises Geralt that he will protect the witcher's friends from harm and not pursue Yaevinn terribly vigorously.
Geralt and Yaevinn confront Siegfried shortly thereafter. Siegfried calls Geralt inhuman and expresses regret for not killing him when they first met. Siegfried dies.
Geralt and Yaevinn are then ushered into a safe house, where characters from various chapters and locations are hiding. Golan Vivaldi pities himself, stating that both the Order and the Scoia'tael loathe him and consider him a traitor. Vaska is unhappy about war spreading to her village. The Hermit wanted to give advice to King Foltest, but did not arrive in time. The novice nun reminds Geralt of the prophecy of Ithlinne, stating that the world is near its end. Carmen is also there, if Geralt previously killed Vincent. In the cellar, Vetala and the resolute girl from Lakeside idle. Geralt and Yaevinn proceed through the cellar into a monster-infested basement. Upstairs from there, a madman advises them to exit through his window.
Another fight ensues outside, and Geralt takes a key from a wounded Order knight. Geralt and Yaevinn descend into the sewer where they face another tough monster, the zeugl.
After traveling through dire sewers, Geralt and Yaevinn finally reach the cloister where the Grand Master resides. Yaevinn is wounded and tells the witcher to go on without him.
Order path.
Siegfried convinces Foltest that the Order can remain loyal to the king despite de Aldersberg's actions, and Foltest names him the new Grand Master. Geralt and Siegfried confront the remaining knights of the Order shortly after.
Geralt and Siegfried are then ushered into a safe house, where characters from various chapters and locations are hiding.

Geralt and Siegfried proceed through the cellar into a monster-infested basement. Upstairs from there, a madman advises them to exit through his window.
They meet Yaevinn outside. The elf is disgusted with Geralt and they duel. Yaevinn dies. Geralt then takes a key from a wounded Order knight. Geralt and Siegfried descend into the sewer where they face another tough monster, the zeugl.
Geralt and Siegfried finally reach the cloister where the Grand Master resides. Siegfried is wounded and tells the witcher to go on without him.
Witcher / Neutral path.
Geralt arrives back in the Temple Quarter with Triss Merigold and informs the king of his findings.
Geralt and Triss confront Siegfried shortly after; Geralt chooses whether to kill or spare the knight.
Geralt and Triss go to a shelter, where Golan Vivaldi, Vaska, the Hermit, and the novice nun have gathered. Vivaldi pities himself, stating that both the Order and the Scoia'tael loathe him. Vaska is unhappy about war spreading to her village. The Hermit states that he wanted to give advice to King Foltest, but did not arrive in time. The novice nun reminds Geralt of the prophecy of Ithlinne, stating that the world is near its end. Carmen is also there, if Geralt previously killed Vincent. In the cellar, Vetala and the resolute girl from the Lakeside idle. Geralt and Triss leave through the cellar, into a monster-infested basement. Upstairs from there, a madman advises them to exit through his window.
Geralt meets Yaevinn outside and has the opportunity to kill or spare him, as with Siegfried earlier. More fighting occurs either way; then Triss says they must descend into the sewer. There is no wounded knight to give them a key - Triss has it already.
After traveling through dire sewers and dispatching the zeugl, Geralt and Triss finally reach the cloister where the Grand Master resides. At this point, Geralt uses a ruse to ditch Triss so he can go on alone.
The Paths converge.
From this point, no matter which path Geralt has chosen, he goes on alone. When Geralt finds the Grand Master, it is revealed that everything he has done was to save humanity from the inevitable "Great White Frost" (Ithlinne's Prophecy). All his life, he was plagued by visions of what the future of humanity would look like if nothing was done. His solution was simple: he would become their savior.
To achieve this, de Aldersberg had recently developed mutants known as Greater Brothers, who had all the strength and skill of a witcher, without the sentimentality. These mutants would shepherd Believers on an exodus to the south, thereby saving them from the dire predictions. Geralt quite rightly remarks at that point that every megalomaniac speaks of a "higher purpose". And with the help of the friends he has made during the course of the story, Geralt makes it through the Grand Master's vision and ends his plans.
Geralt's final choice involves a demand from the King of the Wild Hunt for the Grand Master's soul.
Choice 1: Deny the King of the Wild Hunt's demand, thus freeing himself from his destiny of leaving only destruction behind him. or
Choice 2: Allow the King of the Wild Hunt's demand, thus avoiding the fight and learning that the Grand Master was known to him by another name.
"Note:" In the Epilogue, Geralt no longer has access to any areas in Chapter V. He is now back in the Temple Quarter, to be teleported to the Ice Plains, and finally back to the Cloister courtyard.
Ending cinematic.
In the end, Geralt is seen accepting his reward for dispatching the Grand Master and his mutants. As the White Wolf nears the palace doors, he notices the corpses of the drowsy guards shown in the beginning of the cinematic. He draws his sword and rushes for the king's study, finding Foltest under attack by a lone assassin. A fight ensues between the Witcher and the unknown assailant, and the latter is starting to get the better of the former... until the newly acquired coin purse is used for a distraction, allowing Geralt to sever an arm. The would-be murderer is unmasked: it is an unfamiliar face... with very familiar eyes (witcher's eyes).

 All contracts require a bestiary entry (Except the Dog contract). The bestiary entry can be obtained by purchasing books from the dwarf that sells books outside Shani's house. (The books on average cost around 500 orens.)
Women.
IMPORTANT! Chapter III of The Witcher takes an interesting turn. The game creates a love triangle between Shani, Triss and Geralt. The player is faced with an ultimatum and must choose his affections in the end. After Triss tells Geralt to bring Alvin to her, the player has a choice to choose either Shani or Triss by bringing Alvin to the one he desires to court. The decision you make nearly completely removes the other women out of Geralt's life. You will no longer be able to associate with that woman. The woman you take Alvin to will take him in as her own and want to raise him with Geralt. Of course, this triggers a new sex scene, and along with that a new lover card. It should also be noted Triss appears in The Witcher II, whereas Shani does not. (Your decisions in this game affect the next one!)
 
Dice Players.
Note: Professional players will only play other professionals. If you have advanced past professional by beating 4 others, the remaining professional will not play you (e.g. You beat Thaler and Munro Bruys in Chapter II and Count Roderick de Wett and Velerad in Chapter III, the Hierophant will not play you. However, once the gamble icon is unlocked for a player, it remains unlocked even if you have advanced past their level. So, even if you advance past professional, you can still play professionals you have already beaten, just not professionals you have never played.

Elder Races or Old Races is a collective name used by humans to describe those who preceded them on the Continent. The so-called old races include:
Of these three, gnomes were the oldest sentient race on the continent with the dwarves following.

Kaer Morhen (corruption of Elder Speech: Caer a'Muirehen, meaning "Keep of the Elder Sea") is an old keep where witchers of the School of the Wolf used to be trained. It is located in the Blue Mountains of Hertch in the kingdom of Kaedwen, right off the Gwenllech river. The castle can only be reached by "The Witchers Trail", nicknamed "The Killer", which is easy to miss and encircles the keep. While Trials and Changes are no longer performed here, witchers still tend to rest here between their assignments—usually during the winter, after which they set out on The Path again.
The keep's name is a nod to an ancient sea in the area, indicated by the presence of fossilized sea creatures embedded in the stones on which it was built.
History.
 They want to mutate the child, subject her to the Trial of Grasses and Changes, but they don't know how to do it. Vesemir was the only witcher left from the previous generation, and he was only a fencing instructor. The Laboratorium, hidden in the vaults of Kaer Morhen, with its dusty demi-johns of elixirs, the alembics, ovens and retorts ... None of the witchers knew how to use them. The mutagenic elixirs had been concocted by some renegade wizard in the distant past and then perfected over the years by the wizard's successors, who had, over the years, magically controlled the process of Changes to which children were subjected. And at a vital moment the chain had snapped. There was no more magical knowledge or power. The witchers had the herbs and Grasses, they had the Laboratorium. They knew the recipe. But they had no wizard. Triss's inner monologue, pg. 61-62 "Blood of Elves" (U.K. edition)
Ancient times and construction of the keep.
Oxenfurt Academy scholars speculate that in the place where the current keep stands there was originally an ancient elven defensive structure. The Circle of Whispering Stones was likely erected during that era.
By the time Nordlings erected the modern castle in the 2nd half of the 11th century, Wolf School witchers had already been present in the caves of Kaer Morhen valley. Human inhabitants eventually left the keep for some reason and it became the seat of the Wolf witchers.
School of the Wolf at its height.
The keep and the bastion, encircled by The Killer, were the primary training area for young Wolves. In the Laboratorium beneath the castle resident renegade mages and druids performed the Trials and Changes which transformed boys into witchers.
The men at Kaer Morhen rarely had anything to do with the Kaedwenian locals, maintaining a delicate balance that neither wished to disrupt. As one could not find the fortress without the knowledge of the treacherous trail, it used to remain on the outskirts of history books. Legends claim that it is in Kaer Morhen where young Esteril Thyssen and his wife Agnes of Aedirn hid from King Videmont's wrath in 1160s.
Pogrom and decline.
The dwindling number of monsters, together with the vile acts committed purportedly by witchers and reported in "Monstrum, or Description of the Witcher" pamphlet, resulted in anti-witcher sentiments growing amongst the Kaedwenian population. In the 1170s a mob of peasants led by opportunistic mages stormed Kaer Morhen massacring everyone inside—23 witchers and forty students, including children, and the renegade mages who oversaw the mutation process. Only those members of the Wolf School who remained outside the castle survived. The pogrom was officially condemned as an "isolated incident", with some of the attackers even expressing regret.
While their numbers were greatly reduced, witchers continued to run the School. Rennes took the mantle of the Grandmaster after Barmin and Vesemir replaced Varin as a fencing instructor. As many of the mages perished during the pogrom, the mutation process was even harsher—some boys were subjected to additional experiments, mostly with fatal results. During one of such experiments all subjects save for Geralt died.
Finally the chain of witcher production snapped when the last wizard capable of performing the Trials and Changes died or vanished, marking late 1230s or early 1240s as the last time when young witchers practiced at The Killer. One of the youngest fully-trained Wolves was Lambert.
After the end.
The end of training did not mark the end of Kaer Morhen. While new adepts were no longer and the keep was a ruin of its former self, adult witchers still arrived here to spend winters with their comrades. In 1242, Eskel's surprise child, Deidre Ademeyn, took refuge in the fortress to hide from her brother Merwin's men.
In 1264, Geralt brought the orphaned Ciri to Kaer Morhen, where she met Lambert, Eskel and Vesemir who were staying there for the winter, as well as Coën, a visitor from the School of the Griffin. By that year, Vesemir was considered to be the only witcher left from the previous generation of the Wolves.
As Ciri manifested unnatural powers, for the next year's winter the witchers invited Triss Merigold to watch over the girl. While Triss initially suspected the witchers wanted her to mutate Ciri, it turned out they were just afraid of the girl's magical abilities. As Triss feared she was unable to control Ciri, she convinced Geralt and others to put the young witcheress to care of a more experienced sorceress; thus in spring 1266 Geralt, Triss, and Ciri left for the temple in Ellander where Ciri was to be tutored by Yennefer of Vengerberg.
In 1270 Triss and the remaining witchers were training Leo, a new student whom Vesemir took after Geralt's supposed death during the Rivian Pogrom two years prior. One night, the miraculously alive Geralt was found near the fortress, fallen unconscious after escaping an unknown foe.
Soon after Geralt regained consciousness, the castle came under attack by a criminal organization, the Salamandra, and the school's closely guarded herbs that were once used for the Trial of the Grasses were stolen and Leo was killed. After Leo was buried just outside Kaer Morhen, the witchers aided by Triss left in different directions to learn more about their attackers and recover the ingredients.
Two years later the witchers once more met up here upon learning that Ciri was back but was being chased by the Wild Hunt. Yennefer arrived before Geralt to begin preparations, as she wished to use the first part of the Trial of the Grasses on Uma, an odd creature that was their only link to learning what happened to Ciri. After a successful transformation, Geralt headed out and soon brought Ciri back, but with the Wild Hunt right on their tail. During the Battle of Kaer Morhen, the group tried various tactics to defend their home, but were eventually overpowered, resulting in Vesemir's death, until Ciri's Elder Blood activated, threatening to destroy not just the Wild Hunt members but the entire fortress along with it. However, a weakened Avallac'h was able to stop her.
The remaining allies then held a pyre funeral for Vesemir before the witchers decided to go their separate ways, leaving Kaer Morhen behind.

"Kaer Morhen is an inaccessible mountain stronghold which has been the headquarters of the witchers' guild for centuries. The name comes from the language of the elves — the original Caer a'Muirehen translates into Old Sea Fortress. The castle's time of greatness has passed, the battlements and moat have deteriorated, and a cold wind blows through the spacious halls. Currently, only a handful of witchers live here, but once many young boys underwent gruesome training along the infamous "Gauntlet" near Kaer Morhen."

"Years ago a horde of fanatics, their hatred incited by various publications defamatory of witchers, laid siege to Kaer Morhen. The mob would not have captured the fortress nor later turned it into a ruin without the help of mages. Practically all those who were in the Old Sea Fortress during the assault perished. From among those witchers who called Kaer Morhen home, only a few survived the massacre, merely because they were out on their Paths at the time. The bones of the dead remain at the bottom of the moat surrounding the stronghold, left there as a reminder of the massacre that was born from hatred directed against changelings."

Swamp

The swamp, also known as the "swamp forest", is populated (at least temporarily) by a village of brickmakers, an old recluse, a group of druids who live in a beautiful grove, a visiting dryad, several lumberjacks, a hidden camp of Scoia'tael and (of course) a host of beasts and monsters. There is also a tower in the middle of the area, which seems to breed creatures...
 "Across the lake from Vizima lies a large area of marshlands which is home to small human communities, but also to various monsters. It is not safe there, even during the day — a drowner or a bloedzuiger can spring from the murky water at any moment. The casual traveler should also be mindful of the misleading will-o'-the-wisps, which have a tendency to lure unwary adventurers further and further into the swamp, until they become mired in mud and perish. To reach the swamp, one must hire a ferryman at the Dike in Vizima and take the boat across the lake."
 "A group of lumberjacks works deep within the marshlands, making money by selling lumber to Viziman craftsmen. They are lead[] by a dwarf named Yaren Bolt, who rules the small community with an iron fist."
 "The swamp is home to brickmakers who make their living excavating and firing clay. Theirs is a small, secluded village, where life proceeds at its own pace. A somewhat crazed woman named Vaska leads them."
 "The swamp is a place where man must bow before Nature in all its wild, tangled grandeur. That is why the druids have settled there, establishing a sacred grove with the tree of life at its center. The disciples of Nature allow no violence within the grove, where they tend to sick animals, even taking in wounded dryads."
 "The misty marshes hide many secrets. For example, there is a small clearing where statues of powerful golems are half-buried in the mud as if frozen mid-step. One of them is particularly unsettling, towering ominously over the clearing"

Vizima dike

The dike is the site of many of Declan Leuvaarden's commercial concerns. It seems to be the main entry to and exit from Vizima. It is here also that Geralt finds the ferryman who will take him to the Swamp, and back, if so desired.
In Chapter III, a Desperate merchant also takes up a post on the dike. He is looking for a witcher to help retrieve a long lost family heirloom.
"Just outside the Vizima's walls is a landing where merchants and travelers dock their boats. You can hire transport to the nearby swamp from there or look at wares that will soon find their way to marketplace stalls. There is also a passage from the Dike into Old Vizima, though the gate leading to that quarter is closed due to the quarantine. The epidemic, or fear of it, has also brought boat traffic on the lake to a nearly complete halt."

Vizima sewers

Infobox Needed&lt;br&gt;This article or section needs an infobox template added.
The sewers under Vizima are quite extensive and hold many surprises for the unwary or unprepared. They are infested with drowners and drowned dead, not to mention ghouls and a zeugl. They also hold their fair share of loot in the various chests, sacks and corpses found in the main sewers, not to mention what can be found in the Cult of the Lionhead Spider's lair and the crypt.
The sewers can be accessed from a few different places and in a couple of different ways. There are the main entrances: one from the Temple Quarter and one from the Trade Quarter. There is also a floor grate in the jail which leads to the sewers, and finally, beginning in Chapter III, one can now use a grate near the steps leading into the slums or directly teleport into the elven ruins.
You can travel between the Temple and Trade quarters by way of the network of sewers, but it is a dirty, smelly, monster-infested route — unless you like that sort of thing. It also hides a fisstech production laboratory which is run by the local drug lord, Gellert Bleinheim.
"The sewers beneath Vizima were built in the age when an ancient elven city stood on this site. Not much of their original greatness remains, but they still serve their function well. Connecting the Temple Quarter and the Trade Quarter, they carry off sewage from the entire city, rendering the stench of the gutters a little less overbearing. The sewers have recently become infested with monsters, especially drowners. Apparently, a cockatrice has also made its lair there."
"Secluded and rarely visited, the sewers have become an ideal refuge for the worshippers of the forbidden Cult of the Lionhead Spider."
"I found a way to reach the Salamandra hideout in the city sewers."

&lt;/infobox&gt;Oren (alternatively "Temerian oren") is the official unit of currency in Temeria and the kingdom's vassal states and territories.
In 1252, the exchange rate was 6 orens to every Novigradian crown, and in August 1267, 100 orens exchanged to 9 Nilfgaardian florens.
By 1272, the value of the floren had plummeted to one oren to a crown, and one floren to three orens.

The oren is still the currency in ", which is rather strange given the fact that a good deal of the game takes place in Aedirn, which uses the mark. The Collector's Edition of the game includes a metal replica of a Temerian Oren.

The oren is no longer the main currency in "The Witcher 3". Instead, the crown takes its place. May sometimes be referred to as gold or money or coin. During Geralt's journey throughout Temeria he may sometimes acquire a few orens from looting various containers or corpses. These will be kept in his inventory like an ordinary item and may be exchanged for crowns at the Vivaldi Bank in Novigrad for a one-to-one conversion. In the "Blood and Wine" expansion, orens may be exchanged for crowns at the Cianfanelli Bank in Beauclair.

&lt;/infobox&gt;A Game of Dice is another quest which spans most of the game, but it is not a primary quest, despite being unavoidable. You can earn a few orens as you go.
Walkthrough.
Geralt finds his first starter box of dice just outside Haren Brogg's place in the Outskirts, in Chapter I. As the witcher is making his way through the village, he comes upon some bandits who are harassing a dwarf, Zoltan. Once they have been taken care of our hero finds the curious boxes on the corpses of the recently deceased ruffians. He asks Zoltan about them and the dwarf teaches him the basics of dice poker. After that, he is on his own.
The ultimate goal is to beat King Foltest, a legendary poker player. In order to do so, Geralt needs to start from the bottom of the "food chain": beat three novice players, then four professional, then three sharpers before reaching the top of the food chain, the king.
Novice Players.
 
Professional Players.
 
Sharpers.
 
Phases.
A Game of Dice.
I got my hands on a box of dice. It looks like dwarven handiwork. Is there a story to it? "I need to find someone who can tell me more about these dice".
Zoltan Chivay.
I learned that the dwarf named Zoltan Chivay can tell me more about dice poker. "If I meet Zoltan, I should ask him about poker."
Learn about poker from Zoltan: Zoltan Chivay introduced me to the fascinating world of dice poker, almost drowning me in information. You know what they say: you have to try it to know if it fits... I'll play a game or two. "I learned the basics of dice poker. It's time to play."
Learn about poker from the elven convict: The elven convict asked for a favor, and in some situations you just shouldn't refuse... As a result, I learned the basics of dice poker and inherited a set of dice.
The Basics.
I played Zoltan. It was educational, I think I know how it works now. I wonder if I can make any money playing... "I know poker basics. time to put them to use."
The First Few Games.
I've learned the basics of poker. After talking to Zoltan, I find myself itching to try my luck against a professional. "I should try to find professionals to play poker with."
Going Pro.
I played some of the best players and did rather well. Even Zoltan had to admit it. Only sharpers for me from now on. "I should find some sharpers to play poker with."
The Sharper.
I played the best and did well. Enough of this searching for opportunities. Now others can seek me out to play... "I wonder if anyone can outplay me at poker..."
The Legend.
I played dice poker with the king. The fact that your opponent can have you decapitated adds spice to the game. Our duel will become legendary. "I'm a poker legend." (1000 XP)

A Restless Ghost is an optional quest in Chapter II which Geralt can take if he speaks with a widow outside the Vizima cemetery.
Walkthrough.
One fine day, around noon, Geralt notices a distraught woman standing outside the cemetery gates. It seems that the widow, Hildegard Zollstock, is being haunted by the ghost of her recently deceased husband. Worse still, he is spreading vicious gossip about her and ruining her reputation. She mentions that she would be willing to pay the witcher to deal with her little problem, discretely.
 
The witcher agrees. He then asks her when and where he can collect his payment for a job which will no doubt be swiftly and well done. She insists on meeting him only outside the graveyard, away from prying eyes and only at noon. He grudgingly accepts her conditions.
Geralt decides to check in around midnight, at the same location. As expected, he finds a wraith, presumably "Mr." Zollstock indeed busily shouting unsavoury comments about his wife. Although the ghost is not initially hostile, the witcher is unable to make him stop slandering his better half so a fight ensues. The wraith is dispatched.
The following day, at noon, Geralt arrives outside the graveyard and collects his payment from a rather minimally grateful Hildegard.
Phases.
The Husband's Ghost.
Hildegard asked me to deal [with] the case of her late husband. His ghost is said to appear in the cemetery at midnight. I have to send him into the beyond. "I have to go near the cemetery at midnight and send the ghost into the great beyond."
Payment.
I sent the ghost of Hildegard's husband into the beyond. I have to see the widow about my payment. I will find her at the cemetery at noon. "I have to see the widow to collect my payment. I'll find her at the cemetery at noon." (500 XP)
The Money.
The woman wanted to cheat me, but I got my money in the end. (200 + 2000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;A Mysterious Tower is one of the most important quests in Chapter II. It is given to Geralt by Kalkstein, the alchemist.
Walkthrough.
There is an abandoned tower decaying in the middle of the swamp which seems to hold many secrets. It is of particular fascination to Kalkstein, who is willing to pay anyone 1000 to get inside it. But getting inside is not an easy feat, one must gather ten sephirot and place each of the ten in its corresponding monolith in the swamp.
The Sephirot
Phases.
The Books.
I promised Kalkstein that I would get more information about the mage's tower in the swamp. Two books are of particular importance: Ain Soph Aur and The Secret Gates. Very old publications as they are, they might be difficult to find. The dwarf had "The Secret Gates" and I'll have to look for the other one among some old people interested in history. "I have to find two books for Kalkstein."
"Note:" 500 XP can be had by talking to the locals about the tower.
Antiquarian.
The dwarven antiquarian hinted at where I might find the books I need. Golan Vivaldi owns "The Secret Gates" and he might also have a copy of "Ain Soph Aur". "I should see Vivaldi about the books I need."
If Geralt did not sell the weapons:
I witnessed the arrest of Golan Vivaldi. It is too bad - I hoped he would help me find one of the books for Kalkstein - after all, he is a dwarf. Perhaps I should come up with a way of breaking him out of prison. "Perhaps I should devise a plan of breaking the dwarf from prison."
I managed to release Vivaldi from prison. Now I can visit him and ask about the book for Kalkstein. "Now I can visit Vivaldi at his house and ask about the book for Kalkstein."
If Geralt sold the weapons: &lt;there is no actual phase entry in this case, Geralt can simply find Vivaldi at his home if he chooses&gt;
The Secret Gates.
I got hold of "The Secret Gates", I need to study the book thoroughly. "I should read the "Secret Gates" carefully."
Ain Soph Aur.
I got hold of "Ain Soph Aur", I need to study the book thoroughly. "I should read the "Ain Soph Aur" carefully."
The Tower History.
I got acquainted with the history of the tower in the swamp. That knowledge, combined with information taken from "Ain Soph Aur", should satisfy Kalkstein. "I collected more information for Kalkstein."
The Sephirot History.
I read the Sephirot history. This information, supplemented with "The Secret Gates" should satisfy Kalkstein's expectations. "I collected more information for Kalkstein."
Information for Kalkstein.
I retrieved the books Kalkstein asked me for. Sharing new information with him can pay off. "Sharing new information with Kalkstein can pay off."
Sephirot.
I presented Kalkstein with the results of my quest and got one Sephirah. Now, following the clues from the books I need to find the nine remaining Sephirot and place them on the right obelisks in the swamp. "I need to find the nine remaining Sephirot and place them on the corresponding obelisks in the swamp."
"Note:" Not all of these phases will appear. Which ones do is dependent on when Geralt receives the "three sephirot drop" from the statue of Melitele. You will only "see" six of these, do not worry about it:
Keth'aar.
I received the last Sephirah from the detective. "I must place the Sephirot on the monoliths and enter the tower." (1000 XP)
The Sephirot are in Place.
I placed all the Sephirot on the obelisks and the tower is open. I need to inform Kalkstein and collect my reward. "I can now enter the tower."
Opening the Tower.
I did what Kalkstein asked, placing all the Sephirot on the obelisks and opening the tower. Kalkstein paid me my reward as agreed. "I completed that task. The mage's tower is open." (1000 + 2000 XP)

The Rat is an optional quest in Chapter II which Geralt can undertake for Coleman. It involves clearing some ghosts out of a house for the dealer.
Walkthrough.
Geralt meets Coleman at The Hairy Bear, in the back room. When he asks if Coleman has any work for a witcher, the latter admits that he does (only if Geralt has updated quest to the part where he needs to visit the warehouse at midnight, otherwise he will not offer the quest). He needs a house cleared of ghosts which are wreaking havoc inside. The witcher accepts and promptly heads over to the address supplied by the dealer.
Once inside, he is greeted by two wraiths. He quickly dispatches the wraiths and returns for his reward, only to find that Coleman is nowhere to be found. Asking around the inn a bit, the innkeeper tells Geralt that Coleman can be found on the Dike collecting transports in the evening, granted that the witcher share whatever he could learn about Coleman.
As soon as the witcher set foot on the Dike, he caught Coleman chatting suspiciously with one of the city guard. Knowing well how dangerous these witcher bunches can be, it didn't take much of a convincing for Coleman to share the reason why he is here: He is the informant of Vincent Meis, and has been helping him dismantle Salamandra!
With that information, the quest approaches its end with the final decision for our hero: give Coleman's secret away to the innkeeper for some gold, or not?
Phases.
A Ghost Story.
I promised Coleman I would check out the so-called "haunted house". I need to go there and see if there is some kind of threat and eliminate it if necessary. "I must go to the haunted house and see if there is any real threat. If yes, then I should eliminate it."
Ghosts.
Amazing. Those really were ghosts. Well, time to go back and see Coleman about my money for the job. "It's time to go back and see Coleman for the payment." (500 XP)
The Dike.
Coleman is nowhere to be found. Luckily, the bartender told me Coleman can often be seen on the Dike and simultaneously warned me not to do business with him. I'm supposed to come back later, the innkeeper wants to know what Coleman's up to. "I must go to the Dike and see Coleman."
Snitch.
I met Coleman on the bridge. It turns out he's Vincent's rat. That's a very useful piece of information... I need to go to the innkeeper who will be very glad to pay for the denunciation. But do I really want to expose Coleman? (100 + 500 XP)
Not so nice path: Coleman won't snitch on anyone anymore. I gave him away to the innkeeper, who in turn works for Ramsmeat. (500 )
Nice guy path: Coleman's secret is safe with me. Vincent should appreciate it.
Decision.
Coleman's case solved. "Coleman's case solved." (1500 XP)

 &lt;data source="id"&gt;&lt;label&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Defending Kaer Morhen is the very first quest of the game and it spans the entirety of the Prologue. It is the game tutorial. In this quest, our hero Geralt of Rivia learns (or re-learns) to use a sword, fight, cast signs, brew potions and skin monsters. He learns the basics of what he "can" do and gets a taste for what he "could" do. All this as he and his fellow witchers try to fend off an attack on Kaer Morhen by the nefarious Salamandra.
Walkthrough.
After being found, unconscious in the woods outside Kaer Morhen, Geralt is taken back to the fortress and nursed back to health. The witcher is just beginning to get his bearings when the fortress is attacked by a bloodthirsty gang led by at least one mage and a notorious outlaw known only as the "Professor" seeking riches from the 50 bounties placed on the Witchers' heads.
Lambert is the first to notice that something is wrong. He cautiously makes his way to the main gate of the keep where he is met by the first wave of the attack. He fends off several of the raiders, but realizing that there are quite a few more, he retreats to warn the others of the attack.
Realizing the immediate danger, Vesemir assesses the situation and takes charge. He presses Geralt into service, telling him to grab a sword from one of the training forms and help fend off the assault. The Witchers, with the help of Triss, manage to hold off the onslaught long enough to reach the gate to the upper courtyard, but to combat the raiders, the witchers must get past a closed gate to the inner courtyard.
Vesemir orders Geralt to get to the winch and open the gate by using the back way through the tower. As he works his way along the battlements, he encounters multiple enemies grouped alone or in pairs. Reaching the tower, he stops short just in time to avoid falling into the pit which has replaced a large portion of the former tower. He runs up the remaining stairs, triggering a collapse that kills multiple pursuers and cuts the remainder of them off.
Finally reaching the upper courtyard, a few more bandits attempt to stop Geralt as he progresses, but he finally defeats the raiders guarding the winch and opens it, allowing his beleaguered allies to enter the inner courtyard. Triss then collapses the entrance to keep their attackers out, allowing for a short breather in the fighting.
The group learns that the Professor has killed at least 17 people and is wanted in several of the Northern Kingdoms. Triss has heard of the mage, Savolla, but does not have very much information other than the fact that he is mad.
On Vesemir's orders, Leo and Geralt run into the keep to protect the lab holding the famed witcher mutagens. They work their way through the keep, fighting though multiple groups of enemies. They find the lab only to see it being ransacked by the Professor and the mage and their path blocked by a magical barrier. When the mage collapses the stairs out, the Witchers have no choice but to continue into the Crypt of Kaer Morhen.
Leo then suggests that Geralt clear the side passage so that they can advise the others of what has happened. Leo explains that he can not clear it himself because he broke his hand training and can not form the Aard sign. Worse still, Geralt can not remember the Aard sign, so Leo proposes they go to the circle of elements and see if that jogs the witcher's memory. Thankfully, it does, so they return and Geralt clears the passage to the main keep.
At this point, Geralt is faced with a choice. He can help Triss save the lab, or help Vesemir and the other witchers fight the frightener.
Triss: Triss, Leo and Geralt go head inside the keep. Geralt takes on and kills Savolla. Triss goes on ahead to try to save the lab. Leo and Geralt catch up to an injured Triss who warns them that the Professor and an even more powerful mage are in the lab.
Vesemir: Geralt and the other witchers take on the frightener and kill it. Triss then teleports in, wounded and advises them that the Professor and an even more powerful mage are in the lab.
Meanwhile, the nameless mage has already escaped through a magic portal with the witchers' secrets, leaving the Professor behind to "clean up". Some typical bad guy posturing and then Geralt sets out to kill the Professor, but so does Leo, and less expertly so. The Professor spies his opportunity and fells Leo with a single shot from his crossbow. He then makes his own exit through the magic portal, leaving Geralt to tend to the dying young man.
As nothing can be done for Leo, Vesemir tells Geralt to rest. Afterwards, Geralt makes his way back to the main hall to help Lambert, triggering the quest A Potion for Triss. Afterwards, the group meets at Leo's funeral pyre, and decides to split up to search for the men behind the attacks.
Tips.
When fighting Savolla, take out the henchmen powering his shield quickly to counter Savolla's high damage output. Quick style can take out the henchmen quickly, and then Savolla is open to attack. Be knowledgeable about Savolla's ability to teleport as well to effectively fight him.
Notes.
Siding with Triss: Geralt finds a sapphire on Savolla's corpse. Later, in Chapter I at the Merchants' bridge, he faces the Salamandra only, no Armored hound. This means that only two pieces of red meteorite ore and one blue can be used to forge a new sword at the end of Chapter I, but siding with Triss seems to net a greater XP reward (Quest + Kill XP) than siding with Vesemir (though I can not find any evidence of this in the quest file). Killing Savolla is worth 390 XP.
Siding with Vesemir: After the fight with the frightener, Vesemir gives Geralt a piece of red meteorite ore, which enables the forging of a three-red-meteorite sword at the end of Chapter I, which is the best "damage-dealing sword" of the meteorite swords. Also in Chapter I, at the Merchants' bridge, the witcher faces an Armored hound, in addition to the Salamandra. Killing the Frightener is worth 390 XP, and this is very easy, as your fellow witchers can not be defeated and you only need to make the bell and cauldrons resonate (activating the cauldrons with Aard and the bell manually so fast that they vibrate simultanously) and then be in time to deal the death blow while all the other witchers are also attacking it. It is an easy spot for grinding as you can stay in the hole in the wall and kill Salamandra as long as you like, and also looting them, if the frightener is positioned far enough.
Phases.
A Sword.
I must remove the sword from the training form. "I need the sword that's in the training form."
The First Sword.
I need to help the witchers kill the bandits! "I need to attack the bandits!"
Assault on Kaer Morhen.
The other witchers and I managed to kill the bandits. Though I lost my memory, I'm certain of one thing: the bandits were after me and my friends. I should follow Vesemir, the oldest and wisest of us all. "I should follow the witchers."
The Gate is Shut!
The bandits have closed the gate to the Upper Courtyard. We are cut off from the keep. I need to lift the gate. Vesemir suggested that I follow the fortress walls to the tower. "I must get to the courtyard, climb the stairs and run along the top of the wall to the tower. When I arrive in the Upper Courtyard, I can try to open the gate from inside."
Opening the Gate.
I disposed of the bandits guarding the gate. Now I need to open it. "I must open the gate."
Preparing to Fight.
We're safe for now. Vesemir told me to drink the potion he gave me and to check the fortress interior. "I must drink the Thunderbolt potion and explore the fortress interior."
A Potion.
I drank the Thunderbolt potion. Now I need to enter the fortress and find the underground laboratory. I should pass through the main hall before descending the stairs. "I drank the Thunderbolt potion. Now I need to enter the fortress and go to the underground laboratory."
The Aard Sign.
One of the bandits is a mage. He cut off our way out. Leo will lead me to the Circle of Elements, where I can learn the Aard sign, a telekinetic spell that will help me clear the exit. "I must follow Leo and learn the Aard Sign."
The Circle of Elements.
I learned a Sign called the Aard. I can use it to remove the stones blocking the passage. "I should use the Aard Sign on the stones blocking the exit."
Leo perished at the hand of the Professor, the bandits' leader. I need to rest and then explore the fortress. I should make sure Triss and the other witchers are all right. Any surviving intruders - well, I'll make them regret Leo's murder. "I must explore the fortress, make sure the others are allright!"

&lt;/infobox&gt;
A Potion for Triss is a quest in the Prologue which serves as Geralt's first alchemy lesson.
Walkthrough.
Triss has been wounded in the attack on Kaer Morhen and, ironically, she can not heal herself. So, Geralt must prepare a special potion just for her, but he will need some help. Lambert initially gives him a shopping list of ingredients: White Gull and Calcium equum. These are upstairs in the keep, with the White Gull being located in the armory at the end of the hallway, and the Calcium equum can be found in a chest through the first open door on the left side of the hallway.
The witcher heads upstairs and, one by one, dispatches the bad guys. Once finished, he heads back to Lambert to see what is next. Lambert tells him that Vesemir has some other ingredients and information, so Geralt goes off to see Vesemir in the dining hall.
Vesemir gives Geralt some celandine and a quick lesson on skinning monsters, then sends him off to collect the claw of the frightener they killed during the assault on the fortress. Now everything seems to be in place but there is an important item missing: the formula. Lambert obliges and gives him the formula for the potion.
Our amnesiac hero then brews the potion, and brings it to Triss. She manages to take the potion and when she has recovered, and since they can not really reminisce about old times, they decide to make some new memories. Cue the soft lights.
Phases.
A Potion for Triss.
Vesemir told me to prepare a potion for Triss, who is wounded. Lambert is watching over the sorceress in the main hall. He'll give me further instructions. "I need to see Lambert in the main hall of Kaer Morhen and find out how to brew the potion."
Gatecrashers.
Lambert will help me brew the potion. First, I need to bring him a mineral from the evening hall on the upper floor and some alcohol from the armory. I must also kill any bandits I encounter on my way. "I need to get a mineral and some alcohol to Lambert, killing any bandits I encounter along the way."
The Mineral.
I found the mineral Lambert mentioned. "I found the mineral."
Alcohol.
I found the alcohol Lambert mentioned. "I found the alcohol."
Ingredients.
I gathered all the ingredients and killed all the bandits. I should talk to Lambert. "I've done all that Lambert asked. I should talk to him."
Bandits.
I disposed of all the bandits who were still inside Kaer Morhen. That probably puts an end to the attack. " I killed all the bandits."
The Formula.
Lambert taught me how to prepare the potion for Triss and advised me to speak to Vesemir. "I need to speak with Vesemir."
Skinning.
I learned how to skin monsters. Vesemir told me to find the frightener's carcass in the courtyard. I need to carve a claw from the beast's corpse. "I need to go to the courtyard and remove a claw from the frightener's carcass."
Alchemy.
I have all the potion ingredients. I need to find Vesemir, then start meditating to prepare the potion. The witchers said they'd give me more ingredients if I fail." I should find Vesemir, meditate and prepare the potion."
To Triss.
Success! The potion is ready, I need to take it to Triss' room in the tower. I can get there through one of the rooms on the upper floor. "I should take the potion to Triss' room on the upper floor."
Stay around for sex: The potion I prepared helped Triss - fortunately... The sorceress is recovering quickly... It's lucky she survived. I sense we were more than acquaintances some time ago... "Triss has recovered. I wish I could remember why that's important to me." (1000 XP) (5000 XP enhanced edition)
Head straight to the funeral: The bandits who attacked Kaer Morhen shouted the word "Salamandra" - probably the name of their organization. I won't let Salamandra get away with attacking the witchers. I'm a witcher myself. I'll avenge Leo's death and recover the secrets stolen from Kaer Morhen. "I aim to avenge Leo's death and punish those thieves called Salamanders, who stole the witchers' secrets." (4000 XP) (8000 XP enhanced edition)

Foltest

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
Foltest was the king of Temeria, prince of Sodden, sovereign of Pontaria and Mahakam as well as the senior protector of Brugge and Ellander. He was the son of King Medell and Queen Sancia of Sodden, making him a member of the Temerian Dynasty.
Sancia's royal connection with Sodden turned the principality into a vassal state and Ekkehard began paying tribute to Temeria after the death of Gutram. The king's Royal Council in Vizima included the sorceresses Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, as well as Fercart of Cidaris, Willemer the priest, Bronibor and Hereward of Ellander.
Biography.
Rise to Power.
Foltest was a wise and handsome monarch. As with his predecessor, he was not fond of his grandfather, Hugo of Rivia. Upon his accession to the Temerian throne, he demanded that Hugo's portrait be removed from the throne room and had a habit of "leaving Hugo out" of the family genealogy. Foltest devoted plenty of time to lauding his great-grandfather, Griffin, as he was known to speak warmly of "Grandmama Bienvenu" and "Great-grandmama Clarissa". He tended to be highly evasive of any questions regarding family lineage.
Although unmarried, many rumors about Foltest's romantic status circulated. From an early age, the then-prince created great scandal in the royal court by having an affair with his own sister, Adda. After ascending to the throne, he was to marry Adda and make her his queen, mortally offending King Vizimir II of Redania, who had arranged for Foltest to marry his daughter Dalimira. Adda died soon after the birth of their daughter, however, and the marriage never eventuated. The cursed child — possibly accursed by the courtier Ostrit, who was in love with Adda, but perhaps by Foltest's mother — died shortly after birth, or appeared to, until she emerged as a striga seven years later. The monster was so dangerous that Foltest was forced to move his residence elsewhere. The beast, however, remained a threat to all citizens living nearby. Foltest and his advisors at summoned a multitude of magical professionals or Knowing Ones. While most only offered a multitude of ways to kill the monster, one told of a possible ritual which could reverse the curse: sleeping within the striga's sarcophagus till the third crowing of the cock. As no one at the time could succeed, Foltest kept the striga alive while arbitrarily sending for mages and sorceress who might know how to reverse the spell.
Lifting Adda's curse.
In 1252, the witcher Geralt of Rivia was taken before Foltest as he believed he could lift the curse on Adda. They discussed the contract and arranged a reward of 3,000 orens, though they considered other options that Geralt could take, such as killing the striga, Foltest pleaded that Geralt simply cure it.
Later Foltest went and visited Geralt, discussing three last matters: what process the witcher would go through to lift the curse, what he should do if he needs to defend his life, and what state Adda would be in if she survived. Geralt explained how he would lift the curse and then went on his way to the old palace and eventually succeeded.
The affair between Foltest and his sister rendered him ineligible as a royal bachelor because any potential union would be tainted by the scandal. However, Foltest did not remain celibate for long. During the Second Northern War, he was secretly in love with the Baroness La Valette. It is widely rumored that both the Baroness' younger children, son Boussy and daughter Anaïs, are not the children of the old baron La Valette, but the progeny of Foltest. Adda the White was officially regarded as the successor to the Temerian throne, but the girl was clearly impaired and disabled.
Northern Wars.
In 1263, during the First Northern War, Foltest travelled with the Temerian Army to Lower Sodden, where under the united leadership of King Vizimir II of Redania, a great battle was fought and won against the invading Nilfgaardians.
The war crippled the Temerian economy, as over the next few years, a surplus of cheap Nilfgaardian goods started entering the kingdom. These goods competed too highly with local artisan prices, and so Vizimir II of Redania introduced "ius stapulae" to Novigrad, blocking all merchandise routes, and looking for Temerian and Nilfgaardian wares to seize and re-sell within the city, hoping it would prevent the same issues that Temeria's economy was suffering from. Foltest responded by issuing the law in the cities of Vizima and Gors Velen, knowing he couldn't close the southern borders, preventing the movement of Nilfgaardian goods, as it would anger the Merchant's Guild.
In 1267, he was summoned to Hagge by King Demavend III of Aedirn, along with the other leaders of the Northern Kingdoms, Vizimir II, Meve, Henselt. They discussed Emhyr var Emreis's invasion never ending, and the idea of a counter-attack. After the topic of the Scoia'tael came up, Foltest vowed to clear them from the lands of Temeria and Sodden within six months. While the other leaders believed Foltest had been searching for Ciri, as he wished to marry her to control Cintra, Meve knew about his relationship with Maria Louisa La Valette. The group quickly realized if Emhyr were to marry Ciri, they would permanently lose Cintra to her royal blood, so they silently agreed she needed to die. Foltest returned to Vizima and sent messages to his vassals to collect soldiers for the army, preparing for the second war. 
Foltest next travelled to Maribor, where in the city he received news delivered by Aplegatt from Demavend about Aedirnian and Lyrian soldiers awaiting orders to attack the Imperials and begin the war. Foltest responded by calling off the attack, until the Grand Mage's Conclave on Thanedd was finished, as plans could change, and believing Ciri dead, also called off the search for her. By June, he had his quartermasters commission boat-smiths to build him an armada, and launched them along the Brugge and Sodden west coast in embarkment and disembarkment drills.
The next month, after the beginning of the war and the fall of Aedirn and Verden, knowing Temeria couldn't muster a force to support Demavend or themselves against Nilfgaard, Foltest signed a peace treaty with Emhyr. Due to the Thanedd coup, and his newfound allegiance to Nilfgaard, Foltest exiled his court mages, including Triss Merigold and Keira Metz. He then offered support to Francesca Findabair, the newly appointed queen of Dol Blathanna, on the promise she would stop aiding the Scoia'tael.
"The Witcher".
In the original game, we hear about the king far in advance of any actual meeting. There is talk in the streets which suggests that the monarch is "away", but his specific location is never indicated. King Foltest only arrives in Chapter V, in the midst of the raging conflict in the streets of Old Vizima between the Scoia'tael and the Order of the Flaming Rose.
Prior to this point, he was away and had left others to govern in his stead: Velerad for instance, and, as we find out later, Thaler.
 "King Foltest is the ruler of Temeria. He inspires both fear and respect in his subjects. Foltest rules with an iron fist; he is decisive and hot-headed. Under his rule Temeria has become the most powerful of the Northern Kingdoms."
 "The king left the city. Theoretically, Burgomeister Velerad is to rule in his stead. In practice, the decisions come from an entirely different source, which causes chaos in the city."
 "Foltest returned to Vizima and began restoring order right away. He decided to put an end to the chaos and punish the culprits. It turned out that the king had a job for me, and my deeds influenced his plan."
 If Geralt kills the striga:
 "I spoke to Foltest about his daughter's death. It was a difficult conversation. If this stern man had one weakness, it was Adda."
 If Geralt lifts the curse:
 "I spoke to Foltest about freeing his daughter from the curse. Adda is the apple of her father's eye, so I definitely lifted his spirits, though the stern ruler showed no emotion."
Journal entry.
Having survived one assassination attempt at the hand of a mysterious killer thanks to the timely intervention of Geralt of Rivia, the king keeps Geralt nearby as he regards Geralt as a sort of "good luck charm". At the start of the game, Foltest is leading a civil war against the Baroness La Valette to claim his bastard children. He is eventually assassinated by the Kingslayer and Geralt is accused of the crime. One of Foltest's most trusted agents, Vernon Roche, assists Geralt in finding the Kingslayer. Leaving no lawful heirs, Foltest's assassination plunged Temeria into the chaos of interregnum. The threat of a full-blown civil war between the nobility and the last remaining bastard child and her supporters.
In the game, Foltest has changed significantly, his clothes and face are completely different and is mostly focused on the design and art of the character - he appears more regal, colorful and distinctive. He only briefly appears (relative to the story) in the tutorial missions as flashbacks when recalling the events to Roche.
"In retrospect, His Royal Majesty King Foltest was certainly an exceptional persona when compared to the other crowned heads of the time. This King of Temeria, Prince of Sodden, Sovereign of Pontar and Mahakam, and Senior Protector of Brugge, Angren, Riverdell and Ellander was a firm and decisive ruler - as, I suppose, one should expect from someone so abundantly titled. He was the kind of man who, when hit, made a sound suggesting he was forged of steel and not molded of bird dung. Being unmarried, he led a rather casual private life. In his youth, while still a prince, Foltest strove to demonstrate what he was capable of, and he proved capable of much. The love affair he had with his own sister, by whom he fathered his eldest daughter Adda, is widely known, as is his later affection for Baroness Mary Louisa La Valette. Both relationships bore heavy consequences, so to speak, and in both instances Geralt found himself stuck in the middle of the resulting mess."
"Foltest most certainly still harbored feelings for his former lover and decided to save the children that were the fruit of this affair. He feared they would otherwise become trump cards in the game of politics, tools of intrigue. Once Foltest made a decision, no one and nothing could stand in his way."
"The deaths of the great and powerful of this world do not always befit their lives. The blow was so unexpected that even the witcher failed to react in time. A dagger's blade ran across the throat of Foltest, ruler of Temeria, cleanly slitting it, and his blood flowed out onto the floor of the temple solar. Thus died one of the most powerful kings of the North - at the hands of an assassin in the garb of a monk."
"Scroll 1: Foltest seemed the ideal ruler. Intelligent, generous, industrious, and – according to all accounts – devilishly handsome. Yet, none are free of fault. Especially kings..."
"Scroll 2: In Foltest's case, his failing was excessive amorousness. Indeed, the Lord of Temeria, Pontar, Mahakam, and Sodden could not control himself in matters of the flesh."
"Scroll 3: If only Foltest had limited his conquests of love to bored widows and adventurous townswomen... Alas, he preferred to chase after priestesses, the wives of his allies, and the daughters of friends... Even his own sister."
"Scroll 4: Foltest's uninhibited lust proved his ultimate downfall. The King of Temeria – a celebrated hero of the Nilfgaard wars – did not fall at Sodden or Brenna. No... Rather, he perished in the midst of civil war against a former lover and their bastard children."
"Chest 1: Unlike the other kings of the North, Foltest did not hate the Elder Races. On the contrary, he spoke fluent Elder Speech and was a connoisseur of elven poetry and dwarven ale. Nevertheless, he fought against the Squirrels with unbridled ruthlessness. He sentenced every prisoner of war to the breaking wheel, considered sympathetic humans as spies, and confined all non-humans to segregated city quarters. "After all," he thought, "reasons of state sometimes demand sacrifices.""
"Chest 2: Foltest claimed dozens of wartime victories – often against overwhelming enemy forces. What was his secret to success? An analytical mind? Swift and decisive action? The king himself used to say that he owed his many victories to an excellent memory. For he knew the names of all his officers – even many of the rank-and-file. He understood their strengths and weaknesses, thus enabling him to assign the right person to any task. As a result, most in Foltest's service considered themselves friends to the king. And all were prepared to give their life for him."
"Chest 3: King Foltest was not particularly religious as rulers go. He did not observe fasts nor venture out on pilgrimages. In fact, often without a second thought, he had broken all religious edicts concerning one's private affairs in the alcove. Nevertheless, he spared no expense when it came to erecting new temple and even agreed to a tithe, proving a significant drain on the royal treasury. Yet, to what end? Although he doubted the existence of the gods, he recognized that the power of their priests was very real. Any attempt to limit their influence might provoke their holy wrath..."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Won't Hurt a Bit is an optional quest which is given to Geralt in Chapter III by Zahin Schmartz, a dwarven dentist and a collector of teeth who moves to the Temple Quarter.
Walkthrough.
The dwarf dentist, Zahin Schmartz moves into Raymond Maarloeve's - the recently deceased private investigator - house in the Temple Quarter at the beginning of Chapter III. He collects the teeth of various creatures and is willing to pay for additions to this strange collection. The witcher agrees to keep an eye out for any interesting specimens and to bring them back to the dentist.
The dentist can be hard to find on occasion. He is either at his place of residence, on Merchant Street chatting up the local purveyors of wares or, in Chapter V he is in the abandoned executioner's tower in Old Vizima.
Phases.
The Beast's Teeth.
The dwarven dentist has discovered his collector's bent. He's interested in all the teeth I can find, though he's most intent on monster teeth, of course. "The dwarven dentist is buying monster teeth."
Barghest Teeth.
The dwarven dentist bought the barghest skulls from me, teeth and all. "I'm sure I can find some more interesting specimens for the dentist."
The Jaw.
The dentist was also very interested in the cemetaur jaw. "I'm sure I can find some more interesting specimens for the dentist." (150 + 1000 XP)
Fleder Fangs.
The dentist was glad to add the fleder fangs to his collection. "I'm sure I can find some more interesting specimens for the dentist." (100 + 1000 XP)
Devourer Teeth.
The devourer teeth became a part of the dentist's collection. "I'm sure I can find some more interesting specimens for the dentist." (125 + 1000 XP)
Alp Fangs.
The dentist was ecstatic when I showed him the alp fangs. "I'm sure I can find some more interesting specimens for the dentist." (150 + 1000 XP)
The Beast's Teeth.
The dentist bought the teeth of the Beast, even though they're fairly common. "I'm sure I can find some more interesting specimens for the dentist." (50 + 1000 XP)
The Boxer's Tooth.
The dentist was so happy he almost cried when I brought him the tooth of that famous boxer. Apparently, it's unique. "I'm sure I can find some more interesting specimens for the dentist." (250 + 1000 XP)
A Reward.
The dentist rewarded me for contributing so much to his collection. "I received my reward from the dentist." (2000 XP)

Trying to interrogate the Crown Witness being held by the City Guard begins Geralt's investigation into Salamandra in the Temple Quarter. This quest is given to the witcher by detective Raymond Maarloeve when the two first meet.
Walkthrough.
Having successfully conquered the Beast of the sewers, Geralt emerges from from the cesspool and immediately spies the shingle for the local private eye: the one Siegfried mentioned earlier. He decides to go in and have a chat with the gumshoe.
After a very informative exchange, Geralt learns that the City Guard has captured one of the men with the Salamander badges and is currently holding him somewhere in the Temple Quarter. He decides to try to interrogate the witness himself, but that means finding the prisoner first. He heads off to the jail to speak with Vincent or Jethro, who should be able to shed some light on the matter.
The guards, however, prove less than helpful and our hero must find a way to coax the location from one of them. Jethro is the obvious choice, given his "Fisstech". You can find Fisstech on the bodies of bandits, you can buy it from Coleman at the Hairy Bear Inn, and you can even make it yourself by mixing vermilion and quebrith with a strong alcohol.. Geralt uses this fact to good effect, supplies the jailer with a little treat, and voilà! The prisoner is being held at the hospital. The guards at the hospice also need a little encouragement, not to mention the right lighting. The witcher must go back and "speak" with them later, around midnight, but few orens later, there is a result. Suddenly there is a sound from the prisoner.
All he manages to say is "Aghhh... Kalkstein... He...", when a band of Ramsmeat's men barge in and all heck breaks loose. Geralt springs into action and it does not take long for things to get back to some semblance of order, but the prisoner has lapsed back into unconsciousness, so no further information can be obtained from him.
Interesting events though, it seems Kalkstein and Ramsmeat both have a stake in this prisoner. What could be going on?
Phases.
Prisoner.
Raymond told me that the city guards caught a member of the Salamanders. I need to get to him and learn as much as I can about the Salamander. I should ask Jethro the prison guard where he is held. "I need to find out where the Salamander is being held. I should talk to Jethro."
The Captain.
Vincent avoids all conversation about the prisoner. That won't get me anywhere. Maybe Jethro will be more talkative. "I'll press Jethro for more information on the prisoner."
The Bribe.
Jethro knows something and wants fisstech in exchange for the information. "I have to get some fisstech for Jethro."
Coleman is alive: I have some fisstech for Jethro now. "I need to bring Jethro some fisstech."
Coleman is dead: Coleman is dead. I have to find another source of fisstech for Jethro. Someone at the inn might know something about this. "I have to visit the inn and ask about possible sources of fisstech."
It is going to be difficult to find fisstech after Coleman's death. They say some Salamanders have it with them. "They say some Salamanders have the drug with them."
I managed to get some fisstech for Jethro.
Prisoner in the Hospital.
In return for fisstech, Jethro told me the guards transported the prisoner to St. Lebioda's Hospital. I might be able to speak with him there. "I must speak with the prisoner being held at the hospital." (500 XP)
The Hospital Raid.
The prisoner was in hopeless condition, all he managed to do was whisper the name of Kalkstein. We couldn't proceed with the conversation as Ramsmeat's thugs raided the hospital. The name of Kalkstein is some lead, I wonder what Raymond is going to say about it. "Ramsmeat's men assaulted the hospital. I need to speak with Raymond."
The Interrogation.
After questioning the witness we had two promising clues, leading to the alchemist Kalkstein and the bandit Ramsmeat. "We have two leads: Kalkstein and Ramsmeat." (3000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Witchers' Secrets is the framing quest for "The Witcher". It spans the entirety of the game. The cold-blooded murder of Leo, a young witcher trainee, compels the witcher to seek revenge in addition to finding the secrets taken from the keep during the opening battle. Along the way, Geralt will learn a lot about himself and his prey.
Walkthrough.
During the battle at Kaer Morhen, a young witcher trainee, Leo, is callously killed by the Professor. This act outrages the witcher and he swears to bring the culprit to justice. This quest takes him first to the outskirts where he locates the first of three Salamandra hideouts. This spans all of Chapter I.
In Chapter II, Geralt moves on to the city of Vizima proper, where he finds two more Salamandra hideouts, one in the sewers and one in the restricted area of the Trade Quarter in his relentless pursuit of his goal: crushing Salamandra completely. At the end of Chapter III, he finally uncovers the location of the Salamandra base and infiltrates it, and finishes off the Professor. One down, one to go.
Along the way, he discovers that Princess Adda is also involved with Salamandra. Just as he emerges from the base, things come to a head and our hero is very nearly executed when he is "greeted" by the princess and a squadron of arbalesters. It is only by the good graces of the sorceress, Triss Merigold that he is teleported away and manages to avoid a nasty fate.
Geralt then finds himself in Murky Waters for Chapter IV, which while Salamandra-free, does provide some more information about the organization. This comes about when our hero finally finds the long-lost witcher, Berengar. It seems Berengar "spent some time" with Salamandra, more than once in fact. The rest of the time Geralt spends in Murky Waters is really unrelated to the primary quest. But, as far away from Vizima as Murky Water seems, the unrest reaches the sleepy village and by the end of the Chapter, Geralt is on his way back to the city with one more headache to contend with: outright fighting in the streets between the Scoia'tael and the Order keeping him from his friends who might provide more information.
In Chapter V, after much trudging back and forth between Old Vizima and the swamp cemetery, the witcher gets the break he needs when the king himself provides some valuable information about the location of Salamandra's leaders: the Old Manor. It is at the Old Manor that Geralt has his final encounter with Azar Javed, but as it turns out, he was not the mastermind. After killing the mage, our hero finally discovers who is really behind the madness: the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, Jacques de Aldersberg.
There is a final showdown between the witcher and the Grand Master which takes place in the Ice Plains, a dreamscape of Aldersberg's making. Only after the witcher has killed the madman does he finally find the stolen witchers' secrets. End of quest.
Phases.
Stolen Secrets.
I'm setting out to search for the stolen secrets and to avenge Leo's death. "I must find the stolen secrets and avenge Leo's death."
Earning the Villagers' Trust.
I was lucky enough to track down a man who wears a salamander-shaped brooch in a settlement outside Vizima. The locals may know something about the organization. I must win their trust to learn where I can find the members of Salamandra. I should talk to the most prominent people in the community. "I should talk to the most prominent residents of the Outskirts and discover where I can find the Salamanders."
The Salamandra Hideout.
I was right to trust my gut feeling - the villagers knew the location of the Salamandra hideout. It seems the bandits extorted protection money from the locals and carried off their children for some unknown purpose. They're not based in the Outskirts, but I sense I'm going to face a large and well-organized group. For now, I must penetrate the Salamandra hideout in one of the abandoned houses. "I must enter the Salamandra hideout, located in one of the abandoned homes."
The Gang Leader.
I interrogated the leader of the gang from the Outskirts and gained some new information. The man mentioned someone named Azar Javed. I should remember that. Alvin said the bandits often mentioned Vizima, so that is where the trail leads. "I must follow the Salamanders' trail to Vizima."
The Private Eye.
The Salamanders are holed up somewhere in this city. Siegfried advised me to contact a private investigator. Good idea. I know monsters, but I could use a professional to help me with this investigation. "I've decided to see a private investigator."
Vizima Confidential.
I've begun an investigation into the identity of the Salamandra leader. I'm working with detective Raymond, who could help me learn who is working with Azar Javed. Maybe his associates will lead me to the man himself... "I'm pursuing an investigation in Vizima that should lead me to Azar Javed."
Azar Javed.
Azar Javed, the Salamandra leader, was masquerading as the private investigator. He defeated me when we finally faced each other, but this isn't over. The Salamanders will regret that they ever provoked the witchers. I must destroy Salamandra, which clearly feels at home in Vizima. "I must destroy Salamandra, which clearly feels at home in Vizima."
Salamandra in the Temple Quarter.
I successfully located and destroyed the Salamanders' lair in the Temple Quarter. The organization has lost control of the fisstech trade, losing its funding in the process. "I successfully located and destroyed the Salamanders' lair in the Temple Quarter."
The Salamandra Camp in the Swamp.
I successfully located and destroyed the Salamandra camp in the swamp, cutting off the organization from the resources it needs to produce fisstech. "I successfully located and destroyed the Salamandra camp in the swamp."
Destroyed Cells.
I destroyed the Salamandra cells in Vizima. It turned out their influence ran deep. Now I need to find their leader and bring this matter to an end. Azar is probably has the stolen secrets. I need a break of some sort, a new lead, but in the meantime I should tend to other tasks. "I need to find Azar Javed. I should tend to other matters and hope for a break."
Fighting Monsters.
I killed the monsters bred by Salamandra and defeated the Professor, who took part in the attack on Kaer Morhen. I sense that Salamandra was only a cover-up for Azar Javed's other plans. That son of a bitch escaped, taking the stolen secrets with him. I must track him down, avenge Leo and recover the witchers' secrets. "I must find Azar Javed. He has the witchers' secrets."
Second Wind.
It seems that the king's daughter Adda was supporting Salamandra. I managed to destroy the organization in Vizima and to kill the Professor, but in doing so I enraged the princess. Triss saved my life, teleporting me out of the city. I'll stay away from Vizima until Adda calms down. Meanwhile, my allies will continue to work. Time to catch my second wind. "I've dismantled Salamandra in Vizima. I should wait until Adda calms down and catch my second wind."
Return to Vizima.
Time to return to Vizima and to deal with Azar Javed once and for all. I'll need to find my friends in the city. They should help me locate the last Salamandra hideout. "It's time to return to Vizima and deal with Azar Javed once and for all."
Get Azar Javed.
The Salamandra boss is hiding at the Old Manor. With the Professor dead, it's time to punish the other leader of the assault on Kaer Morhen and to recover the witchers' secrets. "I should go to the Old Manor and deal with Azar Javed."
The Salamandra Master.
Azar Javed and the Professor are dead. Though I destroyed the laboratory where the Salamanders were creating mutants, I failed to recover the witchers' secrets. I must get to the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, Jacques de Aldersberg. He created Salamandra and he is holding the secrets of Kaer Morhen. "To retrieve the secrets stolen from Kaer Morhen, I must find the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose in Vizima."
The Cloister.
My final confrontation with the Grand Master is at hand. I must reach the Cloister, where my enemy hides. It will be a rough passage through the war-torn city. "I must reach the Cloister of the Order and settle the score with the Grand Master."
The Grand Master's Vision.
The Grand Master wields powerful magic, though he has trouble controlling it. He has drawn me into his vision of the Ice Plains, which the civilized world will turn into with the coming of the White Frost. I must overcome Jacques de Aldersberg's vision, climb the peak where I will find him. "I must overcome all obstacles and climb the peak to confront the Grand Master."
Witchers' Secrets.
The Grand Master is dead and I have recovered the witchers' secrets. Yet as they say, every ending marks the beginning of something new... "Something ends, something begins..." (10000 XP)

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Fistfight is one of the first quests that Geralt "receives". Basically, after his first fistfight, the witcher decides that he needs practice, lots of practice, and so begins the quest.
Walkthrough.
In "The Witcher", there are several quests that span the entire game, this being one of the most noteworthy. In each Chapter (except the epilogue) of the game, at the local tavern, Geralt is given the opportunity to challenge the local reigning fistfight champion for a chance at the "Title", winning other trinkets and orens along the way. He must defeat four fighters before facing the Champion, in his cave in the swamp cemetery.
This final fight does not come easily, the champion will not relinquish his title after a single defeat. Geralt must beat him twice in a row before he can claim the title for himself. He also gets the boxer's tooth as a trophy.
Phases.

The Rematch.
I defeated the Champion in a fistfight. He acknowledged my victory but said he's entitled to a rematch. Next time, I'll knock him out. "The Champion and I are scheduled for a rematch."
The Champion of Champions Defeated.
I defeated the Champion for the second time, knocking his tooth out in the process. He acknowledged my victory. "The Champion acknowledged my victory." (5000 XP)
The Champion of Champions.
I defeated the Champion of Champions. That makes me the world's best fist fighter. "I'm now the world's best fist fighter." ( + 6000 XP)

This article will catalogue Easter eggs in "The Witcher". The developers have stated that there are a fair number of them.
"A virtual Easter egg is an intentional or feature in an object such as a movie, book, CD, DVD, computer program, or video game. The term draws a parallel with the custom of the observed in many western nations."
"This practice is analogous to hidden signature motifs such as including himself in his murals or 's legendary ." (Wikipedia)
Auditory Easter Eggs.
Note: Most of these are random events — when walk by a townsperson, he/she may utter something that will make you laugh. Their randomness makes it quite possible to miss them, though.

 &lt;data source="id"&gt;&lt;label&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Of Monsters and Men is the first major quest following the Prologue (which was essentially a game tutorial). It spans the entirety of Chapter I and introduces several major characters.
Walkthrough.
As Chapter I opens, we see a woman (Caroline) accompanied by a child (Alvin) walking through the outskirts of Vizima in the dark. They seem hurried and Alvin is tired, but Caroline will not relent - they "must" reach their destination. Dogs gather, seemingly hungry...
Caroline soon realizes that these are no ordinary dogs, and orders Alvin to run as fast as his feet will carry him - the Country Inn is near. Alvin barely reaches the palisade surrounding the inn, but Caroline is not so lucky - the guards close the gate, leaving her to the barghests.
Geralt has just witnessed Alvin's dramatic entrance and the barghest attack. He quickly dispatches the hounds, but the disturbances are not over yet...
Note: While killing the barghests, it is easy to accidentally attack the guards. While not catastrophic, this is best avoided - but even should it occur, Geralt/guard relations will return to normal after the battle.
Just when things seem to be calming down, Alvin's body glows, levitates and delivers a prophecy in an otherworldly growl. After this, the healer Shani may briefly mention Salamandra and the Reverend to Geralt. She looks after Alvin for the time being, hoping to find a local woman who'll take the orphan boy in.
Through the Reverend, Geralt will gain access to other influential residents of the Outskirts; it will also be the Reverend who divulges the existence of the nearest Salamandra hideout. So Geralt must complete several tasks, first placing lights at five local shrines of the Eternal Flame. This must be done at night; the Reverend believes this will stop the barghest attacks.
Geralt should seek out Abigail, the local witch. He finds that she has taken in young Alvin (whom both he and Abigail suspect is a source). Here Alvin will again prophesize, under the influence of a certain tea - but for this tea Geralt must bring Abigail five petals, either purchased from a Viziman herbalist or gathered via Herbalism and proper study.
After confronting the Salamandra in their hideout, Geralt finds Alvin, who leads him to a cave where Abigail is hiding from a village lead by the Reverend. She asks Geralt for help from the mob, who wish to lynch her, even offering sex for aid, leading to a possible sex card.
Regardless of what he says or does with Abigail, once Geralt leaves the cave, he is faced a choice with the mob, either siding with them and letting the witch burn, or siding with Abigail and leading the herbalist from the cave. Each choice leads to a different outcome.
Regardless of his choice, Geralt fights the Beast within an impenetrable circle of fire, endless barghests joining the fight until it is defeated.
If Geralt saved Abigail, she helps him fight. After killing the Beast, the Reverend leads his guilty party to stop you, initialting a fight.
If Geralt sided with the villagers, the Reverend's group helps Geralt fight, and afterwards the Reverend thanks him.
After the fighting, Geralt retrieves a pass and returns to Shani.
Phases.
The Beasts Beyond the Gate.
I must kill the creatures that attacked the woman and child before they slaughter everyone inside the palisade. "I must kill the beasts that attacked the woman and child". (500 XP)
The Good Shepherd.
When the Beast attacked, the boy was terrified. He went into a magical trance and uttered a prophecy. It seems the Outskirts have mysteries of their own. To fathom them, apparently I should see the Reverend. "I must see the Reverend if I want to solve the mysteries of the Outskirts".
The Holy Flame.
The Reverend asked me to slay the Beast. He believes that the Holy Flame should be lit in all the chapels around the village. I doubt that will help, but I've decided to do it, as a favor for him. I must visit the five chapels at night and light a flame in each. "I must visit the five chapels of the Eternal Fire at night and light a flame in each".
The Dying of the Light.
I lit the fires in the chapels but, as I expected, that didn't do any good. I should tell the Reverend he was mistaken. "Lighting the fires did not drive the barghests away. I should inform the Reverend".
The Witch.
I lit the fires in the chapels but that didn't help. The Reverend wants me to learn where the Beast came from. The local witch is his chief suspect. I should call on her. "I should visit the witch". (100 + 500 XP)
The Witch's Innocence.
The witch claims she had nothing to do with the appearance of the Beast, denying the Reverend's charge. "The witch says she is innocent".
White Myrtle Petals.
The witch Abigail claims she can learn more about the Beast if she can encourage Alvin's prophetic abilities by having him drink a magical potion. I need to bring her five measures of white myrtle petals. "I must bring the witch five white myrtle petals."
Myrtle Gathered.
I have the myrtle and should take it to Abigail. "I should see the witch again."
Brewing.
I brought the witch white myrtle petals. She needs some time to prepare the concoction. I should look around for other work. "The witch promised to brew the potion. I should return in a while."
Alvin's Prophecy.
Alvin's prophecy is clear. The Beast was born of human wickedness and evil. It will continue to haunt the Outskirts as long as those who have wronged others remain unpunished. Prophecies be what they may, Abigail decided to help me in case I need to face the Beast sword in hand. She gave me Berengar's notes, which may help me defeat the monster. It's time to report what I've learned to the Reverend. "I must see the Reverend, tell him what I've learned about the beast."
Waiting for a Solution.
The Reverend promised to deal with the Beast. It's time I did what I need to do and dealt with Salamandra... "It's time I dealt with Salamandra. There are some things I need to do..." (200 + 500 XP)
The Witch is Cornered.
I found the witch inside this cave where she's hiding from a mob of villagers who are out to lynch her. Apparently, she knew of the villagers' crimes but did nothing about them. I must go outside and pass judgment. "I must face the mob of villagers outside and pass judgment."
Killed the beast, let the reverend lynch Abigail:
"I passed judgment and killed the Beast. It was a hard fight. There's nothing keeping me here now. I must see the Reverend and get a letter of safe conduct that will get me inside Vizima. (300 + 2000 XP + Berengar's notes on the Beast if you did not get them from Abigail earlier)"
Killed the beast, let the reverend lynch Abigail:
"I passed judgment and killed the Beast. It was a hard fight. There's nothing keeping me here now. I must see the Reverend and get a letter of safe conduct that will get me inside Vizima. (2000 XP + Berengar's notes on the Beast if you did not get them from Abigail earlier)"
Killed the beast and saved Abigail:
"I passed judgment and killed the Beast. It was a hard fight. There's nothing keeping me here now. I must see the Reverend and get a letter of safe conduct that will get me inside Vizima."
"Abigail thanked me for saving her. It's time I was on my way. I should go to the inn and get Shani as we agreed. I must go to the inn and get Shani. (2500 XP)"

 &lt;data source="id"&gt;&lt;label&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Berengar's Secret is a quest which spans through almost the entire game. Our hero must first find and then question this errant witcher whose path seems to cross Salamandra's far too often.
Walkthrough.
Not long after Geralt wakes up at Kaer Morhen, he begins his quest to regain his memory. This entails mainly speaking to anyone and everyone who seems to know him and getting what information he can to piece together a picture of his missing past. One of the first things he learns is that there are very few witchers left, but not all of them are at Kaer Morhen. Notably one is absent, Berengar.
Throughout Chapters I and II, the witcher follows the trail left by Berengar but the latter manages to stay one step ahead, or maybe he is just dead? By the end of Chapter II, Geralt is convinced that he is, but in Chapter III, he gets news that Berengar is indeed still alive, but where is he? His path has clearly led him to Salamandra, but what then?
It is only in Chapter IV that Geralt finally finds Berengar and they get a chance to speak face to face, but it is not easy. It seems that the errant witcher cares not one whit how much trouble our hero has gone through to find him. He prefers to remain "lost" as it were and has no desire to talk about his motivation or actions. It takes a lot of prodding in the form of repeated visits before Geralt gets all the information out of him.
At the end of Chapter IV, things come to a head and the two witchers confront each other on Black Tern Island. At this point, Geralt can either challenge him to a duel (a certain fight to the death) or forgive him and move on.
If Geralt forgives him, Berengar gives him what information he has on Salamandra and takes his leave but returns to help the witcher during his final battle with Azar Javed at the Old Manor. If they duel, obviously our hero is the victor and must get the information from Berengar's remains. In addition to the notes he would have gotten if they parted peacefully, he also finds Berengar's medallion, a powerful amulet which is useful against Azar Javed in the final battle between the witcher and the mage.
Phases.
Berengar.
My Kaer Morhen companions and I are not the only remaining witchers... Apparently, Berengar is also still alive. He stays away from the brotherhood and wasn't at the fortress when it was attacked. Where was he then? And who is he? If I ever meet him, I'll be certain to ask at least those questions. "Vesemir mentioned another 'graduate' of Kaer Morhen - the witcher named Berengar."
"This phase only happens if Geralt somehow missed being told about Berengar during the Prologue."
Berengar in the Outskirts.
Another witcher recently visited this godforsaken hole near Vizima. His name is Berengar and he was not among us at Kaer Morhen. What's more, he disappeared instead of facing the Beast. I don't know him, but I can say that he's already made my life difficult by giving the villagers a reason to dislike us witchers. "I hope to meet witcher Berengar, here or in Vizima."
"This phase only happens if Geralt spoke to Vesemir in the Prologue about other Witchers."
Berengar Abandoned the Outskirts.
A witcher named Berengar was here in the Outskirts before me. He promised to kill the Beast but then ran off leaving nothing but a bad impression. I'd like to meet him, talk to him. Maybe he knows something about the stolen secrets. I'm sure the witcher managed to get into the city. "Maybe Berengar can help me find Salamandra. I'm sure he found a way into the city."
Pursued by Salamandra.
Berengar was captured by the Salamanders but managed to escape. The organization interrogated him. What did they ask and what did he betray? Only the witcher himself can answer that. Berengar probably fled to Vizima, I should look for him there. "Berengar fled Salamandra and probably found a way into Vizima."
The Witcher's Sword.
The guards got their hands on a witcher's sword. It probably belonged to Berengar... I need to talk to the fence who owns the place where the sword was found. Strange, but I find myself following in the footsteps of this mysterious witcher. I doubt he would ever part with his sword voluntarily, so he may be in trouble... again. "I must talk to the fence who had the witcher's sword."
Berengar's Equipment.
A fence named Thaler has Berengar's equipment. I should ask around, find out who sold Berengar's things to Thaler. "I should ask around - in the city and its environs - to find out how Thaler got his hands on Berengar's things."
Swamp Dwellers or Coleman's Death + The Brickmakers.
("these only happen if you allowed the Scoia'tael to take the weapons during Strangers in the Night OR spoke to Ramsmeat about Berengar"):
Coleman is dead, killed with weapons that I put in the hands of the Scoia'tael. So much for that lead. "Coleman is dead. I'll have to look for others who might have met Berengar."
Berengar's things were found by brickmakers. The items were covered in blood and the surrounding area showed signs of a fight. I fear Berengar may be dead. I'll look around near the clay pits, maybe I can find some clues. "I should ask the swamp dwellers about Berengar."
Clay Pits.
Vaska, the leader of the brickmakers, told me that Berengar spent time around the clay pits. "I should look for Berengar near the clay pits."
Berengar's Death.
I followed the trail of Salamander corpses and found the place where Berengar made his last stand. By the look of things, he sold his life dearly. When I see Vesemir again, I'll have to tell him of the death of another one of our caste. "Berengar is dead. Sad tidings for Vesemir when I see him again."
Berengar is Alive!
Berengar is alive. The bad news is that he was probably captured by Salamandra. "I have yet another reason to destroy Salamandra."
A Traitor.
It seems Berengar is working for the Salamanders, though unwillingly. the Professor sent him out to find Alvin, so I'm sure our paths will cross. "Berengar was sent to find Alvin. I'm likely to find him when I find the boy."
The Encounter.
I found Berengar at last. I have many questions and even more doubts... "I found Berengar. I should speak with him."
Working with Salamandra.
Berengar is a bitter man. He told me he hates the witchers and is miserable as a mutant who is resented by humans. He also admitted he worked with the Salamanders, partly because he sees no difference between their methods and those of the witchers. "Berengar admitted that he worked with Salamandra. He should pay dearly for it... "

The Monster of the Lake is one of nine optional trophy quests. It is obtained by killing Nadir, a drowned dead for whom the Royal huntsman is offering a reward. Only one trophy quest, The Beast of the Sewers, is not optional, making a total of ten.
Walkthrough.
Nadir, a drowned dead can be found just east of the mill near the Miller's Gate, but remember that these drowners only come out at night. "The Monster of the Lake" first sends his minions (his drowner buddies) after you, so group style is advised. After getting rid of his friends, you can then concentrate on the drowned dead himself. He will not really put up a fight. Equipping the Red ribbon talisman will prevent the other drowners from attacking you, if you need a little extra help. Bring his head to the Royal huntsman and the 200 are all yours.
Although you can meet the Royal huntsman again in Chapter III, this quest cannot be completed after Chapter I.
Phases.
The Monster of the Lake.
I killed a monster which was feeding at the lakeside. I should extract proof from its body and go to see a lawman, who will pay me for completing this assignment. I should talk to the Royal Huntsman. "I should take the trophy to the Royal Huntsman and collect my reward."
I collected my....
I collected my reward for killing the drowned dead. I can probably negotiate a higher reward if I kill more monsters and bring back trophies. "I should deliver any trophies I collect off dead monsters to the Royal Huntsman." (200 + 1000 XP)

King of the Crypt is one of nine optional trophy quests. This quest is obtained by killing Ozzrel, a nasty alghoul haunting the crypt in the Outskirts. The Royal huntsman is offering a reward. Only one trophy quest, The Beast of the Sewers, is not optional, making a total of ten.
Walkthrough.
After he finishes the quest to earn Mikul's trust, Geralt remembers that the Royal huntsman had mentioned a particularly nasty creature in the crypt. Strange, a few ghouls are not "that" nasty. So he decides to pay a second visit to the crypt.
As Mikul had mentioned earlier, some of the guards had taken it upon themselves to do a little grave-robbing, fully expecting to find some treasure there. Their excavations have conveniently removed the boulders previously blocking the nether regions of the crypt, but their bodies, strewn along the floor are a testament to the futility of their mission.
The witcher decides to explore the rest of the crypt. Besides a few more ghouls, he finally encounters an alghoul named Ozzrel. Now this "is" a nasty creature. It is a tough battle, but our hero prevails as we knew he could, takes the head of the monster as a trophy and heads off to see the huntsman for the promised reward.
Phases.
King of the Crypt.
Royal Huntsman and claim my reward. " I need to get this trophy to the Royal Huntsman and claim my reward."
A Trophy.
I gave the trophy to the Royal Huntsman and he gave me my reward. "The Royal Huntsman rewarded me for that trophy." (200 + 1000 XP)

The Barghest Contract
"Brave man urgently needed! Whoever brings me 10 barghest skulls will receive 100 orens."
"Abigail, herbalist"
Walkthrough.
The quest should not be a problem at all. You will find barghests just everywhere in the Outskirts at night. Look for rabid dogs or do the quest She's No Early Bird - both are guaranteed locations for barghests. After you have collected ten skulls, see Abigail for a nice XP boost and some coin.
Phases.
Barghest Skulls.
Abigail, the local herbalist, will pay cash for barghest skulls. I should see her as soon as I collect the number she needs. "I must collect ten barghest skulls for Abigail."
Loot.
I have enough barghest skulls to collect my reward. I should see Abigail. "I should see Abigail and collect my reward."
Payment.
Abigail paid me for the barghest skulls. Job done. "I received my reward for the barghest skulls." (100 + 2000 XP)
Failed.
I doubt anyone will want these barghest skulls now. These barghest skulls are useless now.

Walkthrough.
Drowners are always easy prey. They are very susceptible to stun attempts, so use your Aard sign often. If you wear a red ribbon Talisman (which can be bought from Abigail) they will not attack at all, but you will have to chase them around to kill them. Talk to the Reverend to collect your reward after you have collected three drowner brains.
Phases.
Drowner Brains.
The Church of the Eternal Fire has offered a reward for killing drowners. The brains of the monsters must be presented as proof of their demise. "I need to collect three drowner brains for the Reverend."
Loot.
I've collected enough drowner brains. Time to find a priest of the Eternal Fire. "I should see the Reverend and collect my reward."
Payment.
I delivered the drowner brains. Job done. "I received my reward for the drowner brains." (100 + 2000 XP)
Failed.
I doubt I'll have another chance to complete this assignment. I lost my chance to collect that reward.

Walkthrough.
You will encounter ghouls while doing the quest for Mikul. Since there are not many ghouls in Chapter I, be sure to unlock the Ghoul bestiary entry before venturing into the crypt. After you have finished Mikul's quest there is a new passage in the crypt where you encounter more ghouls and a named alghoul. Every night there is also a ghoul which feasts on some corpses at the abandoned houses north of the cave. Collect three vials of ghoul blood and return to Kalkstein who resides at the local inn.
Phases.
Ghoul Blood.
Kalkstein the alchemist will pay for the blood of three ghouls. "I must collect the blood of three ghouls for Kalkstein."
Loot.
I have enough ghoul blood. It's time to see Kalkstein and collect my reward. "I should see Kalkstein and collect my reward."
Payment.
Kalkstein is using the blood in some of his research. Interesting... In any case, job done. "I received my reward for the ghoul blood." (100 + 3000 XP + Basics of Alchemy)

<doc id="1988" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1988" title="The Witcher technical information">
The Witcher technical information

"The Witcher" is built on 's Aurora Engine, so it is inherently moddable. This article will contain information on these two technical aspects of the game.
Game Engine.
"The Witcher" is powered by a new version of the BioWare Aurora Engine, modified for a single-player experience. A number of changes have been introduced to the original BioWare Aurora Engine, and some of them are described below.
World Visualization.
In BioWare's Aurora Engine, the world is designed exactly as it was envisioned rather than utilizing a tile-based system. Because of this, the visuals are claimed to be unique and rich in detail. All the environments are created in and then exported into the game engine.
The CD PROJEKT RED's version of the engine supports lightmaps, generated in 3D Studio Max. Shadows generated this way are claimed to look more realistic and are faster performance-wise.
This is a special tool that enables to paint the environment using custom textures, with the purpose of saving time and promising a more natural look than ordinary mapping.
New realistic skybox and water effects were added to the engine.
Rendering.
All the in game and tool set rendering is done using DirectX9, and the engine now supports many different shaders (water effect, bump mapping, environment mapping, etc.). Additionally the whole rendering system has been unified and a new light manager was added.
Other Changes.
Other important changes include the following: motion-captured animation, physics effects, new mechanics and combat system. There are also many other modifications, such as introduction of portals, additional graphical effects (glows, advanced dynamic shadows, blurs).
Modding.
"For the main article, see :Modding."
Shortly after the 1.3 patch was released, CD PROJEKT RED provided the community with the D'jinni Adventure Editor to modify the game with. This works in a similar fashion to the Aurora toolset, however the community has since levelled some criticism at the developers for not providing sufficient aid in its use as there have been a wealth of new functions and D'jinni is not as intuitive and helpful as Aurora which would mark errors and provide a list of commands.
Patches.
The latest version of the game is v1.5. The Patch 1.5 is not a cumulative patch, like earlier patches. It requires a v1.4 installation of the game.
Load and Save Times.
The most frequent criticism about the game's performance is about the load times. Try these tips to help lower them.
In addition, the game autosaves each time something changes in the Journal (added, updated or completed quest). Given the time it takes to save, many have asked that a future patch include a setting to disable autosave.
The time required to display the save or load screens apparently increases dramatically as the number of saves increases. Hence, it is recommended that the number of savegames be kept under control to avoid this. The saves are stored in &lt;samp&gt;My Documents\The Witcher\saves&lt;/samp&gt;.
Many tweaks were made to reduce load times and change how autosave is handled in the Patch 1.2. Most notably, when going from a large zone (Vizima Temple Quarter for example) to inside a building (a house for example) and back, the load time will be much shorter than when initially loading the large zone. The game simply keeps the large zone cached in memory because it is almost certain that the player will return to it. This has helped considerably in reducing load times when exploring Vizima, for instance.
Cutscene Performance.
It has been noted that even though most cutscenes use the game engine itself (rather than being pre-rendered), they often run very slowly.
Troubleshooting.
TAGES Issues.
The game uses the copy protection system, which has been found to conflict with disc image drive emulators and react similarly to presence of and drivers in the system, leading to a number of occasions where the copy protection system has prevented users from running legitimately purchased copies of the game.
These problems can be usually avoided by uninstalling the TAGES driver with the official installation program and then starting the game (which will automatically install the appropriate driver version).
How to remove TAGES? (while using patch 1.5).
Given that Patch 1.5 removes the copy protection scheme known as TAGES from the game executable, here is how to remove TAGES from your system.
First of all you must establish if TAGES is needed by any other games that you have installed, unfortunately we can not do that for you, and no list of TAGES protected games was found by me (if you have such a list do share it so I can update this).
Presuming that you do not have any other game that needs TAGES, you can carry on, get the latest TAGES executable, for your Windows 32bit or Windows 64bit, from here, and run it.
You will get one of two possible dialogue windows:
If you have other games that use TAGES, and you did remove TAGES from your system, when those games are run you might get:
Remember that patch 1.5 removes the need for the TAGES code/files only from The Witcher.

CD PROJEKT

CD PROJEKT is a Polish video game publisher and distributor. It is best known for "The Witcher" franchise of video games developed by its studio division, CD PROJEKT RED.
History.
The company was founded in May 1994 by Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński. From the beginning their goal was to publish software in the Polish market on compact discs. The company became the first Polish publisher to publish software on CDs and for a long time it was the only company in Poland specializing in publishing computer and video games and educational software.
CD PROJEKT is also known in the Polish gamer community for being the first to publish fully translated international hit games, such as the "Baldur's Gate" saga (one of the first games fully translated into Polish, an event which became a milestone of computer gaming and publishing in Poland), "Planescape: Torment" (considered by many gamers as the best Polish translation of all times), both "Icewind Dale" games and many more. A recent major translation, widely covered by the media, was "Heroes of Might and Magic V". Most of CD PROJEKT's game translations feature well known professional Polish actors and celebrities, such as Piotr Fronczewski, Bogusław Linda, Małgorzata Foremniak, and many others.
In 2002, CD PROJEKT expanded to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where it began to distribute games in Czech translation.
On October 6, 2005, CD PROJEKT launched a platform called gram.pl (English: "i'm playing.pl"). It is a portal created for players looking to sell or buy new games, where a life-time warranty is provided with new purchases.
In February 2008, CD PROJEKT purchased the development studio . On July 10, 2008, CD PROJEKT launched (GOG.com), a distribution platform for purchasing classic, DRM-free computer games online.
In order to smoothly enter the stock exchange, CDP Investment (the of CD PROJEKT) was merged with Optimus, a public company with financial problems that were solved by acquiring CD PROJEKT. On July 25, 2011, Optimus S.A. officialy changed its name into CD PROJEKT Red S.A.
2012 saw further name changes in order to clarify the group's structure. On September 21, the original distributor abbreviated its name from CD PROJEKT to cdp.pl, following with founding new online shop for games, movies, and e-books with the same name. In November, CD PROJEKT RED S.A. changed name to CD PROJEKT S.A., leaving the name "CD PROJEKT RED" solely for the gamedev studio. In the same month, managers of cdp.pl Michał Gembicki i Robert Wesołowski bought the control from CD PROJEKT S.A., making the distributor independent from its former owners. In 2016 cdp.pl launched Klabater brand responsible for Indie game publishing and in 2017 it changed name to CDP, selling cdp.pl shop to Merlin Commerce Group.
As of 2020, CD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A., owned by Iwiński and Kiciński, and consists of:
CDP publisher remained independent from CD PROJEKT Capital Group. It bankrupted in April 2020.
CD PROJEKT RED.
CD PROJEKT RED is the development studio of CD PROJEKT, specializing in video games. Founded in 2002, it first produced "The Witcher", based on Andrzej Sapkowski's books, for a 2007 release. It is headquartered in Warsaw.
In July 2013, CD PROJEKT RED opened a new studio in Kraków to develop "two new smaller games approximately 20-hours in length". In July 2015, it was revealed that they were the two expansions for "", first called "Hearts of Stone" expansion and second "Blood and Wine" expansion, both announced on April 7, 2015.

Yennefer of Vengerberg, born as Janka on Belleteyn in 1173, was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.
She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), was a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Council of Wizards within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.

Early life and studying at Aretuza.
Born in 1173, Yennefer had a rough childhood from the moment she was born due to her congenital hunchback. Her father immediately detested her due to this deformity and blamed Yennefer's mother for it, claiming it was through her side, with mages and elven blood, not to mention her having had an abortion before, that caused the deformity. Her mother initially tried to protect Yennefer, believing it was by the will of the gods, but her father still struck Yennefer until one day he left them both for someone else. After this, her mother, upset that her husband had left, also began to beat her own daughter.
At some point, due to her magical potential, she was received in the Aretuza school for sorceresses, where rectoress Tissaia de Vries became her teacher and mother figure. During her training, Yennefer tried to kill herself by cutting both of her wrists, severing her tendons, though she survived. Tissaia claimed that the purposefulness of her attempt was the only thing that prevented her from feeling contempt for her weakness, and continued her training. In accordance with the sorceresses' tradition, any physical flaw, including her hunchback, was magically removed. Yennefer was a classmate Sabrina Glevissig, though later both feigned friendship with each other, and claimed privately to be the younger of the pair, taking offense at being called each others former classmates. She eventually passed her training and tests in 1186, at the age of 13, and graduated as a sorceress. Three years later, in 1189, she lost her virginity.
Meeting Geralt.
At some point, Yennefer set herself up in the town of Rinde and, ignoring King Heribert's rules that no magic users could stay in Redania, openly practiced her magic and provided her magical services to clients by staying with Novigrad's ambassador, Beau Berrant, thus granting her asylum from the law while in the ambassador's home.
One morning, a witcher intruded on her sleep, revealing himself as Geralt of Rivia and that he needed her assistance in healing his friend, Dandelion, who had been afflicted by a djinn. After an initially rough greeting where Geralt responded sarcastically to her questions, Yennefer agreed to heal the bard, but she secretly made preparations in hopes of capturing the djinn, after Dandelion makes his final wish. When Geralt tried to stop her from using Dandelion, her spell took hold of the witcher, charming him to do her will against those on the town council who were against her.
After Geralt is arrested, she has Dandelion, now awakened teleported out into town with instructions to make his wish to free Geralt. Yennefer tried to capture the djinn, but it fought her, destroying a good part of Rinde in the struggle, not knowing that the djinn's master was not Dandelion, but in fact, Geralt, who still held one wish. Geralt arrived to see Yennefer struggle with her spell, and he tried to stop her, leading them to fight one another. She got the better of him, and he revealed to her that he was the one with the last wish that could free the djinn. Geralt knew that the moment he made a wish, Yennefer would be too weak to contain the djinn and it would kill her. So Geralt saved their lives, by wishing their fates were tied together. Yennefer was grateful to the witcher, willing to bind himself to her, and the two began a relationship.
A year in Vengerberg.
Yennefer and Geralt lived together for a year in Vengerberg. Occasionally Yennefer would ask Geralt to escort her when she attended a meeting with her fellow mages, but he would turn her down, fearing how they would treat him. Eventually, Geralt left the sorceress, leaving her with feelings of bitterness towards the witcher.
Temple of Melitele.
Yennefer traveled to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander and spoke to Nenneke about a cure for her infertility. While she was at the temple, she spent time looking around for Geralt, and after discovering he wasn't there confronted Nenneke and ended up quarrelling with her, before leaving the temple.
The dragon hunt.
Yennefer took part in assisting in hunting a dragon, accompanying king Niedamir along with dragon hunters. The company was soon joined by Geralt, Dandelion, Dorregaray, Borch Three Jackdaws and his two Zerrikanian warriors, Tea and Vea. When she joined the group of hunters, Yarpen Zigrin threw insults at her, and she threatened him. The hunters told her that they planned to kill the dragon without the help of her spells, as they feared her magics could kill the dragon and thus entitle her to the reward instead of them. They also asked that she remind Niedamir of the proposal for the reward, and she assured them that he already accepted the proposal, against her advice. Before leaving the group, she told them that when they face the dragon, they'll regret declining her aid and beg for her help. Geralt followed Yennefer, and when they were alone, Yennefer revealed her anger towards the witcher, feeling hurt from him the last time they saw each other four years ago, and asked if he only took the quest to see her. He said he did so, and she said that they will pretend to be civil and friendly in front of the others but that they are through and that she has not forgiven him.
While traveling, Yennefer decided to give her opinions during a conversation between Geralt and Dorregaray. She told Dorregaray that, in opposition of his belief in preserving all living things, that dragons must be destroyed as they are true enemies of man because of their ability to wipe away an entire city with fire. Dorregaray insulted her, reminding her of her sterility and angered her. She advised Geralt to use common sense and he called out her argument, that if dragons didn't hoard treasure, no one would care to bother them, especially mages like her.
When the company reached a bridge, they had to hurry to cross as a landslide began and Geralt grabbed Yennefer when she fell from her horse. The two crossed the bridge until it collapsed, leaving the two hanging for their lives. While those up top argued to wait to assist until Yennefer fell, Eyck lowered an enchanted elven rope and they pulled the couple up to safety. The company continued, where they encountered a golden dragon, Villentretenmerth, warning them to depart. After Eyck was defeated in the duel against the dragon, Yennefer begged Geralt to kill the dragon because she said she needed it She heard her infertility could be reversed, but in exchange, she needed a golden dragon. But Geralt made no promises to her. After Niedamir abandoned the mission, Dorregaray declared to protect the dragon, and the company fought amongst themselves, with Yennefer using her magic on Geralt and Dorregaray, giving the hunters time to bind the witcher, sorcerer and bard. But when she tried to claim the dragon for herself, the hunters turned on her and tied her up as well. As the dragon dealt with the hunters, and confronting the local malitia, the group finally realized that it was protecting baby dragons, one which nuzzled up to Yennefer. She had Geralt free her, using Igni, and she used her magic against the villagers attack the dragon. After the fight, Villentretenmerth stopped Vea from killing Yennefer, declaring the killing to be finished and appeciates her and Geralt's help. He tells her that she and Geralt were meant for each other but nothing will come of it, though the romance between the sorceress and witcher had been reignited.
Aedd Gynvael.
Yennefer and Geralt together went to Aedd Gynvael, where she met her other lover, the sorcerer, Istredd. She and the witcher spend a night together and the next morning, she met and made love with the sorcerer. After Geralt met and spoke with Istredd, who asked Geralt to end his relationship with Yennefer, Geralt spoke with Yennefer that night, where she admitted she could not chose between the two men. After Istredd and Geralt agreed to duel, Yennefer sent a message to both the men, ending her relationship with both of them, rather than risk losing either of them.
Battle of Sodden Hill.
In 1263, she fought at the Battle of Sodden Hill alongside other sorceresses and sorcerers from the Brotherhood, but was blinded during the battle by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was later magically restored but she still bore the emotional scars.
After the Battle of Sodden Hill she became a member of the Council of Wizards. Later at some point, she travelled to the Gors Velen marketplace, where she saw and comdemned Yarpen Zigrin for his involvement in the dragon hunt.
Saving Dandelion.
In 1265, Yennefer travelled to Velen on the orders of Sigismund Dijkstra, where she hid under the great oak tree Bleobheris and watched Dandelion's concert. After the concert, noticing that Rience was following Dandelion, she followed them both along the road to a small town. She found Dandelion behind the brothel Mama Lantieri's, being attacked by Rience and two other thugs. She killed the two and sent a fire spell at Rience, burning the side of his face deeply, before he teleported away.
The two went into the local inn and had a meal over the discussion of recent affairs.
Training Ciri.
In 1266, after receiving a letter from Geralt, she traveled to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander to teach Ciri. Even though at the beginning the two of them didn't get along well at first, they later grew a mother-daughter bond. Yennefer first taught Ciri about magic and how to harness chaos. She also helped her with stopping her nightmares for a while, as well as controlling her breathing and pulse.
One night, Nenneke grew tired of Yennefer's training strategies, claiming she had no heart, as Ciri had spent the previous few days sick in bed, recovering from the intense training. This distance between Yennefer and Nenneke led to Ciri spending more and more time with the sorceress, and saw her friends much less.
In June 1267, she received news of the coming conflict with Nilfgaard, and revealed it to Ciri one day while the girl bathed. Yennefer decided they would travel to the magical school Aretuza so Ciri could learn in safety, and the sorceress could meet with the Conclave of Mages.
Traveling with Ciri.
The next morning, they left the temple to travel to Aretuza, first spending a night at an inn in Ellander, where Yennefer watched Ciri foretell the messenger Aplegatt of his death in a trance, before they left for Anchor in Temeria, their next rest stop.
They stopped in Gors Velen, the city most famous for being close to Thanedd. There, Yennefer visited Giancardi Bank and met up with Molnar Giancardi, who told her that people were attempting to access her account in the Vivaldi Bank in Novigrad. They then discussed the economic growths and downs and Molnar hinted that the northern kings might be preparing for war. Yennefer then carried out some bank transactions including sending money to the Temple of Melitele and Aretuza for Ciri's future studies. So she could discuss matters more privately with Molnar, Ciri was sent on the tour through the city with Fabio Sachs, during which she got caught by Margarita Laux-Antille and Tissaia de Vries, who thought she was a runaway student from Aretuza. After meeting up with Yennefer, everything was settled as they spent the evening together in the spa at The Silver Heron. They discussed mainly Ciri's future studies along with other gossip, until Ciri ran away to see Geralt in Hirundum. Yennefer followed her there, which led to her reunion with Geralt after almost 4 years.
When Ciri woke up the next day, Yennefer was in an orchard with Geralt arguing. They then made peace and forgave each other for their previous mistakes, and Yennefer invited the witcher and Ciri to the banquet on Thanedd.
Thanedd coup.
On the last night of the month, Yennefer was accompanied to the banquet in Aretuza by Geralt. For the first time, the witcher fully confessed his love for her at the beginning of the banquet, before they talked to Sabrina Glevissig, her girlhood rival from studying at Aretuza. They then spoke with Philippa Eilhart and Sigismund Dijkstra, and then finally Triss Merigold. After the Chapter and Council joined the banquet, Yennefer told Geralt that since the Battle of Sodden Hill she had been a member of the Council. She also harshly reminded Triss about them being back together, telling Geralt that she knew about them and didn't want to hear another word about it. She then left the witcher to talk with Tissaia and Francesca Findabair. Later that night in their room, Yennefer and Geralt made love, and he told her about his conversation with Vilgefortz.
During the night, the sorceresses and sorcerers allied with Nilfgaard were arrested by Philippa Eilhart and her accomplices. Yennefer's position was unknown, but she was presumed by many to be one of the traitors. She brought Ciri to the Garstang meeting on the orders of Tissaia. Ciri, who had been put into trance to act as a medium, served as a proof, for she couldn't lie in trance. She confirmed the truth behind the attack in Dol Angra, where Demavend had attempted to incite a war against Nilfgaard. However, as it'd been a technical attack against the Empire, Emhyr's troops answered back and began to push into Aedirn and Lyria. She then further revealed that King Vizimir II had been assassinated during the night. As dawn approached, a fight in Garstang erupted, after Tissaia freed the traitors. Ciri and Yennefer were attacked by an elven assassin while fleeing, whom Yennefer stabbed with a knife. They ran away, but needed to separate, so Yennefer told Ciri to go to Loxia and search for Margarita, for she would be safe there.
During the fight, Francesca Findabair used artefact compression on Yennefer to smuggle her off the island, before Rience could find her.
Lodge of Sorceresses.
Yennefer was kept as a jade figurine for 47 days before Francesca freed her. According to the Queen of Elves, Yennefer was widely searched for and it was safer for her to stay that way. Even though the artefact compression can be dangerous, Yennefer was alright. Francesca then told her everything that happened during the time she was compressed, including what happened to Geralt and Ciri. Yennefer was told that, because she was missing, everyone considered her to be one of the Nilfgaard traitors. Francesca invited her to join the Lodge and warned her to not act against the plan of the Lodge. She wanted Yennefer's word for it, but Yen didn't give it.
She teleported to Montecalvo with Francesca and Ida Emean aep Sivney. Many sorceresses, including Sabrina Glevissig, considered her Vilgefortz's ally and she faced much hatred from her former colleagues. She recognized Fringilla Vigo as the one who blinded her during the Battle of Sodden Hill.
After Philippa Eilhart introduced her plan to marry prince Tankred Thyssen of Kovir with Ciri to create northern monarchy that would oppose Nilfgaard, Yennefer told everyone about Ciri's life and powers. The sorceresses then digged into Ciri's true potential as the child of the Elder Blood. Francesca told them the story of Lara Dorren aep Shiadhal. Together they unearthed the generations of Elder Blood gene being passed on to Ciri.
The Lodge then proceeded to talk about Ciri's whereabouts, when Assire informed them that the emperor doesn't have a girl with the Elder Blood, therefore Ciri. The Lodge thought Ciri must had been captured by Vilgefortz. After this information Yennefer became terrified, because Ciri was either in Vilgefortz's captivity or went through the portal in Tor Lara and was presumably dead or irrevocably lost. She deeply regretted what she pulled Ciri into.
During a small recession, she briefly talked to Triss and Francesca, but it soon became clear to Yennefer that Francesca wouldn't let Yennefer talk to Triss alone, who she was hoping would help her escape from the castle to try and find Ciri herself. Realizing none of the sorceresses would help her out or blocked her from being left alone with those who would, Yennefer was left by herself eating oysters when she was approached by Fringilla Vigo. As the Nilfgaardian sorceress brought up their actions at Sodden Hill and what they did to each other, they found an unusual peace. Fringilla, knowing Yennefer was trying to escape, noted how it was dangerous to try and create a portal to get out of the magical blockade around Monteclavo and how the oyster shells they were eating could help create such a dangerous portal out, before casually remarking if they were friends she'd tell Yennefer not to do it, but they weren't friends so she was free to do whatever. Thanks to this information, Yennefer managed to teleport out of the castle.
In Skellige.
Her blind teleporting wasn't without some consequences, and Yennefer found herself caught in fishing nets as she teleported to where the oysters were from: right off the shores of Skellige. After a rude confrontation with the Skelligers who were fishing there, she was treated as a guest on the islands while she waited for Crach an Craite to return to discuss with him about Ciri. When he did arrive, he noted he planned to send her to Novigrad, to be judged for her supposed crimes, having believed she assisted Vilgefortz. Yennefer told him that she had no intention to sail to Novigrad, and risk being framed. She told him her intention to find and help Ciri, and reminded Crach that he made a similar vow to protect the princess. Trusting her words, he decided to help her. She went to Hindarsfjall to get the sacred diamond, Brisingamen, to use for her megascope, to communicate with others, as a way to allow herself to be bait and draw the attention of Vilgefortz.
With the crystal, she communicated to Triss as she wanted someone to know what happened to her if her next steps led to her death. However, she quickly realized something was wrong and confirmed that Philippa was in the room with Triss. Yennefer then realized that Triss had made up her mind and was loyal to the Lodge as Philippa took over the conversation, informing Yennefer they viewed her as traitor for escaping. When Yennefer then asked they at least clear her name if she should die in her attempt to find Ciri and inform Ciri of the truth, Philippa refused as it wasn't in the Lodge's best interests to do that. However, out of Yennefer's desperation to prevent any harm from happening to her adoptive daughter, Yennefer decided to leave behind clues for the sorceresses anyways should something happen to her in her search for Ciri.
Shortly after that, she then set sail with volunteers to the Sedna Abyss, including Crach's son, Hjalmar, as she'd learned someone had teleported there right after the coup and thus, likely a way to teleport to Vilgefortz's hideout. However, knowing how dangerous this attempt would be, she had all but a skeleton crew stay on another ship while she took the skeleton crew into the abyss itself. Hjalmar tried to go with her as he also wished to rescue Ciri, but Yenefer refused and threatened him to make him stay behind much to his ire. With that, Yennefer then headed into the abyss where an unnatural storm suddenly started and teleported the ship and everyone on it away.
Captured at Stygga Castle.
Yennefer's guess had been right though, and she was teleported straight to Stygga Castle, Vilgefortz's main hideout and who promptly captured the sorceress in his own attempt to lure Ciri to him. For two months, she was imprisoned in the castle dungeons, before being moved to different chambers of the castle. When ever she was moved from the chambers, her route did not consist of any hints for her to use to escape, and she was shackled with Dimeritium, to prevent her from using magic. One day, Yennefer was brought to meet Vilgefortz, who tried to convince her of Ciri and Geralt's death, to no avail. When she was brought back to her room, she was met with Leo Bonhart, who told her of how he captured Ciri and forced her to fight and kill, and how he killed a few witchers. Despite these claims, Yennefer told him he would be no match for a real opponent such as Geralt, taunting the bounty hunter, and he tried to rape her. However, despite her limitations, Yennefer was able to fend him off and stabbed him in the cheek with a fork she took from the dining table, from before.
Reunited with Geralt and Ciri.
After Ciri was captured, Yennefer was being taken by the castle lackeys, when Geralt, having arrived at the castle, found her, freeing the sorceress. Though weakened, Yennefer joined Geralt in his assault on the castle, to rescue Ciri. The two confronted Vilgefortz, and the couple fought the mage. Yennefer was eventually overcome by the sorcerer, who began to break her bones, but he was interrupted by Regis, freeing the now severely wounded witch. While she was down, Regis was killed, but Geralt was able to kill Vilgefortz, due to the medallion given to him by Fringilla creating an opening to win the fight. She came to, and with Geralt's help, they left the room, and they were finally reunited with Ciri, meeting up with her in the castle, and Yennefer embraced her. As the three were leaving the castle, they found the only exit blocked by Stefan Skellen and his gang. She followed Geralt and Ciri down the stairway to the exit, as they killed anyone who tried to stop them, and nearing the exit, both the three, and Stellan's gang were stopped by the Emhyr and his forces, who recently arrived. In order to hide his relation to Ciri and prevent any attempt to retrieve her, Emhyr gave Geralt and Yennefer a choice to die peacefully by slitting their wrists in the bath, and both of them agreed to it, seeing few options in their weakened states. They said goodbye to Ciri, and Yennefer made him promise not to hurt Ciri or make her cry, before he left the witcher and sorceress alone in the bath chamber to prepare for their end. The two spent, what they believed to be their last moments, making love. However, when they called for the guard for a knife to end their lives, they were surprised to find Ciri answering the door, saying everyone else had left the castle. Ciri told them that she cried terribly when she realized she would never see her foster parents again, and by doing so, it broke Emhyr's promise to Yennefer and he decided to let all three of them go.
The three traveled together stopping at Jealousy to find out what happened to the bodies of the Rats, whom Ciri joined for a time. They found out that a burial mound was made for them, and Yennefer implied that it was this act of decency spared the town from potential wrath. They travelled to Claremont, where Ciri destroyed the arena where she was forced to fight. They continued traveling through Ebbing, becoming figures of legend.
Facing the Lodge.
One night, Yennefer and Ciri were contacted with the Lodge. They demanded both she and Ciri come to them. Yennefer said she would not, nor could she, force Ciri to go but said she would see them, and asked them to let Ciri stay with Geralt a little longer, and she'd willingly act as hostage to insure Ciri would meet them later. Yennefer told Geralt she was leaving, and Ciri would follow later and they would all meet again. After visiting Toussaint with Geralt and rescuing Dandelion, Ciri joined Yennefer at Montecalvo castle, where they confronted the Lodge. The Lodge then told Ciri of their plans. Yennefer tried to cast her vote to allow Ciri to see Geralt and inform him of her situation, but the Lodge denied her the right to vote since she had refused to join them and had escaped. However, Philippa Eilhart voted in favor, allowing Ciri to go, Yennefer took Ciri to see Geralt again accompanied by Triss.
Farewell and peace.
Yennefer, Ciri, and Triss arrived at Rivia where Yennefer, knowing Triss's lingering affections towards Geralt, told her she would never have the witcher's love because she had chosen the side of the Lodge instead of Ciri. They soon found a riot had broken out in Rivia, and Ciri knew Geralt was in danger, and the sorceresses rushed to follow Ciri to Geralt. Yennefer was attacked by the crowd, but used her magic against them, causing them to back away, and Triss caught up, begging Yennefer that they should flee the city. Yennefer didn't listen, and continued into the city. She was knocked out by the crowd, but Triss returned and saved her, and the two sorceresses used their combined powers, causing hail to rain down, dispersing the mob. The two found Geralt, fatally stabbed, though still alive, and Yennefer tried to heal him, using any spell she could think, even if she knew he couldn't be helped with magic. She continued until the energy using magic had exhausted her, causing her to lose consciousness. Ihuarraquax arrived, and with it's help with Ciri's power, summoned a boat and Geralt and Yennefer were placed in the boat. Ciri went into the boat and sailed away, taking the couple to Malus Island, to find peace together.
Captive of the Wild Hunt.
Yennefer and Geralt lived together on the island peacefully in a house with an orchard and stopped keeping track of time. Both were presumed dead to the rest of the world, although ballads sung by Dandelion led some to believe they had married and lived in the happy isles. Eventually, the wraiths of the Wild Hunt came to the island, burned the house and orchard and took Yennefer captive, seeking to use her as bait to capture Ciri.
With Yennefer in tow, the Hunt traveled through different worlds and passed through Sodden, Cintra, and Angren, taking twenty-three others captive. The time was a blur of blood and fire, a wild chase across worlds. Determined to rescue her, Geralt pursued the Riders of the Hunt for over a year. With the aid of Letho of Gulet, Serrit, and Auckes, three witchers of the School of the Viper who joined him after he saved Letho from a Slyzard, he confronted the Wild Hunt at the Hanged Man's Tree in Nilfgaard on the Winter Solstice of 1270. Outnumbered by the Riders, the battle reached a stalemate, and Geralt proposed a deal with Eredin Bréacc Glas, King of the Wild Hunt, to trade his life for Yennefer's. Considering both suitable bait for Ciri, Eredin agreed without hesitation.
Alliance with Nilfgaard.
Left in the care of Letho, Serrit, and Auckes, Yennefer was seriously ill, feverish, and delirious, to the point that the witchers believed she would die. Although she recovered from the sickness, she was left disoriented and had no memory. Not wanting Geralt's sacrifice to go for nothing and aware that the headstrong, amnesiac sorceress would likely not survive long on her own, the four traveled the provinces of the Nilfgaardian Empire together. During their time together, Yennefer was a difficult companion, prone to outbursts. At one point, she attempted to seduce Auckes and drive a wedge between the witchers. Everywhere they went, Yennefer got into trouble and Letho, Serrit, and Auckes got her out of it.
One day, they were apprehended by the Imperial secret police. In Nilfgaardian custody, Yennefer was separated from the three witchers and questioned at length, though without any torture. Letho believed it was through her that the Nilfgaardians learned of the Lodge of Sorceresses. As she would not have informed on her fellow sorceresses consciously, he deduced that they used magical means to tap into her memories of the Lodge without her knowledge. Later, through the efforts of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis' mages, she regained her memory. While at the palace, Yennefer was closely watched by the men of Vattier de Rideaux, head of the Nilfgaardian Secret Service.
Yennefer was held hostage in a cell until the day that Emhyr came to her and offered to grant her release and free reign of the Imperial treasury in exchange for helping him locate Ciri, his daughter. Wanting to help Ciri, who she also regarded as her daughter, and aware that the vast power of the Emperor would be of great help to that end, Yennefer agreed. Judging that Geralt had escaped the Hunt and trusting that his witcher mutations would ward off any serious injury, she opted against seeking out her lover and spent the months that followed trying any means she knew to find their adopted daughter. Methods including locating spells, haruspicy, and geomancy all failed to reveal Ciri's whereabouts but brought her activities to the attention of the Wild Hunt, who began to hunt after her trail. Sensing the Wild Hunt's pursuit of her and having exhausted magical means, Yennefer ultimately chose to enlist the help of Geralt, Ciri's adoptive father and the best tracker she knew.
The witcher in White Orchard.
In May 1272, Yennefer sent Geralt a letter, arranging to meet in the village of Willoughby. However the village had been burned down, due to the Third Northern War reaching the region, so she headed through to the Nilfgaardian Garrison, passing through White Orchard in quite a rush. From the garrison, she headed to Vizima, meeting with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, concerning the location of Ciri. After a while, she heard Geralt was in White Orchard looking for her, so the sorceress rode with a Nilfgaardian escort to the White Orchard inn where she found Geralt and Vesemir.
Yennefer announced to Geralt that the emperor himself had summoned the witcher to Vizima. After agreeing and saying their goodbyes to Vesemir, the pair left with the escorts toward Vizima. Once night struck, the company was attacked by the Wild Hunt. The riders killed all of the soldiers and just before they could catch Geralt and Yennefer, the sorceress destroyed a bridge with magic, blocking their pursuit. Just the two of them reached Vizima alive.
Description.
The lady of Vengerberg was famous for her beauty, even though she was nearly a century old. Yennefer had locks of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume, falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in shape with a slightly receded chin. Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable violet penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed wisdom and imperiousness. Yennefer's nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender neck hung a black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it.
Yen had pronounced cheekbones, natural, slightly irregular eyebrows trimmed by hand and emphasized with charcoal, long eyelashes, and petite hands. Even in high-heeled shoes she wasn't tall, was beautiful but threatening, having incredibly thin and slender waist and slender legs.
She always dressed in black and white, at times wore stockings, wore frilled panties but never wore "trivialities" with underwire, she didn't need to. Her voice was resonant and mildly derisive. Her overall feminine shape was one of a twenty-year-old girl and she moved with a natural, unforced grace. She was a quarter-elf (meaning she had a quarter elven blood, in her case on her mother's side).
It is implied that her attractive looks were a product of magic and had been acquired during her training, as with most other sorceresses. Geralt notes how her shoulders are slightly lopsided and by the end of the story realizes that Yennefer used to be a hunchback. Nevertheless, his love for her does not diminish.
"The World of the Witcher".
Yennefer assists Dandelion in writing "The Magic and Religions of the Continent", the third chapter of the compendium. Within the chapter, a fragment of records document her formative years as a student at Aretuza.
"Adepts name: Yennefer"
 "Former name: Jenny"
"After initial testing confirmed her magical talent, the adept was admitted to Aretuza's first class. The girl comes from a pathological family – her father abused her psychically and physically, and her mother failed to support her. This rejection and abuse were likely precipitated by the deformation of the girl's spinal column and scapula (she was a hunchback), or possibly by her mixed human-elven bloodline (she is quarter elvish, her mother a half blood)."
"It was undoubtedly the lingering effects of these traumatic childhood experiences that drove her to attempt suicide soon after admission to our academy. The girl tried to cut open her forearm veins and ended up inflicting serious tendon damage (healer documentation attached for reference)."
"Despite the above, the adept was personally recommended and very highly graded by the Chancellor of our Academy, Archmistress Tissaia de Vries. Her deformities and tendon trauma were corrected with use of higher magic during her first year, and her further eduction has fully vindicated the Chancellor's high opinion."
"Adept Yennefer is highly talented and determined student. Her results on subsequent exams have remained excellent."
"The Witcher".
Yennefer does not appear in the first game. During its events (year 1271), Yen is 98 years old. However, she is indirectly mentioned on several occasions.
Yennefer appears in flashbacks in the second game.
In an optional encounter at the very beginning of the game Geralt (still without his memory) meets the Crinfrid Reavers where they mention that they were intending to rape the sorceress and not him (during the events of "Sword of Destiny"). Despite this they fail to remember her name believing her to be called "Connifer".
In the end of the game it is revealed, that Yennefer is probably alive, but has amnesia like Geralt, and that she is located somewhere in Nilfgaard.
Also, if the player decides to prevent Síle de Tansarville from being torn to bits, she will tell Geralt where to search for Yennefer.
"The Witcher Battle Arena".
Yennefer was a playable hero in the now defunct MOBA, having been added with the Season 2 Update on 29 June 2015. Her alternative skin was called Ravenlord's Embrace and one of weapons was called Dark Moon weapon.
In the third game, Yennefer is one of the main characters, and is voiced by . Her face was originally intended to be based on a 3D scan of Polish model Klaudia Wróbel, however after initial in-game tests, the developers decided to reshape the face in order to give Yennefer a colder and meaner look. Her first appearance is in the opening cinematic, wherein she is escaping from a battle between Nilfgaardian and Northern forces. Having recovered most of her memory, she has agreed to the serve Emperor Emhyr's interests in the hunt for Ciri. There is also a free DLC which gives Yennefer an alternative outfit.
Yennefer had a note delivered to the witcher Geralt of Rivia stating that she needed to meet him urgently. Yennefer had given them a location to meet her, however the village was destroyed forcing her to flee towards White Orchard where Geralt alongside another witcher Vesemir lost her trail. Unknown to the witchers, Yennefer had then gone to Vizima, however as they had asked the nearby Nilfgaardian garrison commander for information about her location, the captain informed Yennefer of this. Knowning the witcher would be Geralt, Yennefer travelled to meet him immediately before taking him to Vizima to meet Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. En route, they are ambushed by the Wild Hunt, who slay their Nilfgaardian escort, before Yennefer destroys a bridge to prevent the Red Riders from pursuing them.
As it turned out Yennefer had learned from the emperor that Ciri had returned to this world and that the Wild Hunt was pursuing her. After Geralt's audience, Yennefer explained that she had been using all manner of spells and rituals to try and track Ciri, only to alert the Hunt to her efforts. Therefore, she decided to rely on more conventional methods by turning to the best tracker she knows. She agreed along with Geralt to search for Ciri. She decided that he would search Velen and Novigrad for her whilst deciding to investigate Skellige herself.
Geralt later rendezvoused with Yennefer in Skellige during King Bran Tuirseach's funeral, where she explained that she suspected Ciri to be behind a cataclysm on the eastern end of Ard Skellig but Ermion, another of Ciri's tutors, refused to let her access the site, until they spoke with Crach an Craite. Afterwards, Yennefer and Geralt attended a wake at Kaer Trolde, where they stole the Mask of Uroboros, which possessed the ability to see the past events of the place it is viewed it. Upon arriving at the devastated area, they were confronted by Ermion, who warned them that it could only be used once and that using it will bring a cataclysm upon Skellige. As Geralt argued with Ermion, Yennefer went deeper into the devastated area and activated the mask, which caused a storm. Geralt ran to Yennefer and, using the mask's power, they found a place in the area where the elven mage had disintegrated a member of the Wild Hunt, then opened a portal and fled with Ciri. Ermion arrived soon after, and the two told him what they have found out. Ermion revealed to them that the Wild Hunt was recently seen on Hindarsfjall, so Geralt and Yennefer went there to investigate.
Upon arriving to Hindarsfjall they went to the village of Lofoten, where the women were performing a ritual. Yennefer and Geralt interrupted them and asked about the Wild Hunt and Ciri. They were told that Ciri has been in the village, and that she was seen with a man they referred to as Craven. The two of them were in the stables right before the Wild Hunt arrived and attacked the village, killing many of its inhabitants. When asked about Craven, the women said that he went to the sacred garden near the village to defeat Morkvarg, some time after the incident, so Yennefer and Geralt went there to find him. In the garden, they found a body, and Yennefer decided to use necromancy to make it speak.
The man's real name was Skjall. From what the body said, they learned that Ciri left with the elven mage on a boat as they were being chased by the Wild Hunt. Later on, Uma arrived on the same beach. After hearing the whole story, Yennefer forced the body to go back to its dead form. Yennefer's usage of necromancy drained all the magical power from the sacred garden, which the villagers of Lofoten didn't take lightly, and they blamed Yennefer and Geralt for not respecting their customs and beliefs. Still, Yennefer didn't care much about villagers' opinions, and she and Geralt ignored their claims. After leaving the garden, Yennefer asked Geralt to meet with her in Larvik, another village on Hindarsfjall, if he wanted to help her with something.
Geralt met Yennefer at the inn of the village, where she told him she wanted to tame a djinn that belonged to a mage who sank his ship near Larvik harbor. They searched around the bay for the wreckage, until Geralt found a large crater on the bottom of the sea, and half of a seal inside it. He returned to Yennefer on the boat at the surface, and they concluded the mage asked the djinn to teleport him somewhere, which caused a part of the ocean's surface to teleport as well. Yennefer used the part of the seal to open a portal near the other half. Upon going through the portal, the two of them found themselves on top of a mountain, with the wreckage laying nearby.
At this point, Yennefer confessed to Geralt that she needs a djinn to remove Geralt's last wish, which was to bind the two of them forever, so that she could see whether they truly love each other or if they are together because of the magical bond. The player can decide how Geralt would feel about this. Going through the wreckage, they found the other half. Yennefer connected the pieces which summoned the djinn. After a battle, they tamed it, and Yennefer commanded the djinn to remove the magic between her and Geralt. After this, they decided to sit on the edge of the ship, and Yennefer confessed to Geralt that she still has feelings for him. At this point, the player can decide whether Geralt also keeps his feelings for Yennefer or if he is no longer in love with her. This choice doesn't affect gameplay as much, but it is crucial to the ending itself, and Geralt's fate.
After sitting some time on the edge of the ship, Yennefer opened a portal to her room at the Kaer Trolde inn, and they returned there. They knew Uma (also known as 'the ugliest man alive') was somehow important to finding Ciri, and assumed that it is probably a human, but under a curse. Yennefer decided to go to Vizima to report to the emperor, while Geralt went off to get Uma. Afterwards, they were to rendezvous at Kaer Morhen and decide what to do with the cursed being.
As Geralt was on his way to Kaer Morhen with Uma, he was intercepted by Nilfgaardian soldiers, and brought to Vizima to report to Emhyr himself. Yennefer was also there, and the two of them explained to the emperor what they found out and what their plans were. Afterwards, Yennefer teleported to Kaer Morhen, while Geralt went there on his horse with Uma. Upon arrival, she started ordering everyone around, ordering Eskel to collect forktail spinal fluid and for Lambert to imbue the phylactery with Power from the Circle of Elements.
Subsequently, she attempts to contact Ida Emean via megascope but some interference cause her three separate megascope crystals to explode. When Geralt arrives, she has him search for the source of the interference, which turns out to be dimeritium bombs created by Lambert, which Yennefer suspected he planted out of spite. With that out of the way, Yennefer successfully contacted Ida, who translated the Elder speech riddle to be as old as the Aen Undod.
In order to lift the curse, Yennefer reveals that she intends to put Uma through the first half of the Trial of the Grasses and to use a prolonged magical treatment on Uma to reconstruct his original body piece by piece. Using the phylactery Ciri had repaired, they were able to contain the curse. Uma is revealed to be a transformed Avallac'h, the elven Sage who helped Ciri, who revealed where their young ward was hidden.
Yennefer was finally reunited with Ciri after so many years, but the happy reunion was short-lived, as the Wild Hunt descended on Kaer Morhen. Yennefer participated in the battle by putting up a magic barrier to force the Hunt's navigators to open portals outside the fortress.
In the aftermath of the battle, Yennefer decided that they needed to reunite the Lodge of Sorceresses and managed to work out a deal with Emhyr, with the promise of amnesty and asylum for the Lodge if they help defeat the Hunt. She and Triss traveled to Novigrad to search for Margarita Laux-Antille and Philippa Eilhart respectively.
Yennefer later met with Geralt at Crippled Kate's to wait for the one man who escaped Deireadh prison, who then panicked, assuming the both of them to be bandits and ran off. They managed to catch up with him and clear up the misunderstanding. Returning to Kate's, the escapee explained that his knowledge of herbs enabled him to use mushrooms growing inside his cell and belladonna to fake his death, tricking the witch hunters into throwing him into the corpse pit, which led to the sewers.
Yennefer then devised a plan for Geralt to infiltrate Deireadh through Oxenfurt's underground elven ruins and provided him with a device to signal her to teleport in once he had found Margarita. However, she could only teleport Margarita out, forcing Geralt to find another way out on his own.
Developer comments.
The sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg - a one-time member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, Geralt's love, and teacher and adoptive mother to Ciri - is without a doubt one of the two key female characters appearing in the Witcher books and games.
The books provided our artists with a greate deal of detailed information about Yennefer's appearance, including everything from her hairstyle, figure, and height to the color of her eyes and hair to such nuances as the shape of her face and nose. All of these traits were considered while drawing the concepts and creating the model for this sorceress. ""
"The witcher first met the raven-haired sorceress a good twenty years back. Their friendship and feelings between them were born of a common adventure involving a genie and a wish granted to Geralt that intertwined their fates inextricably."
"In the time since then their relationship had, however, been quite stormy - rich in ups and downs, crises and break-ups. Geralt and Yennefer's love provides irrefutable proof that "opposites attract.""
"A few years ago Geralt and Yennefer had, after a long separation full of adventures for them both, gotten back together again. Their moment of repose was interrupted by the Wild Hunt, which took Yennefer captive. The witcher set out at once to save her, but lost his memory while doing so. When he finally recovered it, he immediately set off once more on his quest to find his beloved sorceress."
"The circumstances of Geralt's initial reunion with Yennefer after two years were quite different than he had imagined. The sorceress was not only safe and sound, but had even secured the aid of an unexpected and mighty ally - the Nilfgaardian Empire."
If Geralt romances Yennefer in Skellige
"A thick air of repressed hostility reigned during Geralt's time with Yennefer in Skellige. More than once the sorceress sharply expressed her displeasure, sparing no cutting remark - just like during the best years of their relationship. In the end, however, the witcher's patience was rewarded, and their expedition to retrieve the mask of Uroboros brought the former lovers back together."
"The gulf that had arisen between them during their time of seperation seemed that much narrower."
"In order to obtain the information they needed Yennefer did not hesitate to resort to necromancy, and destroyed the goddess Freya's garden while doing so. If the proud sorceress felt any guilt as a result,as usual she showed no sign of it."
If Geralt helps Yennefer in The Last Wish 
"The idea of hunting another genie together did not at first arouse Geralt's enthusiasm, but Yennefer had a truly valid reason for wanting it. If she succeeded in forcing the genie to take back the wish binding her to the witcher, she would finally know if the feelings between them were truly love or merely magic."
If Geralt tells Yennefer he loves her in The Last Wish
"The genie granted Yennefer's request and broke the thread of destiny binding her to Geralt. Luckily it turned out their love could continue—without the need for supernatural assistance."
"Though the sorceresses' difficult character had made life miserable for everyone at Kaer Morhen, in the end it was her stubborn determination that led to Uma's disenchantment and lifting of Avallac'h's curse."
"Yennefer had always felt some ends justified otherwise unsavoury means. When it became clear rescuing Ciri would require the help of Philippa Eilhart and the other sorceresses of the reviled Lodge, she forgot about any bad blood and convinced Emhyr to grant them amnesty."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Strangers in the Night is one of three quests in Chapter I which Geralt must complete in order to gain the trust of the Reverend and proceed with his investigation of Salamandra.
Walkthrough.
The Reverend has refused to help Geralt in his investigation of Salamandra unless the latter can prove that he can gain the trust of three prominent local citizens: Mikul, Odo and Haren Brogg. Not being one to give up easily on anything, the witcher sets out to do just that.
He goes to see Haren Brogg at his house in the small fishing village just outside the main cluster of houses in the Outskirts, opposite the old mill. It seems that the merchant has some problems at night with drowners ransacking his stock of wares which he stores on the riverbank just to the east. Geralt agrees to have a look, for 200 . Brogg seems grateful to have anyone have a look and agrees to the price.
That night, while checking things out, the witcher does indeed encounter a band of pesky drowners prowling around the various crates and boxes making up Haren's goods. He quickly dispatches them only to be surprised by a band of Scoia'tael. Their leader initially mistakes Geralt for a hawker. Upon realizing his mistake, he explains that he was expecting to meet Brogg there and buy some weapons and other supplies for his comrades; the cover of night being their only chance to come for the goods given the current social climate.
Spare the Squirrels: Geralt concedes that it can not be easy to get supplies and allows them to take what they need and be on their way. The elves pay Geralt 200 .
Kill the Squirrels: Geralt takes exception to their insistence on taking the goods, after all, Haren never mentioned any Scoia'tael. He prevents them from taking the cargo and a fight ensues. The Squirrels are determined and fight to the last, but the witcher prevails.
He then goes back to Haren to report on his findings.
Phases.
Drowners.
Haren has a problem: drowners attack the people who watch his goods at the riverbank at night. I promised to help him. I need to go to the riverbank after dusk and kill any drowners I find lurking by the crates of goods. "I must kill the drowners that haunt the riverbank at night."
Drowners.
I slew several drowners. That should do for now. I'll make sure it's quiet and report to Haren for my reward. "I killed all the drowners. I should see Haren." (500 XP)
Trade: I dealt with the drowners and then I sold Haren's goods to the elves. I must talk to him. "I should see Haren." (200 + 3500 XP)
Fight: After I dealt with the drowners, I encountered a band of Scoia'tael. The elves wanted to take Haren's goods, but I refused to let them. I should inform Haren of my progress. "I must talk to Haren." (3300 XP)
Haren's Trust.
Apparently, the elves I met are Scoia'tael. Haren is trading with them - a rather risky business. He paid me for my services and it seems I gained his trust. That should help with the Salamandra issue. "I succeeded in earning Haren's trust." (200 )

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
The Secret Garden is a quest in Chapter I which begins when the Reverend asks Geralt to gain the trust of the three most prominent villagers, one of whom is Odo. The Reverend gives the witcher a ring to prove that he comes with the cleric's blessing, otherwise these respected citizens will have nothing to do with him.
Walkthrough.
In order to advance his investigation into Salamandra, Geralt must earn the trust of the most prominent citizens of the Outskirts. One of these individuals is Odo, a drunkard, a cheat and a dice player with too much money. Speaking with Odo is easy, if you know the right people and like to punctuate your sentences with a drink.
It seems he has a pesky gardening problem, carnivorous weeds to be exact, and he would like them to be dealt with. After a hard round of bargaining, and a few more belts of the good stuff, a deal is struck. The agreement is scarcely in place, when our witcher suddenly finds himself outside in the dark, drunk and facing the aforementioned plants.
Of course he dispatches them without delay and meanders back to Odo's house, only to be accused of having been the one to insist on fighting the plants drunk in the first place. As if! Once more Odo tries to weasel out of paying the full amount of the negotiated reward, but the witcher stands his ground. Grudgingly, Odo accords both his trust and the sum.
Phases.
Plants.
Odo asked me to eradicate the predatory plants that have sprouted in his garden. He claims they only surface at night. "I must destroy the carnivorous plants in Odo's garden."
Job Done.
I killed those strange plants. I wonder where they came from... I should see Odo about my reward. "I should see Odo and collect my reward."
Odo's Trust.
Odo is a miser and a cheat. Luckily, he's also a coward. Ultimately, he paid me for destroying the predatory plants, though it took a little convincing. "I succeeded in earning Odo's Trust." (100 + 4000 XP)

Buried Memories is a quest which is given to Geralt by Mikul, a guard at the Merchants' Gate in the Outskirts in Chapter I. It is one of three sub-quests spawned by Of Monsters and Men, the other two being Strangers in the Night for Haren Brogg and The Secret Garden for Odo.
Walkthrough.
In the course of his investigation into Salamandra, Geralt must gain the trust of the entire village in the Outskirts. Most notably, he must earn the trust of the three most prominent citizens, Mikul, Haren Brogg and Odo. A little convincing is required before Mikul will talk, but once he does, Geralt learns that he needs to have a crypt cleared of its most recent inhabitants, dead'uns.
Clearing the crypt would allow Mikul's fellow City guardsmen to go on a much talked about treasure hunt. The task is not too difficult. There are about six ghouls to be dispatched. A lone ghoul attacks initially, followed by two more and then, in the larger chamber with the Circle of Elements, three more attack. Kill them all, collect any useful skinnable items.
Sadly, along the way Geralt discovers the body of a young woman, Ilsa, who has apparently taken her own life with a vial of poison. He reports back to his employer who is most distraught to hear of Ilsa's fate. It seems Mikul loved Ilsa. He immediately blames the local witch, Abigail. But the crypt has been cleared so payment is requested and collected.
Phases.
The Ghouls.
I promised Mikul I'd kill the ghouls that have made the crypt their lair. "I must kill the ghouls in the crypt at Mikul's request."
Job Done.
I managed to kill the ghouls. Inside the crypt, I also found a young woman's body and a small vial... I should see Mikul, tell him what I did. "I should see Mikul and collect my reward." (1000 XP)
The Second Post.
After the Salamanders attacked, Mikul decided to move to the post at the Miller's Gate. I should see him and report what happened in the crypt. "I must see Mikul. He's at the Miller's Gate."
Mikul's Trust.
It seems the girl from the crypt was Mikul's beloved, Ilsa. The guard accused the witch of poisoning Ilsa. Mikul also told me that the Salamanders all have passes and leave and enter Vizima as they please. "I earned Mikul's trust." (200 + 3000 XP)

Racists is a quest in Chapter I introducing a dwarf named Zoltan Chivay, an old friend of Geralt's.
Walkthrough.
As Geralt makes his way through the Outskirts, he comes upon a dwarf who is surrounded by thugs intent on shaving off his beard in the fishing village. They are taunting him with the likes of "Hands off human women, dwarf!" and "Send him to a reservation!". Geralt's sense of justice is tested and he must decide whether or not to help the beleaguered dwarf.
After dispatching the racists, Geralt is surprised to learn that the dwarf, Zoltan Chivay, knows him already.
Phases.
The Fight.
I couldn't stand by and watch those racists torment the dwarf. "I decided to intervene between the racists and the dwarf."
Help.
I helped Zoltan fight the racists. I should talk to the dwarf. "I helped Zoltan fight the racists." (2000 XP)

Hot Potato is an optional quest in Chapter I in which Haren Brogg gives the witcher a sealed parcel to bring to a man named Coleman in Vizima.
Walkthrough.
After clearing the riverside of drowners, allowing Haren Brogg's merchandise to once again move unfettered, Geralt asks him if he has any more work for a witcher. As it happens, he does and asks our hero to deliver a parcel of dubious nature to a man named Coleman in the Temple Quarter.
Coleman can initially be found in the back room at The Hairy Bear, usually in the company of Ramsmeat. When Geralt first speaks to him about the parcel and the fact that it is missing, the witcher has three conversation possibilities:
Notes.
If you choose to allow the Scoia'tael to take Haren Brogg's goods during the Strangers in the Night quest, Coleman will be killed in Chapter II as soon as you enter the detective's house. You can still complete this quest if you deal with him "before" going to see the detective - after all, there is no rush.
Phases.
The Parcel.
I accepted a job from Haren Brogg. I need to deliver a small parcel to Vizima, to a man named Coleman - no questions asked. I can find him at The Hairy Bear. Easy money or lots of trouble - we'll see... "I have to deliver a parcel to the Hairy Bear in Vizima".
Missing Parcel.
Haren's parcel is missing from my things. Did Jethro have anything do to with this? I need to have a word with him... "Haren's parcel is gone. I should put some pressure on Jethro, maybe he'll cough it up."
The Missing Parcel.
The jailer Jethro deemed the parcel illegal and took it. I doubt I can get it back. The addressee will not be pleased. "I need to tell Coleman about the parcel."
Resolution (Compensation, Fiasco, or A Threat).
Compensation.
I admitted I lost the parcel and agreed to pay compensation. "I have to find 100 orens for Coleman."
Payment.
I compensated Coleman for the lost parcel. He seemed both surprised and a little disappointed - as if he was expecting me to challenge him... "I compensated Coleman 100 orens for the lost parcel." (–100 , 1500 XP)
Fiasco.
I told Coleman someone stole the parcel from me. He wasn't surprised to learn that the guards had something to do with it... "Coleman forgave me for losing his parcel." (2500 XP)
A Threat.
Without going into detail, I told Coleman I don't have his parcel. He threatened to kill me. "I crossed the local bandits. I'll have to be on my guard."
The Parcel.
The bartender at the Hairy Bear claims he doesn't know where Coleman is. I guess I should look around the city for him. "I need to find Coleman. He must be in town."
The Witcher's Threat.
I dealt with the goons that Coleman sent after me. Then I gave him a piece of my mind... about any further attempts of that kind. Coleman didn't know I was a witcher. He seemed a bit intimidated by my skills. "I should tell Coleman that he's messing with the wrong person." (2000 XP)
Coleman Trembling.
Coleman looked scared after he saw how I dealt with his boys. He tried to appease me... In any case, he seems to have forgotten about the parcel. "Coleman shouldn't be a problem anymore."

Dead Hand of the Past is an optional quest in Chapter I given by Declan Leuvaarden.
Walkthrough.
Geralt meets a merchant at the Country Inn called Declan Leuvaarden. Declan's friend has disappeared in a cave beneath the walls of Vizima while trying to avoid the quarantine and bring goods into the city. This person has encountered monsters before, so if he has been killed, it follows that the monsters are not to be taken lightly.
Declan explains that he would like the witcher to find his missing friend for 200 , but failing finding him alive, the orens should cover a "decent burial". When pushed on what a decent burial would entail, Declan intimates that the crypt beneath the Reverend's church would do in a pinch. This is indeed a good thing as it turns out that Declan's friend has fallen prey to echinopsae.
The burial itself is not as easy as one might expect either, as Geralt is confronted by the King of the Wild Hunt in the crypt beneath the Reverend's chapel, just as he is trying to place Leuvaarden's friend's remains in the crumbling sarcophagus. They discuss destiny, catch up on old times and, based on your choices during the conversation, the King either leaves with an ominous promise or he calls forth the specter of the recently deceased Leo. It appears that Leo holds Geralt responsible for his death and a skirmish ensues.
After the fight, Leo's remains reveal a piece of Red meteorite ore, useful in forging a better sword. Geralt could really use a better sword right about now...
Phases.
The Cave.
The merchant Leuvaarden's companion disappeared in the cave beneath the city walls - a cave supposedly infested with monsters. The merchant asked me to bring his friend back or bury him if he's dead. He promised to pay me 200 orens, no matter the outcome. "I have to find Leuvaarden's companion in the cavern beneath the city walls."
Remains.
I found human remains in one of the echinopsae. That must've been Leuvaarden's companion... Now I need to bury him. I should talk to Leuvaarden again. "I need to bury Leuvaarden's companion. I should talk to the merchant again." (500 XP)
The Burial.
Leuvaarden suggested I bury the body in the Reverend's chapel. I guess I should ask the Reverend for permission. "I should ask the Reverend for permission to bury the body in the chapel."
 The Reverend refuses to let me inside the church. I have to earn his trust somehow. "Somehow, I need to convince the Reverend to let me bury the body in the chapel."
The Reverend gave me his permission to bury the body. I should enter the church, find a place for the burial. "I should bury the merchant in the chapel's cellar."
As the Reverend is dead, I shouldn't have any problems burying the body in the church. "I can bury the body in the chapel."
Payment.
I buried Leuvaarden's companion. It's time the merchant paid me. "I need to see Leuvaarden and collect my payment." (500 XP)
Leuvaarden.
After what happened in the village, I doubt I'll find Leuvaarden here. He has probably hidden behind the city walls. "I should look for Leuvaarden in Vizima."
Maybe I can find Leuvaarden in Vizima. If I do, I'll collect payment then. "Maybe I can find Leuvaarden in Vizima."
Companion Buried.
I buried Leuvaarden's companion and got paid well for it. The merchant fulfills his end of the contracts he makes... though strange contracts they are. I mean, I'm a witcher not a gravedigger... "I buried Leuvaarden's companion and got paid well." (200 , 1000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;She's No Early Bird is an optional quest in Chapter I: Geralt finds Vesna, a local barmaid, in trouble on her way home from work.
Walkthrough.
Vesna remains at the inn until after Geralt speaks to her. Then she will leave every evening at 20:00, and can be found in danger as early as about 20:15. If Geralt leaves the inn and heads north at this time, he will see a group of men threatening to rape her. If he approaches, he must decide whether or not to help her.
If Geralt kills her attackers, he can offer to walk Vesna home. (If he lets her go home alone, she will be killed.) She lives with her grandmother southwest of the Reverend's chapel; if you can get there before 21:00 you will only have to fight two scripted groups of barghests (each near a shrine). After 21:00 you risk additional barghests, ghouls, and (if you take the long way) drowners. Vesna "is" vulnerable to attacks, so make sure you direct monsters away from her (she can still knife-fight in a pinch, though - let her pick off stunned enemies).
After a successful escort, Geralt can suggest another meeting, giving you a chance of receiving her Romance Card.
Successfully defend Vesna: Some bandits tried to rape the waitress from the inn. I decided to help her. "I decided to help the waitress." (500 XP)
Fail to save Vesna: "I failed. Vesna Hood is dead." (1000 XP)
Walk Vesna home: I decided to help Miss Hood get to her grandma's place in the Outskirts. I need to protect her from the creatures she could encounter on her way. "I should protect Vesna on the way to her grandmother's house."
Tell her to get lost: I decided not to help the waitress in distress. I'm sure she can take care of herself. "I decided not to help the waitress."
Phases.
Barghests Attack.
I managed to defend Vesna from the barghests. We have to move on, get to her grandmother's house. "I should protect Vesna on the way to her grandmother's house."
Successful walk Vesna home: Another group of barghests. I wonder where they all come from. Apparently, we don't have far to go. "I must protect Vesna as we near her grandmother's house."
Fail to get Vesna home:
"I failed. Vesna Hood is dead." (1000 XP)
Get a date: I walked Vesna home and we agreed to meet by the Old Mill after sunset. Vesna asked me to bring some wine. "I should show up at the Old Mill after sunset with a bottle of wine." (1000 XP)
Skip the date: I said goodbye to Vesna. She's a nice girl... "I got Vesna home safely." (1000 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;Safe Haven is a quest in Chapter II which Geralt hears about from Zoltan Chivay. He only gets the details from Leuvaarden, the person actually in need of his services. It seems drowners are wreaking havoc on Leuvaarden's business interests at the landing in the swamp. He will pay to have it sorted, pronto.
Walkthrough.
The very first step is to speak with Zoltan Chivay or Siegfried about work for a witcher in Vizima. Either will tell you that Leuvaarden needs help with some problems down at the dike. Once you are able to access the dike, find Leuvaarden and speak with him to get further details, then use the services of the ferryman to go to the swamp. Once there, you will find a fireplace near the large tree by the landing. Meditate there until midnight, or wander around the swamp doing other stuff until midnight-ish. Then, roam the small area between the landing, the fireplace and the woods. One-by-one drowners will appear. Keep killing them until you get a status update on the quest.
Phases.
The Merchant.
The merchant Leuvaarden apparently has some work for a witcher. I can find the merchant on the dike, where he conducts business in daytime. If I mention our mutual friends, I will easily get the assignment. "I should go to the Dike, where I can expect the merchant Leuvaarden to have a job for me."
Drowners in the Swamps.
Leuvaarden offered me 400 orens for killing drowners. I should use the boat to get to the swamps and get rid of the monsters that have been haunting the harbor at night. "I must use a boat to get to the swamps and get rid of the monsters who come to the harbor at night."
The Reward.
I killed all the monsters - time to collect my reward from Leuvaarden. I will find him on the Dike. "It's time to go to Leuvaarden to collect my reward. I will find him on the dike." (500 XP)
Quest Completed.
I collected my payment - working for Leuvaarden is a sheer pleasure. "I collected my payment." (400 + 2000 XP)

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Wanted is a quest which follows the witcher as he pursues the Professor, trying to avenge Leo's untimely death at the hands of the cruel assassin.
Walkthrough.
The quest begins when Geralt finds an arrest warrant for the Professor on the Notice board outside the Outskirts Inn and ends with the Professor's death in the bowels of the Salamandra base. There is no guesswork in this quest; all advancements are a result of other (often previously-unrelated) quests.
Notes.
In the phase about the reward offered for Salamander brooches, despite having already met Declan Leuvaarden in Chapter I, you will not be able to speak with Leuvaarden about this until you get the information from the 'Messenger' at the Hairy Bear Inn, which confirms that Leuvaarden is indeed the person paying for the badges. To get this information from the messenger, drink with him (he is a lightweight; you will only need five beers). Don't threaten him or try to bribe him, neither will get you anywhere. To only sell badges to the messenger, drink one beer with him, then stop the drinking mode and speak with him again, now the dialogue option "i want to sell badges" is available.
Phases.
The Professor.
If you find the arrest warrant:
 I found an arrest warrant for the Professor - the man responsible for the assault on Kaer Morhen and for Leo's death. If the Professor is a wanted man, Salamandra must have enemies. Any enemy of my enemy is my friend... I should talk to the city guards in Vizima, see if they can't help me contact the Professor's foes. "Maybe I can find the Professor's enemies by speaking to some of the city guards in Vizima."
If you don't find the arrest warrant:
I saw them release a criminal, the Professor, from the city jail... That bastard is responsible for the assault on Kaer Morhen and for Leo's death. If the Professor was arrested, Salamandra must have enemies. Any enemy of my enemy is my friend... I should talk to the jailer Jethro. Maybe he can help me contact the Professor's foes. "Maybe I can find the Professor's enemies by speaking to some of the city guards in Vizima."
A Reward for Brooches.
It seems a mysterious, wealthy man is offering a reward for Salamandra brooches. Clearly, the gang got on his bad side. Jethro told me I can find this individual's messenger every evening at the inn. I should talk to him. "I should speak to the messenger if the man who rewards people for killing Salamanders. I'll meet him tonight at the Hairy Bear."
The Professor's Death.
The Professor is dead. Two options: dead or alive. I chose the former. This hardly ends my battle against Salamandra, though... "Two options: dead or alive. I chose the former. The Professor is gone." (1500 XP)

 &lt;data source="id"&gt;&lt;label&gt;ID&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Flowers and Gold is an optional quest in Chapter II which Geralt can obtain by speaking either with the ferryman or Yaren Bolt, a woodcutter.
Walkthrough.
When Geralt first arrives at the landing in the swamp, if he speaks with the ferryman again (since he had to speak to him to get to the swamp), he will find out that Yaren Bolt has some work for a witcher, or so it seems: flower-picking not usually being up there on the list of witcherly activities. But I guess this is herb-gathering, much more manly. To get all the details, Geralt must speak with Yaren in the Lumberjacks' glade directly.
Note: There is a (very minor) bug in the game at this point. When Geralt has his conversation with Yaren, the only way to actually get the quest is to agree to "play herbalist" and let Yaren describe the Beggartick plants, whether or not Geralt already knows about beggartick (and might even have some in his inventory at that very moment!). However, this is very minor and does not otherwise affect gameplay. One might not even call this a bug, but more of a poorly executed game advancement device, as Beggartick becomes more plentiful in the swamp after this conversation. It gets more plentiful still after this quest is complete, of course!
So, Yaren gives Geralt the quest to get Beggartick for the ferryman and off he goes to gather flowers, killing all those nasty creatures who get in his way. Once Geralt has the five blossoms, he must bring them to the ferryman, not to Yaren. The ferryman then thanks Geralt, takes the flowers and gives him the cash to bring back to Yaren. Only then should Geralt go back to see Yaren to report on his progress and collect the reward.
When he goes to negotiate the reward with Yaren, Geralt has a choice:
Keep the gold: Since he did all the work, he can "keep the money", which will displease Yaren but not make a complete enemy of him (you can still get the A Long Way from Home quest).
Share the gold: Geralt can "share the money" as originally agreed.
So ends the quest.
Phases.
Beggartick Flowers.
I made a deal with the chief lumberjack Yaren Bolt. The dwarf asked me to find beggartick flowers and he arranged a buyer - the ferryman at the harbour. Yaren Bolt expects half of the payment for selling the herb. I have to find 5 beggartick flowers and bring them to the ferryman who lives in a house at the harbour. "I have to find 5 beggartick flowers."
Note: There are 200 XP to be had for simply speaking to anyone about beggartick.
Monopoly.
I learned that lumberjacks respect Yaren Bolt's monopoly on herb trade. "Lumberjacks respect Yaren Bolt's monopoly on herb trade." (100 XP)
The Druids.
The druids told me about the beggartick flower. It is a valuable and rare herb. "Beggartick is a valuable and rare herb." (100 XP)
Nonhumans.

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress in the 13th century. Called the Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A former member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.
She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but also unhappily in love with the latter. Triss took care of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and was like an older sister to her. It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.
She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never used them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions, and used amulets to treat herself. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.
Biography.
Early life.
She was born and grew up in Maribor. Sometime during her childhood, she had a conduit moment and was noticed by sorcerers. Thus, she found her way to Aretuza. Here, she became a sorceress on her own, specializing in making of magical potions, mainly healing ones. This was rather amusing twist of fate as she herself was allergic to magical potions and could only tolerate non magical ones.
During her studies, she befriended the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, and by 1249, the two of them were already close friends and colleagues. After graduation, she became a very well known and respected sorceress, taking her assignment as a advisor to the throne of Temeria.
Romance with a witcher.
Some time later, Triss found out about her friend's relations with Geralt of Rivia. Curious about the nature of that relationship, she used a little bit of magic and seduced the witcher, resulting in short relationship between them.
After some time however, Geralt simply ended the relationship from guilt. This proved to be very difficult for Triss as she fell in deep love with Geralt. Despite that, the two of them remained very good friends in years to come and even though Triss was still unhappily in love with him, he did not wish to start anew.
The Battle of Sodden Hill.
In 1263, after the First Northern War with Nilfgaard started, and the kingdom of Cintra destroyed, sorcerers and sorceresses under the leadership of Vilgefortz of Roggeveen decided to stand on Sodden Hill supporting Northern troops with their magic. Here, they wanted to stop the invading forces. Triss was among those who volunteered. The battle was brutal and the mages stood against incredibly strong forces but in the end, they managed to defeat the invaders. The cost of victory was high, though, as 13 mages died. As a matter of fact, it was first believed that the number of dead was 14 - the last one being Triss. She was very seriously wounded, sustaining burns on her body, but also having all of her hair burnt off. With Yennefer, the only mage that would have still recognized her, blinded during the battle, she was counted amongst the dead.
When Geralt rode near Sodden some time later, he saw the memory stone erected in remembrance of those who gave their lives to protect the North. Triss was among them, which saddened Geralt very deeply. When it was later discovered that Triss had indeed managed to survive the battle, she became known as "the fourteenth of the hill".
Kaer Morhen.
In December 1265, Triss received a message from Geralt, asking her to come to Kaer Morhen to help him with his Child of Surprise - Ciri. Ciri was trained by the witchers, yet she started to show some strong magical abilities that were beyond what was conventional for witchers. Thus, Triss accepted and went there, but she was reluctant to be near Geralt again as her feelings for him had not faded. During her stay, she constantly struggled with the way she felt, but eventually managed to clear her mind and do her job. Ciri, as she discovered, was a young lady with a sad history and the two of them took a liking to each other instantly. Their bond was so strong that Ciri started to consider Triss her older sister and vice versa. Some disquiet between Triss and the witchers surfaced when Triss discovered that the witchers wanted to submit Ciri to special potions. While not as invasive as the Trial of the Grasses, the potions would still cause harm to her body and most likely leave her barren. She begged them not to give her those, and eventually they agreed.
The other problem was that Ciri slowly became a woman and, being only girl in the keep, she had nobody to ask about specifics that comes with that. When Triss discovered that Ciri had no idea about her own cycles and that the witchers were unaware of them as well, she was furious. Since then, whenever Ciri came in dress, the training would stop until she change to the training attire.
Caring for Ciri.
More problematic, however, was her increasingly strong proficiency with magic. The witchers told Triss, that since Ciri came to the keep, she had 3 incidents where she spoke with a different voice in an unrecognizable language and entered a trance-like state. In the last one, she also foretold the death of Geralt and Coën. They said that the first time it happened was after Ciri accidently drank a potion, the same potion, that now stood before Triss. When Ciri came, Triss tricked her into drinking said potion to the shock of all the witchers. She told them however, that she knew what she was doing, and she wished to understand the trances. Ciri started to dance and not long after fell into a trance. Triss telepathically connected with her and tried to find out the problem. While connected to the young girl, she felt a strong presence inside her, hallucinating that she was back at the Battle of Sodden Hill. Triss used all her power and identification spells but it all proved futile. This battle of wills proved very draining and she passed out.
Later, she woke in her bed with Geralt next to her. He told Triss that she was out for six hours and ensured her that Ciri was alright and slept in her room. The sorceress told Geralt that whatever was wrong with Ciri was way too powerful for her and that he should contact Yennefer, who was more knowledgeable about such things. Geralt was reluctant, considering their past, but Triss insisted it would be the best for the girl. After Geralt agreed, Triss told him that when spring came, they should take Ciri to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander. The witcher agreed and then spent the night with the old friend, taking care of her.
Over the next few months, Triss spent every day with Ciri and taught her various topics, including the Elder Speech and how to apply make-up. In February 1266, as the spring neared, the witchers were slowly preparing to go on the path once again and wanted to know all the relevant news from the Continent, so as to decide where to go.
Triss told them everything she knew and they eventually talked about the possibility of a second war with Nilfgaard. This resulted in a heated debate about witchers and their neutrality on politics. Ciri ran in and interrupted the conversation, saying she wanted to kill all of the Nilfgaardians for they did to her city and grandmother Calanthe. Angered by this, Geralt told the young girl he was training her to defend herself only, not to seek revenge. Ciri ran outside and stood on the edge of the walls, tripping and nearly falling to her death, just in time for Geralt to catch her. With that, Triss and Geralt decided that with the morning light, they would go to the temple in Ellander.
Path to the temple.
Triss, along with Geralt and Ciri, went south across the Gwenllech and Buina rivers. Not long after, Triss became ill, having very strong stomach aches and cramps. Her illness was worse and worse to such a state, that she was not able to hold herself in the saddle. Thus Geralt had to carry her on his horse. But even with that, they were slow and had to stop for the sorceress to relieve herself.
Eventually they arrived at a fort at the foot of a bridge. This however proved unhelpful, as the settlement had been attacked by elven commandos of Scoia'tael the night previous. Triss was laid down with the other wounded while Geralt went to find out what their options were. He learned about the attack and the planned retaliation, however he knew they had none who could cure Triss. What was worse, the men started to think that Triss may have some infection that could spread, even though Geralt told them that mages cannot have an infection due to their immunity, and that it had to be a case of food poisoning, they did not want her there.
Thus the trio was forced to go on. Fortunately, Geralt learned about a convoy that went the same way as they need to so they rode to them. There they discovered that in the convoy was an old friend, the dwarf Yarpen Zigrin, leading his company of dwarves. Geralt persuaded Yarpen and Vilfrid Wenck, who was in charge of the convoy, to allow the trio to join them. Triss was laid to one of the wagons but her state was still very severe. She was no longer able to relieve herself on her own and Geralt had to carry her into the woods.
They continued on the way towards the Lixela, and Triss started to feel better, but she was still very weak thus Geralt and Ciri had to help her with bathing and clothing. As a matter of fact, despite her state, Triss rather enjoyed Geralt holding her so tightly and caring for her. Sometime later the convoy was approached by soldiers from Kaedwen. Those soldiers warned the men that Scoia'tael were near so they should continue very carefully. Not long after that, the elves indeed attacked the convoy. Triss was thrown out of the wagon and suffered a nasty wound to her head. The attack was swift but the defenders managed to repel it. By that time, Triss was well enough to be able to take care of the wounded and help them with her magic.
The rest of the journey was without any incident and they successfully arrived in the temple. Triss then went on her own giving her farewells to both Ciri and Geralt.
Thanedd coup.
On June 30th 1267, she travelled to Thanedd Island to attend the Grand Mage's Assembly between the Chapter and Council of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. At the evening banquet, she spoke with the brothers Drithelm and Detmold and then Geralt before Yennefer interrupted them. During the night, she joined the Northern supporters in arresting the Nilfgaardian-allied traitors, and was quite annoyed and surprised when she found Lydia van Bredevoort's corpse, due to the agreement of no-bloodshed. When Geralt passed the group, she helped him stand due to him being lightheaded, and then ran off to find Drithelm, Carduin and Dorregaray, to bring them to Garstang on Philippa Eilhart's orders.
After they all arrived in Garstang, a fight broke out between Philippa and Tissaia de Vries, who grew angry and freed the traitors from their dimeritium cuffs, sparking a intense conflict between both sides in the main hall. After a band of Scoia'tael broke in and started firing their bows, the massacre became worse when the roof started to crumble and Triss was injured. She fled from the fight and eventually found a heavily wounded Geralt, and tried carrying him away from the conflict until they ran into Tissaia, who teleported the two away from the invading Redanian soldiers. They were transported to Brokilon, where Geralt was received by the dryads. Triss left soon after recovering, back to Thanedd, where she found a frightened Dandelion and explained what had happened, what the political implications were, and of his location healing in Brokilon.
By the end of July, due to the coup and Nilfgaard's newfound alliance with Temeria, Foltest drove all mages who had served him out of the kingdom, including Triss. She travelled with Philippa Eilhart, Margarita Laux-Antille, Keira Metz, and another unnamed mage to Tretogor, and later Montecalvo, where they tried to assist Queen Hedwig regain control of Redania.
Formation of the Lodge.
On August 5th, the four used a projection spell to begin the first true meeting of the Lodge of Sorceresses, focused around recruitment and their purpose, summoning Assire var Anahid, Sabrina Glevissig, Sheala de Tancarville, and Francesca Findabair. Despite initial disagreements over the events of Thanedd, they agreed to work together to protect the safe practice of magic. Backed by Margarita's evidence of women performing better with magic (based off comparing pupils from Aretuza and Ban Ard), they agreed women would only be allowed to join.
"The Witcher".
Triss is a major character in "The Witcher" computer game. She is one of the first people Geralt meets after being found unconscious in the woods by his fellow witchers.
She is also the one to nurse Geralt back to health after his first battle with Azar Javed in the Swamp. Once Geralt regains consciousness, he finds himself in the bedroom of her luxurious Trade Quarter home, and he sees her talking presumably to another sorceress. She diligently "checks him for internal injuries".
"Along with me and the other witchers, Triss fought in defense of Kaer Morhen. The sorceress stood against the mysterious mage, one of the leaders of the assault. She was injured and lost consciousness. Ironically, Triss is allergic to magic and she can only be administered natural healing potions."
"Triss Merigold is my friend. She saw me die and my return to the world of the living surprised her. Triss is a sorceress — one of the most influential and talented of her kind. She has numerous powerful friends, and she knows the Kaer Morhen witchers. She is one of the few people who know the way to the fortress. I have a feeling Triss likes me a lot."
"After Leo's funeral, the sorceress teleported to Vizima. She decided to use her extensive contacts and search for information on Salamandra. Triss promised to find me as soon as I arrive in Vizima."
"Triss found me in the swamp, where I lay unconscious after my clash with Azar Javed. She transported me to her house in the Trade Quarter and took care of me until I came round. Lying there awake I overheard Triss gossip with her friend on the magic communicator, and I now know that other sorceresses are also interested in Salamandra."
if Geralt leaves Alvin with Shani:
"I left Alvin in Shani's care. Triss decided that I don't trust her and that I prefer the medic. She is angry with me and it seems our affair is over."
if Geralt leaves Alvin with Triss:
"I concluded that it would be best to leave Alvin in Triss' care. She saw my choice as proof of my trust. She decided I liked her more than Shani, which only improved our relationship."
"Dandelion delivered a letter from Triss. The sorceress has asked me to take good care of Alvin. She is also worried about me — she hopes we can have a steady relationship and raise Alvin together when I complete my mission."
"I answered Triss' letter and explained my feelings."
"After Foltest's return to Vizima, Triss fell into disfavor — the monarch didn't approve of her political scheming. The sorceress is practically a hostage at the Royal Palace and her fate is in my hands."
"Triss joined me during the attack on the Old Manor. As a friend, she aids me in my search. I think she seeks revenge on Azar Javed for their magical duel at Kaer Morhen."
"I met Triss, or rather a vision of her, in the Ice Plains. The sorceress helped me pursue the Grand Master."
Romance.

Prologue
During the prologue, after dealing with the Salamandra invasion of Kaer Morhen, Triss is gravely wounded and needs a special potion which Geralt must brew to help her recover. If not rushed during the dialogue, after drinking the potion, she offers Geralt his first sexual encounter of the game.
Chapter III
If it was Triss and not Shani who was chosen to take care of Alvin the second romance option becomes available if she is given a ruby ring, and in regards to Alvin, Geralt must be strict at least once.
"".
Triss plays a major role throughout the story. She first appears in the prologue as Geralt's lover; her feelings for him have evidently remained unchanged. Triss assists Geralt and Foltest in taking La Valette castle. She gets separated from them when a dragon attacks Foltest's forces. After Geralt is imprisoned for Foltest's murder, she meets up with him and Vernon Roche before they set sail for Flotsam, having lost her position as advisor after Foltest's death. In Flotsam, she meets with fellow Lodge member, Síle de Tansarville, and becomes suspicious of her presence. She helps Geralt prepare to fight a kayran by introducing him to Cedric, finding the Kayran's lair, and helping him create a potion to allow Geralt to resist the beast's poison. After Geralt meets Letho, Triss and Cedric break into Síle's room and Triss uses the megascope to try to gain more information on Síle (by speaking either to Dethmold or Philippa). Shortly after, Letho abducts Triss and forces her to teleport them to Vergen.
In Vergen, Triss gets away from Letho and tries to make contact with Philippa. She finds Philippa's room, but comes upon Philippa's apprentice, Cynthia, there instead. Cynthia, a Nilfgaardian spy, captures Triss using Artefact compression, and smuggles Triss across the mist of wraiths, where Triss eventually makes it into the hands of Nilfgaard's ambassador, Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. Before Geralt can rescue her, Shilard takes his ship to Loc Muinne.
In Loc Muinne, he commissioned the help of Assire var Anahid to decompress Triss. Triss is restrained and interrogated for more information of the Lodge. If Geralt chooses not to save her, in favor of helping Roche or Iorveth, a massacre erupts in Loc Muinne, with opposing forces fighting not only one another, but also mages after Nilfgaard revealed the Lodge's involvement with the Northern regicides. In the chaos, Letho saves Triss from the Nilfgaardian camp, and takes her to the now abandoned Temerian camp and protects her until Geralt arrives after fighting the dragon. Once Geralt reaches the camp, Triss steps away, while the two witchers talk.
If Geralt chooses to rescue Triss, he breaks into the Nilfgaardian camp and eventually finds her restrained and asks her about the Lodge and their influence behind the Demavend and Foltest's murders. When Geralt and Triss go to the amphitheater, Triss reveals Síle's role in the assassinations, allowing Carduin to reject Síle from joining the reformed Conclave of Mages. Triss and Geralt are separated again when Geralt goes to fight the dragon, and they meet up shortly afterwards, where Triss tells Geralt that Letho is waiting for him. On their way to Letho, Triss explains that mages helped prevent further bloodshed in the city. Regardless whether Geralt rescued her or not, after Geralt confronts Letho, he leaves Loc Muinne with Triss (and maybe with Roche or Iorveth).
Romance.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher 2 romance."
Triss is the default romance option - the game begins with her and Geralt already in a relationship. One of three opening scenes of Geralt's story during the prologue shows him getting up as Triss lies naked beside him as a messenger soldier enters their tent to summon the witcher to the King Foltest's side.
The first real opportunity arises near the end of Chapter I during the quest The Rose of Remembrance. When given the option to go to the elven baths, Geralt can choose to take the sorceress along with him. After a battle partway through the quest, the ground under their feet collapses, sending the two plummeting into ancient elven baths. Noting that an immediate escape is impossible, the two can take advantage of their location. Selecting the correct conversation options will initiate a cutscene, in which Triss completely takes off her clothes with magic and jumps into the water. Our Witcher soon joins her in the bath. After the lovers enjoyed one another well enough, Triss comments this short time of bliss in such a manner: "We should take walks more often. For a while there, I forgot all about Flotsam, the Scoia'tael, the kingslayer, the whole world really...".
"I have known the sorceress Triss Merigold for a long time, for she is one of the Geralt's closest friends. The young, pretty, talented, auburn-haired mage from Maribor hardly reminded me of the giggling flapper of years past. Her knowledge, abilities and loyalty had brought her far. A hero from Sodden, known as the Fourteenth of the Hill - for she was mistakenly counted as the fourteenth mage to die in that battle - she sat on the royal council of King Foltest of Temeria. And though they say that a monarch's favor is uncertain - for the king had once expelled all mages from Temeria - Triss had managed to gain Foltest's trust. As regards the witcher, everyone who was witness to Triss' friendship with Geralt, anyone who saw them together, would easily confirm that these two had much in common... And it is common knowledge that an old flame never dies..."
"For those reasons, after Foltest's death the sorceress decided that she would help the witcher most by staying by his side. Not heeding her threatened position at court, she harnessed all her strength and powers to helping Geralt, whom she still had feelings to."
"I was not there at the time, but I heard tales of the show of power Triss put on at that beach near Flotsam. Though she was weakened and barely conscious, the sorceress managed to sustain a magical barrier and the three survived the Scoia'tael arrows thanks to her."
"Nobody was surprised that Triss knew Sile de Tansarville. A more attentive observer would certainly have noticed the chill in their greetings, as well as Triss' evident dislike of her elder colleague."
If Geralt agrees to forget about chasing the king slayer:
"The sorceress' greatest desire was to be the one and only woman in Geralt's life, and to forget about all the troubles and dangers they had recently experienced. Geralt agreed to her proposal, but before they could act, Fate showed them how hard it can be to carry out such romantic plans."
If Geralt decides he must continue chasing the king's slayer:
"The sorceress' greatest desire was to be the one and only woman in Geralt's life, and to forget about all the troubles and dangers they had recently experienced. Geralt was close to agreeing to her proposal, yet he knew that it would be impossible to lead a quiet life until he could clear his name. His decision saddened Triss, but the sorceress understood."
"Triss was kidnapped by Letho. Geralt and I feared what he might do to her. Believe me, it was eating me alive, making rest impossible."
"Searching Sile's quarters and talking to her neighbor brought more questions than answers. It appeared that Triss had known the woman she had talked to, but the fragments of the conversation recounted to us remained mysterious."
"Triss had reached Aedirn – there was evidence to prove it. Finding her would prove difficult, however."
If Geralt chooses Iorveth's path and helps Philippa in order to lift a curse from Saskia instead of rescuing Triss:
"In Aedirn, the search for Triss ended with the discovery of a bitter truth - transformed into a nephrite figurine, she had ironically been in the possession of an oblivious Geralt for a time and he had brought her straight to the Nilfgaardian camp. The Nilfgaardian emissary envisioned a special part for her in Loc Muinne..."
If Geralt chooses Roche's path and rescues Anais La Valette instead of Triss:
"In the end the sorceress was freed by a witcher, yet it was not Geralt. Thanks to Letho she escaped unharmed, but I am sure she would be glad to forget the time she spent in Nilfgaardian captivity. Thus were the lovers reunited among the ruins of Loc Muinne after their long parting, and the story of Triss Merigold's kidnapping ended."
If Geralt rescues Triss instead of Anais La Valette or Philippa:
"Yet the witcher foiled this plan, wrestling Triss from Nilfgaardian hands. I described the story's finale in one of my ballads, omitting the carnage Geralt wrought there, however. For his part, he thinks that my version, with its colorful description of a mounted pursuit of Renuald aep Matsen, a limp sorceress trundled across his saddle, is too pretentious. Witchers...no sense of licentia poetica at all."
"Triss had one more part to play, and a significant one at that. Thanks to her, De Tansarville's machinations were publicly revealed. The scene – now known as "Triss Merigold accuses the Lone Witch of Kovir" – passed into history and presently is one of the more common motifs in contemporary painting."
"The testimony Shilard extracted from Triss was used to accuse the sorcerers. In this way Miss Merigold contributed involuntarily to a witch-hunt greater than any before it."
"The Witcher Battle Arena".
Since March 31, 2015, Triss Merigold is a new playable character in the MOBA "The Witcher Battle Arena".
Triss returns in "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" as the leader of the mage underground due to the witch hunt begun by Radovid V. Her appearance did not change much but interactions with Yennefer prove quite interesting. There is also a free DLC which gives Triss an alternative outfit.
After the events at Loc Muinne Triss and Geralt (who had now regained his memory) separated. Triss decided to go to Novigrad, which many mages believed to be a safe haven, and set up a shop in the city center. The Eternal Fire religion in the city, however, declared all mages to be witches and traitors and began arresting and murdering them.
Triss was forced to seek the protection of The King of Beggars to whom she paid 80% of her earnings whilst attempting to gain enough money to escape the city with her fellow mages. Geralt, upon arriving at the city, found Triss with the King of Beggars and assisted her ridding a rat infested mill. The Mill owner, however, sold her out to the witch hunters, and if not for the efforts of Geralt, Triss would have been captured.
Triss accompanies Sigismund Dijkstra to Margrave Henckel's house to meet with Geralt, who was searching for Dijkstra's lost treasure; Triss agreed to stick her neck out in exchange for Dijkstra's financial aid in smuggling the mages out of Novigrad. After Geralt told Dijkstra that Caleb Menge, the leader of the witch hunters, had his treasure, and after the ex-spy had left, the witcher informed Triss that Menge had Dandelion imprisoned. To find Ciri, Triss then helped Geralt discover the location of Dandelion by allowing herself to be taken to the witch hunters and tortured whilst Geralt gained the information. Ultimately she kills her torturers before killing Menge.
If Geralt assists Triss in spiriting all the mages under her wing to Kovir, it results in the witch hunters targeting nonhumans. Helping Triss ensures she goes to Kaer Morhen to fight the Wild Hunt. Before the Hunt's attack, she is happily reunited with Ciri, whom she provides with a magical stone that will call down a fireball that would strike down all her attackers except herself.
Following the battle, Triss goes with Yennefer and Avallac'h to Novigrad to try and reunite the Lodge of Sorceresses, taking up residence at the Rosemary and Thyme, an establishment owned by Dandelion. Unfortunately, they had not much luck, as Ida Emean outright refused and Francesca Findabair wouldn't budge from her realm with a war raging.
When Geralt later arrived, Triss berates him for putting Ciri in danger by taking her to the Sabbath to face Imlerith. Afterwards, she informed him that the only Lodge member she could locate was Philippa Eilhart, who was tricked into her owl form by Arthur de Vleester, who put a dimeritium band on her leg afterwards. Worse yet, Philippa came into the possession of Zoltan Chivay, who lost her in a card game. Luckily, Triss found a feather. Using hydromancy at the fountain behind the Passiflora and divined that Philippa was in the possession of Sigismund Dijkstra. They rush to his bathhouse, where Philippa, having regained human form after Dijkstra foolishly removed her dimeritium band, was wreaking havoc. After Geralt managed to subdue her, Triss led her colleague to safety.
Romance.
"For the main article, see ."
Geralt can reignite his romance with Triss in separate stages. While extracting Lady Ingrid Vegelbud's son from her estate past the witch hunters, Triss gets drunk, which leads to Geralt kissing her as the fireworks start. At the conclusion of Now or Never, if Geralt professes his love for Triss and kissed her previously, she seemingly departs on the ship for Kovir. But she returns, interrupting Sigismund Dijkstra's anecdote about his affair with Philippa Eilhart. She asks to speak privately with Geralt at the lighthouse, where they have sex.
While searching for Philippa using hydromancy, Triss' spell in the reflection of the pool behind the Passiflora, changes to an unknown house. When pressed by Geralt, she reveals that King Tankred had offered her a position as his court advisor. She also reveals that the house is to be hers in Pont Vanis, where she wants them to live together after the Wild Hunt is defeated.
If Geralt finds one of Triss' lost earrings in their bed back at Kaer Morhen, he can return it to her. During the epilogue, Geralt and Triss settle in far-away Kovir. Geralt would take jobs, more out of habit than need, due to the fortune Triss received as the advisor to Kovir's king. If Geralt romances both Triss and Yennefer, they trick him into thinking they're having a threesome, only to leave him tied to the bed in the Rosemary and Thyme.
If Geralt romanced Triss in the main game, then she makes an appearance during Geralt's adventures in Toussaint.
After the quest Blood Run, Geralt receives a letter from Triss that begins the quest Turn and Face the Strange. The letter is read in her voice and not only details the discovery she made about Professor Moreau's research, but also expresses a desire that Geralt remain safe and return to her quickly.
During the quest The Warble of a Smitten Knight, Geralt can make the necessary vow for the knights' tourney on "his lady's love". In which case, he will say "I vow on the love of my lady, Triss Merigold, to respect the chivalric virtues".
After the main questline for Blood and Wine is complete, Geralt can return to his home in Corvo Bianco and is surprised by Triss, who is waiting for him. After an embrace, the two venture outside to a sunny spot overlooking the vineyard. Once there, they have a conversation about various topics, including current events in Kovir and romantic plans the two have for each other in the future.
"I always considered it a point of particular pride to count Triss Merigold of Maribor among my closest and dearest friends. This exceptionally talented sorceress was a shining star of her profession, the former mage advisor to King Foltest, and a famous hero of the Battle of Sodden, known as the Fourteenth of the Hill. yet in no way did she resemble her often unbearably haughty sisters in magic. Her deft mind, warm smile and considerable personal charm had always won over even the hardest of hearts."
"Though my personal relations with Triss never ventured beyond the fraternal, Geralt of Rivia at one point found her allure irresistible. From then on the two shared feelings that ran far deeper than a superficial and fleeting fancy."
"Yennefer told Geralt that Triss had recently taken up residence in the Free City of Novigrad."
"It seemed Triss had gone into hiding from the so-called witch hunters persecuting magic wielders in the city, turning to one of the leaders of the local underworld for protection."
"After a bit of a run-around Geralt found the sorceress, who had indeed entered into an arrangement with the so-called King of Beggars. She paid for his protection by providing magic services to his organization. Though Triss did not know anything about Ciri and her stay in Novigrad, she promised to do all within her power to aid Geralt's search."
"Though theoretically Triss and Geralt had ended their romance half a year earlier, it was clear the feelings they felt for each other had not vanished so easily. To deal with this, the sorceress pretended that nothing had happened and the witcher, as is his wont, sheepishly masked his feelings with a mix of hesitant interest and fake indifference. It must be said that both of them handled the situation quite awkwardly."
"The plan to get close to Caleb Menge that Triss presented to the witcher was very risky and placed her in great danger. The sorceress knew, however, that Ciri's life might be on the line, and so did not hesitate for even a moment."
If Geralt kisses Triss:
"The sorceress' laugh, the look in her cornflower blue eyes, the memory of enchanting moments spent together - all that surely weighed on Geralt's decision to kiss Triss in the Vegelbuds' garden. And though their moment of sweet oblivion lasted briefly, it breathed a gale's worth of new life into feelings between them."
If Now or Never is completed:
"Though Triss and Geralt said their final goodbyes on that wind-swept Novigrad dock, in the end the sorceress decided not to leave for Kovir after all. She knew that when Geralt asked her to stay, the witcher was opening up his heart to her for the first time."
"Geralt and Triss met again at Kaer Morhen. Triss arrived there at the witcher's behest to help defend Ciri, whom she had always treated as a younger sister."
"In the world of "The Witcher", only a select few talented and highly trained individuals can wield magic. As casting every spell requires knowledge, time, and diligent preparation, only the most adept in the mystic arts are proficient enough to use them on the battlefield. One such individual is Triss Merigold, considered to be among the most powerful members of the Lodge of Sorceresses, a secret organization of prominent female mages. Depending on whether the sorceress is your ally or your enemy, she can either annihilate you in a shower of flames or heal you in your hour of need. A dear friend to Geralt of Rivia and the personal advisor of King Foltest of Temeria, ruler of one of the richest kingdoms in the North, she has played a key role in the most important events of recent Northern history."
"Triss's power comes from knowledge, and whether it entails spying on others through her magical devices or using raw force to extract the information she needs, she always finds a way to get to the heart of the matter. Most of her spells take time to prepare but, given the proper momentum, she's an unstoppable force that can break through any obstacle in her path. Using her intellect and magical prowess, Triss is able to bend the rules in her and her party's favor, which will frequently come in handy during the numerous adventures to come."

Humans are the dominant race on the Continent, forming the majority of inhabitants in both the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire. When humans first arrived on the already-populated Continent, they quickly set about conquering the lands already inhabited by Elder Races. The humans thus established themselves as the dominant race and so elves, dwarves, gnomes, werebbubbs, and halflings are now generally referred to as nonhumans.
History.
Ancient times.
Hailing from a homeworld destroyed by themselves, humans first appeared in this world after the Conjunction of the Spheres. Nomadic tribes such as the Dauk and Wozgor people settled on the Continent at some time before the Nordling culture. Around five hundred years ago, after the First Landing, humans started to colonize and expand, pushing the elves back towards the east, taking over and creating many small temporary kingdoms, which eventually led to the creation of the Northern Kingdoms. Scholars speculate that the Empire's native inhabitants hail from a human culture predating those dominant in the North. Through further expansion, humans pushed the vrans into the Blue Mountains, and the werebbubbs into the remote regions of Mahakam and the Amell Mountains.
After conquering much of the Northern Kingdoms, a peace treaty was signed between the elves and men, though was quickly broken a few years later, when Redanian forces led by Milan Raupenneck attacked and massacred the elven city of Loc Muinne, plunging the Continent into the second elven-human war, which resulted in the elves being pushed even further east, and their numbers dwindling. However, another peace treaty was signed later in the war, which kept the elves under submission at the cost of complete surrender to the race of men, but years of this led to Aelirenn, an elven warrior, leading her people into a suicidal attack against the Nordlings, tired of elven suppression, which ended in a massacre and the death of her and her entire army.
The humans of the Northen Kingdoms were at war with elves in particular and had a rather poor relationship with the dwarves, halflings, werebbubbs, and gnomes. The races did live together in the cities, however, the non-humans were forced to pay a levy just for being non-humans. Several pogroms took place in the cities. Many of the larger human cities were built on the ruins of elven cities which the humans had burned down, like Vizima and Novigrad.
Characteristics.
Humans are not terribly dissimilar from Aen Seidhe elves in appearance and generally the same height. However, humans do not have pointed ears, delicate features and their teeth are slightly bigger. While elves tend to live far longer than humans, humans reproduce at a faster rate.

Continent

The unnamed Continent is where the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire lie. They are located somewhere on its western coast. Other places on the Continent include the Korath desert, Zerrikania and Haakland. Hannu, Zangwebar, Barsa, and Ofir may or may not be on the same continent as well, though these are described as being "beyond the seas".
Nordling cartographers for ages had claimed that the southernmost part of this landmass was Gemmera and that the lands below belonged to another continent. By the time of the Second Northern War, however, this belief was abandoned.

XP

Experience points (often abbreviated to XP) are a quantitative measure of character progression throughout "The Witcher" games. In all the games, XP is accumulated by completing quests, objectives, defeating enemies or monsters, or through special actions. These points are applied to a total score which is used to determine when the player will level up.
"The Witcher".
Completing quests and defeating monsters are the primary ways to earn XP, but sometimes simply speaking to the right NPC at the right time (usually to advance a quest) also earns XP.
By accumulating these points, Geralt's level periodically increases. Level 1 requires 1000 XP, and each subsequent level increase requires 1000 more XP than the last. Each time Geralt levels up he receives several talents that he can use to improve abilities, attributes and skills in the Hero panel (during meditation.)
Every ten levels, he also increases in rank, although the only effect of this is to change his 'title'.
 Novitiate Witcher: Levels 1 – 9
 Rising Witcher: Levels 10 – 19
 Skilled Witcher: Levels 20 – 29
 Seasoned Witcher: Levels 30 – 39
 Master Witcher: Levels 40 – 49
 Legendary Witcher: Levels 50+
Rank progression.
This table contains the cumulative experience required for each level along with the type and number of talents received upon reaching each one:
Notes.
In "The Witcher 2", Geralt can progress through a maximum of 35 experience levels, each of which requires 1000 XP. For each level, Geralt's Vitality increases and he receives one talent point to apply to a skill tree. Before talents can be allocated to Swordsmanship, Alchemy or Magic, 6 points must be spent in the Training tree.
In "The Witcher 3", Geralt earns ability points each time he levels up. These points are used to obtain upgrades to combat abilities, , or other skills. There are 70 levels worth of XP totaling 124,000 XP. From levels 1-10, 1000XP is required to reach the next level. From levels 11-20, 1,500 XP is required to reach the next level. For levels above 21 to the maximum of 70 (100 with "Blood and Wine" expansion), 2,000 XP is required to reach the next level. For the first 20 levels of New Game +, you gain twice as much experience points as in a regular game (from all sources). The table below shows the XP required for highlighted levels.
The amount of received for completing quests depends on the difficulty level and Geralt's level. If Geralt is six or more levels higher than the recommended quest level, he only gets 5% of the total reward for the quest (a few exceptions exist).
"Note:" Since Patch 4.0, the level difference after which quest decreases to 5% is changed from 6 to 10.
Regardless of the above, Geralt receives 1 for every 10 paid during the quest by selecting the yellow dialogue option (this rule does not work in some Hearts of Stone quests and Blood and Wine quests).
In addition, there's earned each time when Axii is used in dialogues, depending on Delusion's level:
Another source of is combat. You gain from 1 to 48 for killing an enemy. The amount depends on the difficulty level, Geralt's level, and the enemy's type and level. If Geralt is six or more levels above the enemy, the kill awards only 1 (2 on lower difficulty levels). Enemy upscaling does not affect the number of received in combat. In some quests, such as The Battle of Kaer Morhen, no are earned for defeating enemies. Geralt usually receives 1 for defeating an enemy in a fist fight.
Abandoned sites and Monster nests both reward unaffected by the level constraint and difficulty level.
"Hearts of Stone" expansion.
The number of experience points received for doing Hearts of Stone quests is presented below:

Alp

Alps or alpors are members of a vampiric race which inhabits the lands of the Northern Kingdoms since the Conjunction of the Spheres which occurred around 230s BR.
Physiology.
In many ways, alps are similar to two other species of intelligent vampires, mulas and bruxae, although seemingly less powerful than the latter. Silver used in form of weapons or chains, on the other hand, can hurt them and so they tend to avoid it. While resistant to sun along with mulas, bruxae, and Higher Vampires, they tan to almost black if affected by it too much. They have pointed ears, similar to elves.
They prefer to prey on sleeping people and creatures. They put targets to sleep by injecting a somniferous substance causing nightmares.

&lt;/infobox&gt;
"No other monster inspires so many myths and fallacies as the alp. People believe that this vampire is able to turn into a black dog or a venomous toad. They mistake alps for succubi, believing them to be lecherous and inclined to seduce handsome young men. Folk tales describe their charm and their beautiful, seductive voices, as well as their loathing of virgins. What is true beyond any doubt is that they move noiselessly and attack by surprise, rarely giving their victims as much as a chance to scream in terror."

An Alp bestairy entry can be obtained by reading the book Alps – Bruxae's Dangerous Cousins.
 "Looked like a bruxa, but that was no bruxa...– fragment of a conversation between the ealdorman of Falkoane and a witcher."
 "Alps are vampires that resemble bruxae in appearance. They are called phantoms by some, a name which fits well enough, for like phantoms they haunt and torment men. They usually take on the form of a woman, though they can also appear as animals. They are most often found prowling near villages. They attack at night and are most active when the moon is full. Alp saliva can make one fall asleep, and when applied to a sleeping man, can invoke horrible nightmares. Some suggest they are the cause of legends about men who go to sleep healthy and are found in the morning white as snow, not a drop of blood in their veins."
 "In combat alps display supernatural speed and incredible (even by vampire standards) stamina. One must aim one's sword with great precision, for alps are unequaled in the art of evading blows. The Yrden Sign is recommended, for it weakens an alp's defenses. Another strategy is to drink the Black Blood potion, for alps suck the blood of their victims to deprive them of strength and regenerate their own powers."
 "Unlike bruxae, alps cannot turn invisible, yet like bruxae, they emit a shrieking noise whose shock wave can incapacitate. Their greatest asset is their agility and they can leap with uncanny lightness that appears to border on the power of flight. When in human form, they easily blend in with the surrounding community, which makes them very dangerous indeed."
Combat tactics.
Similar to bruxae, knocking an Alp down with Aard sign may allow you to finish it in one strike if you're fast enough. Otherwise, coat your sword with Vampire Oil and maybe drink some Black Blood. Alps are extremely fast and prefer dodging to blocking, unlike bruxae. They also often jump out of sight to either drop down on you or prepare their shriek.
It is advisable not to waste too much time trying to chase down or go toe-to-toe with an Alp. Avoid the shriek, otherwise try to stay in place and block, preferably with a Yrden sign down.

Ghoul

After the Northern Wars, necrophages generally grew bolder and multiplied in the Northern Kingdoms; ghouls, a sub-species, became the most common corpse-eaters, usually found roaming around in packs, distinguishable from their cousins, alghouls, by the sickly paleness of their visage. After hunting unknowing locals, they shred their prey to pieces with fangs and claws, the corpse being then left to age. They can also hunt livestock, such as sheep and goats. While generally sensitive to silver, ghouls are also affected by light, such as the sun or fire.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;A horrible, low, and nasty beast, this abomination nests in cemeteries, old burial mounds (kurgans), necropolises, and on battlefields. Disgusting in form and character, it emerges to feed usually during the full moon, and well-rotted corpses are a delicacy for it. When driven by hunger, the ghoul will not hesitate to prey on the living. Only by fire, silver, and bright light can they be harmed. For this reason, it hunts only at night.
Journal Bestiary entry.
"Ghouls are said to have been humans who were once forced into cannibalism and, after many years spent in dark crypts, underwent a horrifying transformation. Only human flesh can satisfy their eternal evil hunger, so they kill people and store the remains in the recesses of their lairs."
Monsterbook.
Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the ghoul taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of "The Witcher":
"Ghouls, like drowners, appear often in the game. Geralt frequently has the opportunity to practice his silver sword techniques on this monster. Since the drowner became grotesque, we made the ghoul both scary and a bit pathetic, without rendering him humorous. As a foul scavenger, he has all the necessary attributes: deadly pale, spotted skin, a nose-less head resembling a skull, and a strong jaw capable of cracking open any bone. At bit of artistic trickery and clear connotations went into creating the model for this rather dumb, hideous creature."
"The ghoul is no joke – it is stocky, and ready to attack. It loves feasting on human cadavers, but has nothing against fresh warm meat. When it grabs its prey with its apelike arms, there is no escape."

 &lt;data source="alchemy"&gt;&lt;label&gt;Alchemy&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;

 &lt;data source="info"&gt;&lt;label&gt;Additional Info&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
The bestiary entry could technically be obtained by reading Ghouls and Alghouls. However, it is automatically available at the start of the main quest, Lilac and Gooseberries, where even otherwise Geralt would be forced to obtain it by killing ghouls as the very first enemies in the game.
 "Ghouls creep and crawl at nightEating everything in sightIn a snap they'd eat you, tooChop you up for a ghoulish stew!– Children's rhyme"
 "Ghouls and graveirs are hard to describe. In part, they resemble humans - yet on the whole, they are the utter negation of all that is human. Though they have arms and legs like men, they walk on all fours like dogs or badgers. Though they have eerily familiar faces, one searches them in vain for any sign of sentiment, reason or even a spark of consciousness. They are driven by one thing and one thing only: an insatiable craving for human flesh."
 "Ghouls and their more dangerous cousins, graveirs, usually feed in small groups, at times led by an alghoul. Since they delight most in the taste of fresh carcasses, they appear wherever newly-dug graves are to be found: cemeteries, crypts, catacombs and battlefields. Whenever the opportunity arises they hunt the living as well, especially when they have strength in numbers."
 "In a one-on-one fight with a trained witcher, a ghoul poses little threat, but one must remember that wounded individuals can erupt in a mad frenzy. At such times they attack fiercely, paying no heed to their own safety and brushing off all wounds. One must likewise bear in mind that ghouls and graveirs are particular dangerous around dusk and at night."
Combat tactics.
A key strategy to make fighting a group of ghouls easier is to keep moving around until one ghoul gets separated. When this happens circle the ghoul and try to kill it. Do small attacks now and then, but keep dancing around.
If a ghoul is low on health and starts snarling loudly, this is a sign that the ghoul is becoming enraged. Make this ghoul your priority to kill, as otherwise it will regenerate most of its health. When enraged the ghoul's behavior grows more aggressive; the Axii sign works well for stopping the effects of enrage.

Echinops

In the novels, echinopsae are depicted as animals (not man-eating plants, as in "The Witcher"). They are described as monsters covered in long and very sharp spines. They can shoot these up to a distance of ten feet. On impact, the spines shatter and the pieces work their way ever deeper into the body of the victim. Their spines are so long that when they are immobile, echinops resemble clumps of grass.

Echinopsae in the game are huge, carnivorous plants, similar to an Archespore.
 "Echinopsae are monstrous plants born of curses which grow in places where terrible crimes have been committed if the crime in question was never atoned for. The beasts try to take their vengeance on criminals, but they do not spare the lives of innocents who haplessly enter their territory."
Source.
Common echinops appears in " and is classified as a common class hybrid. It is vulnerable to silver and kinetic damage. The monster inhabits dense forests and is active at dusk. According to the bestiary, it is quite dangerous, despite its inconspicuous appearance. This description is only partially accurate, as the echinops is placed at the lowest difficulty level, along with the nekker or the common weremole. The monster is depicted as a large, hairless creature covered with short spikes. Its body and trunk resemble an echidna or an armadillo. Rather than using its spikes for combat, echinops instead attack with its sharp claws or by rolling towards the opponent.

Alghoul

Alghouls are a sub-species of necrophage, and the biological cousins of ghouls, distinguished by their darker visage, larger size and strength, colourings, and intelligence. After the Northern Wars, their numbers spread rapidly through the Northern Kingdoms, due to lack of control and widespread famine which attracted the corpse-eaters.

A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading Ghouls and Alghouls.
 "An alghoul's basically a badarse ghoul– Yarpen Zigrin, dwarven warrior"
 "Alghouls differ from normal ghouls in size, strength, coloring and, most importantly, intelligence. Whereas ghouls and graveirs are primitive creatures unfit to plan even the simplest ambush, alghouls and their kindred (such as cemetaurs) are capable of forethought, and are thus much more dangerous."
 "Ghouls seem to possess wits enough to at least know a brighter mind when they see it, and so let alghouls and cemetaurs lead their packs. A pack so led will terrorize all in its path, attacking not only lone travelers but also caravans and even farmsteads. When encountering such a pack the alghoul should be eliminated as a first priority, leaving the other beasts for once their leader is gone. One be particularly careful when fighting alghouls around dusk and at night, when they fight with doubled strength."
 "During combat alghouls and cemetaurs try risky maneuvers aimed at knocking their opponents to the ground so the others can finish the job by tearing them to shreds. Like a normal ghoul, an injured alghoul can fall into a frenzy and attack with blind fury. An experienced witcher knows to get out of its way on such occasions and strike from behind, while for an inexperienced witcher, such a turn of events often marks the end of his Path."
Combat tactics.
Alghouls are smarter and more powerful than ghouls, making them the greatest threat in a ghoul pack. An otherwise coordinated pack becomes less so once the alghoul has been dealt with. Axii forces the spines on an alghoul to retract after a few seconds, with the added benefit of temporarily stunning the creature.
An alghoul can emit a piercing scream to stun nearby victims, as well as send nearby ghouls into a raging frenzy. When enraged, an alghoul grows spines on its back. This makes attacking it a very dangerous proposition, as the spines are harmful if you use melee attacks.

Archespore

Archespore (scientific "archesporus") is a plant-like monster that appears in CD PROJEKT RED's "The Witcher" franchise. While it's restricted to the ground, this doesn't make it any less dangerous so caution is heavily advised when going up against one. However, just like any plant, it has a weakness to fire.

Fortunately, fire proved an equally efficient remedy for these cursed plants, and using the Igni sign does not require carrying an inconvenient tank on one's back.
 "Some crimes are so terrible that they fill people with terror and offend the gods. The criminal's ill will and the cruelty of his deed conceive a curse that brings the archespore to life. The beast attacks innocent creatures hatefully, trying to take vengeance until justice is done."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
The bestiary entry can be obtained by reading Journal of Research into Archespores.
"Looks like a flower to me. A hideous, disgusting flower.– Blasco Tennerbe, last words"
"Archespores look like gigantic, aesthetically unpleasing flowers with some of the traits of exceptionally cruel and bloodthirsty sundews. They are, however, far more dangerous than even the most colossal sundew. Their peculiar appearance makes them practically impossible to discern amidst other plants. By the time one draws close enough to realize what they are, it is often too late to flee."
"According to popular belief, archespores are cursed plants grown in soil fertilized by the blood of the dying. They are most often found in places which in the past saw pogroms, bloody rituals or cruel murders. Four types of archespore have been catalogued to date, differing from one another in terms of coloring: brown (the least dangerous), green and purple (the most dangerous). The final variant, said to have been cultivated by mages from Ban Ard, is the yellow archespore, whose strength is similar to that of its green-colored-cousins."
"Regardless of color, all archespores fight using similar methods: attacking with powerful, jaw-like leaves. If their victim is out of reach, they can also spray caustic acid which if it makes any contact whatsoever with the skin, can provoke a reaction similar to that caused by severe poisoning."
"Like other plants, all archespores are extremely vulnerable to fire, which is one of the most effective methods of fighting them. Silver also works well, as does any sort of shock wave. Archespores do not like strong vibrations, which cause them to flee underground at once. Due to the nature of their origins, oil damaging to cursed beings can also be useful against them."
Combat tactics.
Archespores have several deadly techniques. From a distance, they shoot venom that not only causes substantial damage, but also deals additional poison damage after striking. Their pods can explode, releasing an explosive poison that deals extremely high damage (but no lingering poison damage). The creature will also lunge forward if you get too close. They also have the ability to quickly sink into the ground and sprout from any nearby pods currently on the ground. They will do this if you manage to land several attacks in a row (3 Fast Attacks for example) and will leave a pod where they sank into the ground. If you don't immediately roll away, it will explode in your face like the other pods do. Fighting more than one can be very tricky, as the archespores you aren't currently attacking will use its ranged attacks to interrupt you as you try to kill its buddy.
Should it stick its head underground, it will summon explosive pods, but also become vulnerable. Run directly at it while the pods appear, and once you've closed the distance, hit it three times with strong attacks. An archespore will retreat into the ground after three hits, so you'll want to make them count. If time allows, position yourself behind it to increase the likelihood of landing critical hits to maximize your damage. Should it stay above ground and shoot poison globs at you, use the roll to dodge the globs. Rolling will allow you to move forward and close the distance, but a forward dash dodge will just be struck anyway. Once you roll into close range, the archespore will immediately strike with a lightning fast melee attack that will interrupt any of your attacks or Signs. So directly after your roll, dash dodge to the side. Then, counter with one fast attack (to stun it before it attacks again), one strong attack, and one use of slightly charged Rend for maximum damage. If you don't have Rend, just use a strong attack instead. When it retreats, back away from the soon-to-explode pod and repeat the process.
Multiple archespores are a bit trickier. While you're trying to deal with one, the other can pelt you with poison and interrupt your attacks, giving the spore you're currently after the chance to whack you with its melee and build up damage quickly, so you'll need to immobilize one. The Dancing Star bomb will do very little damage, but the burning will keep an archespore occupied long enough for you to approach and strike its buddy using the tactics detailed above. Bomb one, attack the other. Keep the fires burning until there's only one left, and then eliminate the survivor.
If you manage to destroy the pods, the archespore will be unable to escape while you mash attack, but so many pods tend to spawn that this usually isn't an option. As for your Signs, they're surprisingly ineffective in this fight. Igni will set a plant alight, but also causes them to relocate in order to smother the flames, which puts you back where you started with very little damage dealt. Curiously, Dancing Star fires will not cause it to relocate. Aard will knock a plant back and give you the chance to attack, but you won't be able to get it off before dodging its melee strike, and once you've dodged the melee strike, it's open to sword strikes anyway, rendering the Sign pointless. This isn't the case if you have long range on it though, as that will let you stagger a spore from outside its melee range, so if you have that perk, feel free to make use of it.
Use Golden Oriole if possible. It will protect you from the majority of the damage dealt by the poison spit, and if you have the superior version, you'll be able to slurp up the poison for free, massive heals, instantly turning the fight into an absolute joke.

Armored hound is a mutated and heavily armored hound of the Order is actually a small tank. It does not have a cannon, but it gladly lunges at opponents, knocks them down, and rips their throats open with a single snap of its jaws. Armored hounds are always hungry, so they usually devour their prey, which also makes them more fuel efficient than tanks.
They do not have fur or even skin, they have only red muscles, White fangs and Black claws, short tail and their eyes are yellow, are clad in armor in the stomach part of the armor, there is a blade.
"During the first stage of research, we performed experiments on animals only. Having bred a mutated hound, we are certain that the potion formulae are suitable and if we administer them to human subjects, we will achieve exactly what we seek."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the armored hound taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:
Salamandra – the ominous organization which the witcher must defeat – uses animals in its initial experiments with mutagens. These attempts result in mutated bloodhounds: primitive, vicious creatures that beast-masters lead on chains before unleashing them to wreak havoc.
The creature's silhouette was modelled after that of a fighting dog. Its head evolved gradually into a shape similar to that of a pit bull's head. As with other monsters, we strove to make the creature resemble extinct beasts, predecessors of today's predators. The mutation pursued by Salamandra were meant to emphasize the wildest and most primitive characteristics of the bloodhound's ancestors, to some extent reversing evolution.
The crude armor in which the creature is clad underlines its barbaric nature. An armored hound of the Order wears kilograms of steel without noticing their weight or experiencing any discomfort. The armor protects the beast's vital organs and underlines that it is no wild monster, but a creation of man."Progress", he said solemnly, "will illuminate the shadows, for that is its purpose, just as, without looking far, the purpose of an anus is to shit. It will ever be lighter, we will fear darkness and the Evil lurking there less and less. There may come a day when we will altogether cease believing that something lurks in the dark. We will scoff at those fears, call them childish, be embarrassed about them! But darkness will exist forever and always. And Evil will persist in that darkness with its fangs and claws, murder and blood. So witchers will always be needed.'" "The Lady of the Lake"

 "Folk of simple or superstitious minds claim committing particularly rotten acts will bring down the wrath of the gods in the form of "barghests," phantom dogs which stalk the roads at night. Even if this were their origin, barghests saints and sinners alike would need fear barghests, for they attack both with equal ferocity. Witchers rarely believe in the gods, but they do accept that barghests exist and are always connected with some sequence of tragic events that happened in the past. Their explanation, however, holds that barghests result from a curse or a concentration of ill will."
 "Barghests, like wolves, are stronger in packs. Together they surround their prey, leaping at it and tearing it apart with their teeth. If their prey defends itself too determinedly, they strike it with a blast of phantom fire. Since they are fast and agile, they can easily evade attacks directed at them."
 "They cannot be burned, but fire hurts them as if they were of flesh and blood. The Axii Sign also works on them."
Combat tactics.
Barghests usually appear in packs like dogs and wolves and behave simillary, with two major difference. They occasionally charge at the player in great speed, temporally blinding Geralt. Also, when being attacked, they sometimes counterattack by spitting fire towards Geralt, potentially set him ablaze. Barghests tend to use their special attacks more often when in pack, so try to single them out one by one might make the fight a little easier.
Quen can be used to protect Geralt from the flames. Barghests glow up a little before they charge, so keep an eye on them for a good timing to dodge. Yrden can slow the monster down, but can't help much more. Barghests are immune to burning and bleeding but are vulnerable to specter oil.

Basilisk

Basilisks are a species of draconid descending originally from Zerrikania and bred in the North during the 13th century.
Later becoming a pest and sometimes terrorizing communities, they have birdlike beaks, webbed wings, razor-sharp teeth, hooked talons, and crimson dewlaps. Their poisonous breath is deadly when touched, and has often led to many exaggerated folk stories, such as basilisks being natural prey to the marten and their breath turning those afflicted to stone. They are often found in arid, rocky environments, such as deserts or badlands, and are territorial creatures, willing to aggressively defend their domain against intruders.

In "The Witcher", basilisks do not appear until Chapter IV. The first encounter with them is usually on Black Tern Island, but possibly in the crypt in the fields, and they are an excellent source of XP.
 "Simple people call the basilisk the king of the Zerrikanian deserts and often mistake it for a cockatrice. They claim that the beast is filled with such hatred towards all living things that even its breath is venomous and its glance turns the unwary to stone. The fact that witchers often encounter basilisks in dungeons and cellars contradicts the legend and suggests these creatures can reproduce under any conditions like many of their nasty monster brethren. In fairy tales, the only certain way to kill a basilisk is by holding a mirror in front of its eyes to divert its deadly gaze. Witchers reply that it is far better to smash the mirror on the creature's head."

A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading A Few Remarks on Basilisks and Cockatrices.
 "In memory of the noble knight Roderick, slain during a valiant struggle against a basilisk. Let's hope the beast choked on his bones.– Gravestone inscription, Vizima cemetery."
 "Contrary to popular belief, basilisks cannot turn anything to stone with their gaze. That is small comfort, however, given that their acid, venom, claws and teeth provide them many other ways to kill."
 "Basilisks love dark, damp places such as cellars, caves and city sewers. They hunt by day, waiting patiently in hiding for their prey to come, then jump out in a flash to unleash a deadly attack."
 "When preparing to fight such a creature one should drink Golden Oriole, which will provide resistance to its venom, and also prepare Dancing Star or shrapnel bombs, which work particularly well against basilisks."
 "Basilisk leather is a highly-valued material used to make fashionable shoes and women's handbags. For this reason many men, their courage girded by goldlust, take to hunting them. Most of these hunts end in disaster, but some do manage to bag their prey, which has led to a drastic decline in this creature's numbers in recent years. Some mages and druids are of the opinion that basilisks should be included in programs meant to safeguard dying species. Everyone else thinks those mages and druids have gone completely mad."
Combat tactics.
Despite their appearance, basilisks are vulnerable to Igni and other means of using fire against them such as Dancing Star. A well timed bomb or burst of Igni can not only bring down a flying basilisk to ground level, but distract the beast from being able to properly defend itself. They are skilled at using their wings and the talons on their feet in a similar fashion to that of the cockatrice.
They can parry sword strikes with their wings and then leap up in to the air to land near devastating overhead blows with their claws. They can also leap up in to the air, hover momentarily, and then spit acid at their opponent from above.

Bloedzuiger

Travellers crossing swamps can be sure to encounter both leeches and bloedzuigers. The latter also feed on blood, but their gullets are particularly large and their stomachs are filled with acid, so they suck and digest both their victims' blood and intestines. Unlike leeches, bloedzuigers are rarely used in medicine.

 "The bloedzuiger, a grotesque monster from the swamps, causes terror among peasants because it pours digestive juices over the wounds of those who are still alive and then dines on their half-digested intestines."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the Bloedzuiger taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Reuplic."
Bloedzuiger lurk in muddy waters and surface only when attracted by the presence of warm-blooded creatures. They are slow and may seem grotesque, until a swarm of them surrounds its prey.
The Bloedzuiger was inspired by the leech, thus its segmented body and characteristic head, or rather, its bloodthirsty maw spiked with teeth. The bloedzuiger consumes both the blood and intestines of its victims. A strong and malicious beast, it can easily kill a human.
Bloedzuigers do not usually need to chase their victims, hence their thick, elephant-like legs. The spikes on their forelimbs prevent their victims from escaping. The insides of their barrel-shaped bodies are a dangerous weapon in themselves, as their digestive fluids are a mixture of strong acids. Woe to those who decide to gut the monster.
Bloeadzuiger is a necrophage class common monster. It has a stronger variation - the leecher. Both monsters are vurnerable to steel and fire. They dwell in wetlands and have the same strategy. They do not differ much in appearance - the leecher has additional spikes on its body.
According to the bestiary, the bloedzuiger and the leech have almost the same DNA, while the leecher's teeth are strong enough to pierce through the chain mail.

Bruxa is a very powerful type of vampire that takes on the appearance of a dark-haired, young human, most often female, but whose natural form is that of a large, black bat with sharp fangs and claws. It is one of few vampire species not affected by sun, the others being alps, mulas and Higher Vampires.
Bruxae are very agile and only silver swords are effective against them. While they have sharp claws for close up attacks, they can also let out a piercing scream from further away that can send even a grown man flying through the air. Only Quen is able to counter it, although the power of the cry can even break through it in certain situations.
The bruxae have the habit of singing in their native language, especially after they drank blood, and their songs are described as silent, shrill, and sickening. Thanks to these, bruxae can manipulate and bend to their will any human by altering their dreams and turning them into horrible nightmares.

"It is said that at night bruxae haunt attractive young men and drink their blood. These vampires move quietly in the dark to suddenly emerge near their victims. Bruxae are womanoids and may take the form of beautiful girls, leading some to mistake them for water-nymphs, but their long fangs and unrestrained thirst for blood always betray them."

"The bruxa is a higher vampire, that is a post-Conjunction creature, an intruder in our world. She appears as a beautiful woman, but when she is hungry or attacking, she is terrifying. As a vampire, the bruxa drinks blood. She often finds a victim to become her lover and a constant supply of sustenance at the same time."
"The bruxa finds the smell of garlic to be socially inconvenient at most. And she considers holy symbols to be interesting examples of handicraft. She endures the light of the sun well, but she prefers the darkness of the night. As you see, you can stuff most stereotypical preconceptions about vampires up your arse when it comes to a bruxa. So what works? The blade of the silver sword, as usual. Apart from silver, she can be wounded with fire and a stake, provided that the latter is as long as a wagon's drawbar. A Bruxa is a womanoid, just like an Alp."
"Less powerful bruxae often hunt in packs, making it easier to corner prey. If threatened, they attack with their talons and rip the victim apart, pausing only to savor the blood of their dying foe. The greatest threat to a witcher is the bruxa's voice. The creature can screech with such force that the shockwave will knock even a huge man down, making him easy prey for the vampiress. Blindness is as great a threat as this ghastly scream. Bruxae deprive their enemies of sight in order to play cat and mouse with them. Until sight returns, one should defend against their attacks in any way possible, for example by using the Quen Sign."
"The bruxae have masterful control over their blood circulation, rendering poisons and oils that increase bleeding ineffective against them. They are good at defending themselves against witchers' tricks, but they are vulnerable to fire and can be knocked down and finished off as they try to get up."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the bruxa taken from the Monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of" "The Witcher"​ for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:
In Sapkowski's stories this silent and seductively beautiful creature closely resembles a rusalka. In fact, she is a vampire, and one of the deadliest beings Geralt ever faces. The concept art, and later the model, had to capture all traits of this alluring yet frightful fiend.
The bruxa is built on contradictions. Her white pupils and blank face contrast sharply with her feminine silhouette. The long scarlet claws could be an elegant body adornment or simply marked with the fluids of a recent victim. Dried blood covers her breasts and mouth, leaving no doubt that the bruxa is a vampire, a monster in a beautiful woman's body.
The enlarged image of her torso reveals the texture details. The bruxa's skin is ghastly pale, wrinkled, and somewhat transparent, rendering visible the blood vessels underneath.
In the game, these female vampires inhabit dark crypts and ancient ruins. They approach gracefully and are easy to overlook. The abrupt attacks of bruxae stun Geralt; while he is helpless, they suck his blood to regain strength. The wound they inflict hemorrhage intensely. An eerie cry echoing through corridors indicates an approaching bruxa – at once both beauty and the beast.
She was clinging to the back of the dolphin in the dried-up fountain, embracing the moss-overgrown stone with her tiny hands, so pale they seemed transparent. Beneath her storm of tangled black hair shone huge, wide-open eyes the color of anthracite.
 ( ... ) The creature glued to the dolphin's back followed him with her eyes, turning her petite face with an expression of longing, and full of charm. He could still hear her song. pg. 62 and 82, "The Last Wish" (UK and (U.S. edition))
Bruxae were supposed to appear in the base game during its development in 2013 - 2014 but they were removed according to leaked materials.
In the final game there is a gwent card with a picture of a Bruxa as a part of the Monsters deck.
Also the female vampire from A Night to Remember is, according to the developers, none other than a bruxa.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
It was confirmed by some of the very first gameplay videos that the Bruxa is an enemy in the second expansion. The bestiary entry is automatically added during The Beast of Toussaint main quest.
 "If you must travel through the woods, steer clear of any places where you can hear several different kinds of birds at once. That sound means you're entering a bruxa's territory and can kiss your life farewell.– anonymous piece of advice"
 "Fortunately for us all, bruxae are rare creatures. Most live far from population centers, for they care greatly for their own safety and make their lairs in places where they cannot be taken by surprise. Those who decide to live near men avoid crowds and emerge from their shelters only at night. When they do, one could almost mistake them for delayed travelers hurrying towards their night's lodging, yet subtle details give them away: their close ties to birds, their piercing voices and the breathtaking speed of their movements. Bruxae are far swifter and stronger than men, but their greatest asset is their ability to turn invisible."
 "Bruxae dart about with uncanny speed, and with their power of invisibility they can easily confuse opponents and attack unexpectedly or from behind. Thus when fighting these vampires the Moon Dust bomb is a great aid – while it cannot eliminate the vampire's invisibility altogether, it can make it easier to track its motions. A generous smearing of vampire oil is also effective."
 "Bruxae use their sharp claws to attack and can easily break through an opponent's guard by buffeting him with a hail of blows from all directions. They will try to bite their prey and drink its blood once it is weakened, so every witcher who expects to encounter such a monster should swallow a Black Blood potion beforehand. Bruxae are also known for their sonic attacks, which knock down and stun their prey."
Combat tactics.
If the Aard sign is used on any bruxa you encounter in Toussaint, it is possible she can fall over and be killed by a single stab, similar to how harpies are defeated. Bruxae can turn invisible during the fight and perform strikes without being seen, making them dangerous foes.
The Moon Dust bomb is effective against bruxae, although not needed due to their slight visibility when moving while cloaked, it is noted, however, that you will not be able to lock on to the bruxa, thus making Geralt swing in directions without the usual precision. Yrden is extremely effective against bruxae as the vampire will uncloak when in range of the sign.
You easily can one-hit kill any bruxa by using a combination of Yrden and Aard Sweep. Cast Yrden immediately in an open area (a basic level Yrden can do the job). Pay attention closely to the cloaking distortion so you can clearly tell when they're about to close in on you. Once their cloaked selves are within the Yrden trap, immediately cast Aard Sweep, immediately knocking them back, but making sure they're still inside the Yrden trap. The trap will slow them from getting up significantly, giving you plenty of time to close in and one-hit kill them. This works on The Bruxa of Corvo Bianco as well, even on Death March.

Cockatrice

Cockatrice, also known as a skoffin and kurolishek, is an ornithosaur. It's also the only creature to belong to the order of ornithoreptile according to scholars, but why exactly they decided on this is not revealed. Its central tail feathers are also valuable as they're more durable and sharpen better than regular goose feathers for quills.['] Cockatrices are often found in remote, rocky areas such as canyons or cliffs. They are aggressive and territorial, attacking anything that ventures into their domain.
Superstitions surrounding the creature suggest that they are born of eggs laid by roosters consorting with other roosters. The egg must be incubated for forty-four days by a toad, which is devoured by the little beast as soon as it hatches. Another superstition states their glance turns the living to stone; neither are true.

Cockatrices are quite rare, with only three more appearing other than the Shrieker:
A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading A Few Remarks on Basilisks and Cockatrices.
 "Had meself eight heifers, five of 'em milchers. Then this cockatrice sprung up nearby, and now all's I got left's dried patties in an empty field.– Jethro, peasant from Pindal"
 "Foolish superstitions claim cockatrices, like basilisks, can kill with their gaze alone. That is utter nonsense, however, a cockatrice's gaze being no more dangerous than that of an angry goose. One should instead watch out for it's sharp beak and long tail, which it can whip to murderous effect."
 "Cockatrices thrive in dark caves, abandoned ruins, cobwebbed dungeons and old basements. Though small compared to griffins and manticores, they are more than capable of killing anyone who stumbles across them in a dark corridor."
 "Cockatrices do not shun direct fights, in which they strike furiously with wing and tail in an attempt to exhaust their foes. Blows from their beaks are especially dangerous, as they aim with deadly precision at exposed flesh and vital organs and leave bleeding, life-threatening wounds. When fighting them one should make liberal use of draconid oil as well as Grapeshot, whose shrapnel will pierce their delicate wings with ease."
Combat tactics.
Cockatrice will fight aggressively once the fight begins, so to take advantage of this aggression and force them to remain on the ground you should use aard and/or Grapeshot to your benefit.
While in flight, the creature is like other draconids in that will try a set of swooping attacks on you to grab/strike you with its talons. This can be avoided by rolling or dodging to the side, and after about three of these attacks it will land. Instead, you can bring the cockatrice down to the ground to hit it by either using aard, bombs, or the crossbow.Once it's on the ground, however, this is when it is the most dangerous. It will use its talons, wings and feet to strike against its foe, as well as its razor-sharp beak and tail tip. These attacks are fast, fairly long range, hit hard and will almost always accurately target vital regions on its victim causing the bleeding de-buff. If you back away from them even a small amount they will also frequently do a forward leap-strike; it has dangerously long range, does quite a bit of damage, stuns you and their semi-spread wings as they do it can also cause the hit so it is a very wide strike that can be difficult to roll out of range of. After taking a couple of attacks in a combo if you see it cover its head with its wings, stop attacking as this is effectively a parry that will do reduced damage to them, stagger you, break Quen if you have it active, and they will quickly follow up with a counterattack. Cockatrice are fairly resistant to Axii, though Igni can cause them to catch on fire.
The best strategy is to try and flank the cockatrice, ideally getting behind its wings to hit it in the back. It can't do a rapid turn and most if not all of its wide range attacks will miss, so it is possible to put out an unending series of fast attacks from behind the creature while constantly keeping pace with it to stay behind and remain unharmed.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Dagon is an underwater being worshiped by the vodyanoi and a small sect of humans as a god who awaits at the lake bottom for the right configuration of stars so that it may return to land to wreak havoc. Since it uncertain when this will come (or if it will come at all), it whiles the time away terrorizing all who live both under the water's surface and on land nearby.
"The Witcher".
Dagon is one of the boss monsters in the game. He appears in Chapter IV as part of the Ripples quest. He is worshipped by one faction of the vodyanoi who inhabit the Underwater City in Lake Vizima. The other vodyanoi worship the Lady of the Lake.
 "That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die."
 "Powers older than humanity slumber in the depths, where no sunrays disturb them. Gods and demons sleep in underwater cities awaiting their time, and it is said that when the hour comes, they will awaken and bring annihilation to the world. One of those creatures, Dagon, rests at the bottom of the lake and is worshipped by vodyanoi and lunatics. Dagon is an embodiment of strength and fury, and when he comes ashore, he becomes destruction incarnate. Forbidden books like the Hymns of Madness and Despair describe the ways to summon him, for he can only be called to a place dedicated to him."
Biography.
Deep in the eternal darkness of the abyss, powers older than men and elves lie aslumber, awaiting a time known only to them. When that hour strikes, they will awake and bring an end to the world. One such being bears the name Dagon.
Dagon's emergence is usually presaged by a thick fog, impermeable to wind or sun, that suddenly envelops a body of water. After that comes a gurgling and a powerful waft of slime and rotten seaweed. And after that... well, no one who's failed to flee at this point has lived to tell the tale.
When fighting in the fog, it is often difficult to estimate the enemy's strength. Anyone who has fought the monster hordes under Dagon's control knows this very well. Those beasts' numbers seem to double and triple when wrapped up in their dark lord's tendrils of fog. Within that murky mist, fangs and claws attack from all sides, leaving no room for retreat, no chance for rest.
Some claim the more sentient monsters consider Dagon something of deity, that they worship him, make him offerings of human sacrifices. It is difficult to say how much truth lies in this... Though it is clear he commands not just creatures of instinct and herd behavior, but also headstrong recluses such as ancient foglets and leshens.
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of Dagon taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
When it became clear that there would be a water god in the game, the choice of his name proved rather obvious. It should seem familiar not solely to Lovecraft fans, because Dagon, an ancient creature, is not only mentioned in the Old Testament, but was also worshipped as a water deity in Phoenician mythology.
In 'The Witcher', Dagon is a minor deity and ruler of the Underwater City. He is worshipped by the vodyanoi and a sect of swamp inhabitants. His horns, framing the head like an aureole, bring to mind ancient demons, while the embellishments on his body emphasize that the vodyanoi are a civilization of thinking creatures rather than another breed of monsters. Dagon's worshippers highly value precious stones, particularly turquoise. The vodyanoi use the latter to make decorative elements for their artworks, clothing and buildings. The eyes of Dagon's statue on Black Tern Island are made of this stone, which also appears in other parts of the temple and on the breast plates of vodyan mages and warriors. The god himself likewise wears turquoise-encrusted adornments.
As one would expect of a divinity, Dagon is a huge creature, towering above his worshippers and human alike. Only the golem's model is taller. His limbs are actually fins, rendering him a great swimmer, but rather awkward on dry land. As most of the time he lays dormant in depths where the sun does not shine, he does not rely on sight, and his eyes resemble narrow cracks. Dagon emerges from the deep only when summoned by ritual.
"With only slight churning to mark its rise to the surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters. Vast, Polyphemus-like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, ( ... ) bowed his hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds."
– H.P. Lovecraft, ""

&lt;/infobox&gt;
Like every evil, ancient god, Dagon needs loyal and fanatical followers who can give the world a taste of the impending doom that will ensue with the coming of their lord. Recruited from among the vodyanoi, Dagon worshippers do this perfectly — unless they run into a witcher.
In the game, Dagon worshippers are generally seen in the company of a Vodyanoi priest marauding about the Lakeside and Fields, or tending Dagon's altar on Black Tern Island. They are also called acolytes, especially when seen near the altar and considered to be "unfriendly" or "bad" vodyanoi.
They not only tend Dagon's temple but they also fight as protectors of their chosen deity.

Devourer

Devourer, or Black Annis, are said to derive from a tale of Baba Yaga where a man happened upon a devourer. If so, a disclaimer is required: the tale was softened. It provides only a faint idea of what can happen to a stray traveler who should have the misfortune of passing near a devourer's lair.

Combat tactics.
Quen helps guard against their attacks, but be mindful of rotfiends, which also like to join the fight and can quickly overwhelm you. A blizzard potion will help tip the odds in your favor and make the fight easier: after you build up your adrenaline points, the enemies will move in slow motion allowing you to avoid hits and makes attacks a lot easier.
Like their cousins, the rotfiends, devourers will explode when their health reaches a certain level. When you see them start to choke and their heads swell, back away quickly. Their death attacks can damage nearby enemies as well.
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the devourer taken from the Monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
Like the noonwraith, this monster is strongly rooted in Slavic lore. It began with a name mentioned by Sapkowski; the idea that the devourer should resemble an old, menacing woman followed soon after. The artist strove to create the ugliest possible hag, and thus was born the devourer. In its final form, the devourer is a hag with a wonderfully hooked nose, drooping breasts and a swollen, wrinkled belly. Its open mouth curves into a spiteful grin, and the protruding tongue and pulled back hair make it resemble a dog panting after a chase.
The devourer embodies children's nightmares of a mischievous, sadistic witch waiting to carry off naughty children.
In an illustration of one of Geralt's flashbacks, the witcher defends a boy from a devourer. The way she glares at the urchin explains the fear in his eyes.

Dog

Dogs are the carnivorous decedents of wolves that were domesticated by humans. While generally docile, they may become wild, cursed, unnaturally ravenous, or all of the above. In these instances, they are treated as predators.
After the Northern Wars in the 13th century, mass numbers of dogs died due to famine and their dead owners.

For the most part, dogs are domesticated pets, if they are treated well by their masters, they respond with loyalty and trust. However, dogs that are ill-treated will respond in kind.
A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading Fauna of the Northern Realms, Volume 1.
 "They say a dog's a man's best friend... But in these foul times one best be wary, even of his friends.– Alfred Pankratz, beggar from Novigrad"
 "Some claim dogs are reflections of their masters. A well-treated pet repays his owner with loyalty and trust, whereas an ill-treated one repays this treatment in kind as well, meeting yells with barks and kicks with bites. Since there is an abundance of bad men, so, too, is there an abundance of bad dogs. Most dangerous of all are the vagrant mutts who have lost all respect for men and developed a taste for blood and carrion."
 "Dogs usually attack in packs, choosing isolated victims, especially ones in whom they sense some kind of weakness. Packs of rabid dogs usually only dare attack children, drunkards, the elderly and cripples. Yet when backed into a corner, they will defend themselves with frothing bites and sharp claws against all and sundry."
Combat tactics.
As with all non-magical creatures, a steel sword is most effective against dogs. One known weakness is simply by coating your sword with beast oil, however the sign aard is also good for pushing back a singular, or even pack of, dogs, and because a the creature is lightweight, this works really well. They are also fairly susceptible to igni, catching fire due to their fur. Generally, one-on-one with a single dog is not much of a threat at all; it's a pack of them surrounding you that is the problem.
You have to drop each one quickly while simultaneously dodging out of range of the others coming at you from the sides and behind. Dogs are also particularly fast on their feet, and while they aren't all that strong, their speed and numbers can more than make up for it if you caught unprepared.

Drowned dead

Drowned dead (Polish: "Topielec"), is a more dangerous drowner variant. Like their cousins, they are found in and around bodies of water. It's commonly believed that drowners and drowned dead are criminals who met their ends by drowning, but this is false. In actuality, they're post-Conjunction creatures, making them entirely separate entities from humans and non-humans.

Drowned dead return in "The Witcher 2", however they are very rare and usually appear only at night near the site of Sabrina Glevissig's execution or near the bandit hideout. They are also classified as a subspecies of drowners. Drowned dead cease giving XP when killed from Level 15 onwards.
".
Drowned dead return in the third installment. They look largely the same in appearance with their counterparts in the second game and usually appear among five or more drowners.
They are found in Kaer Morhen valley, Novigrad, Skellige, and Velen.
In addition to the drowned dead, which is a rare monster, there is also its stronger, legendary variant - the Water Devil. It differs in appearance from the drowned dead by body coloring and fins on its head. Both monsters are vulnerable to steel and fire and are found in wetlands.

Drowners, also known as muire d'yaeblen in Skellige or vodniks, inhabit both natural and artificial bodies of water, from rivers and lakes to mill ponds and city sewers. It is commonly thought that these creatures are drowned men, somehow arisen from the dead to prey on the living.

The drowner, a frightful creature of mud and scum, drags people down into mires and bubbling eddies. It feeds on young women who bathe in rivers and on occasion will pull men off their horses or carts as they cross a bridge or weir. Drowners arise from the bodies of villains who meet their end in running water or in undertows that appear after storms. These watery creatures embody the spirits of those who can not rest after death and are sometimes born of fetuses aborted by magical means. They are ugly in appearance, skinny, tall and bony. Their bodies are slimy and green, as is their hair. Wherever a drowner steps, pools of their slimy substance form. This creature can be fought using ordinary weapons.
"Drowners are scoundrels who ended their wicked lives in the water. Drowned alive or thrown into deep water after death, they turn into vengeful creatures which stalk the inhabitants of coastal settlements."

They are quite often found at the banks of the Pontar, since the huge river with regular shipping and riverside villages provides them with ample sustenance."
""When monsters are really crappy, ganging up makes them happy". Drowners are not the mightiest beasts in the world, so they hunt in groups, in accordance with the above saying. They are surprisingly fast on land, but are a threat only to fishermen and washerwomen. They can best a witcher only if he is drunk or in love. Sometimes, however, a more robust specimen is found among the drowners. It is called a drowned dead and can command the entire band. Thus it's best to eliminate it first."
"One could say that if drowners chatted among themselves, Geralt would be highly esteemed among them after his exploits in Vizima. Yet drowners do not chat - they are dumb like a left shoe. And good. Fast style should be used when fighting them, and one must spin swiftly before they flee from a witcher's blade. Enough said."
"As they are already dead, drowners do not fear poisons, and even a large loss of blood makes no impression on them. This ends the list of the monsters' strong points, however, as the rest of the witchers' arsenal is extremely effective against them. Thus the drowners can be killed with fire, immobilized by traps, knocked down and, above all else, sliced and diced until slime spills from their ears."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the drowner taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher"​​​ for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
One of the most popular creatures in the game, the drowner is initially a worthy opponent, but become cannon fodder as the game progresses, an excuse for increasingly spectacular displays of Geralt's mastery of the sword. Frequently appearing creatures need to be created with particular attention to detail, so unsurprisingly we spent a lot of time refining the drowner's final appearance. This was probably the most often modified model in the game.
Skinny and humped, with its huge head, slightly protruding belly and concave chest, the drowner became a creature that is half-scary, half grotesque. Its eyes are round and fishlike, granting it a rather dumb expression. It also has wide palms and membranes between its fingers as well as a fin. Like its color, these elements reveal much about its natural environment. This creature clearly lives underwater and is awkward when on dry land... unless it happens to be hungry and there is an unsuspecting traveller nearby.

 "When at the water's edge, you gotta be quiet. First of all, so as not to scare the fish. Second "–" so you don't attract drowners.– Yanneck of Blaviken, fisherman"
 "A drowner resembles a corpse dredged from the bottom of a pond. It is sickly blue or green in color, with slime and sludge oozing out of every pore and the acrid stench of rot wafting off of it. That is why it is often thought drowners - along with their more dangerous cousins: vodniks, mucknixers and drowned dead – arise from the bodies of those who drown in shallow water: lost travelers falling into bogs, children who swim too far from the shore or, in the case of vodniks, inebriated peasants who stumble off narrow swamp trails."
 "Like so many other beliefs about monsters, this one is false. While drowners do look like humans from a distance, witchers, who have the dubious pleasure of examining them from close quarters, have reported the numerous ways in which their anatomy differs from our own. Their scaly skin, gills and dorsal fins suggest drowners and their like are an entirely foreign species."
 "The adaptations mentioned below make drowners excellent swimmers, well-suited to the muddy waters of the ponds and lakes in which they dwell. They often cluster near human settlements, which are for them an excellent source of food."
 "Cowardly creatures by nature, they usually stick to eating scraps they dig out of rubbish piles and animal carcasses. Yet if a lone traveler or careless fisherman strays into their territory, they turn from scavengers to fearsome predators. They can attack with lightning speed, taking their victim by surprise and pulling him into the water to drown. If not particularly hungry at the moment, they will keep their prey under the water for a few days, aging it until it grows deliciously tender and rotten. Drowners are particularly active at dusk and during the night, especially if the rain is falling – at such times they will even leave their watery homes and venture inland."
 "Drowners, mucknixers, vodniks and drowned dead all live in putrid, rotting filth, and so have developed a high resistance to poison. Though humanoid in form, they are primitive creatures no more intelligent than carp or pike. That is why spells affecting the mind, the Axii Sign included, are ineffective against them. Yet they are particularly vulnerable to magic drawn from the element of fire, including the Igni Sign."
Combat tactics.
Drowners are predominantly pack creatures by nature, usually in groups of three or greater. You know they have spotted you if they burrow into the ground. This is a sure warning sign that they're preparing to ambush if you encroach further on their territory.
Drowner's leaping attacks cannot be parried or countered, attempting to do so will momentarily stagger Geralt and render him immobile for several seconds, often enough for other drowners to land attacks on him. Their normal clawing attack on the other hand are susceptible to counterattacks, but doing so when multiple drowners are are landing hits simultaneously could be dangerous.
Drowners can evade normal and sweeping Aard rather effectively, and the only moment they could really be hit with Sign is during a very small window in a middle of leaping attack animation or if immobilized in some way. Axii on the other hand are often too slow to stun them, even when cast without interruption.
Drowners are quite weak to Igni, susceptible to being lit afire and stunned while they screech in agony. When attacked by multiple drowners, it's possible to catch the pack in a Yrden trap, then blast the drowners with Igni. You can counterattack the claw swipes from a drowner, causing a bit of extra damage to them.
However, this can be quite difficult when multiple drowners are attacking. Not only do they usually attack in numbers, their attacks are quite fast and can have surprising range as they usually do leaping jump-strikes; above all else, don't let yourself get surrounded by them. They can interrupt your counterattacks with their own attacks. Drowners try to leap at a witcher from beneath the ground. Watch for disturbances at your feet, and roll or dodge to safety. Drowners react to the deaths of their fellows by screaming in pain. This show of mourning leaves them defenseless for several seconds.

Fleder

Fleders are lesser vampires, but this description can be deceiving, for lesser does not mean weak and stupid. True, they are primitive and bear a closer relation to animals than to humans; but when they drop on their prey from above, they can be just as dangerous as their noble cousins, even to a witcher.
They are known by other names as well: kites and fliers to name only two.

The investigation has been discontinued and the deed attributed to a supernatural being.– fragment of a Toussaint Ducal Guard report"
"Fleders are classified as lesser vampires. Though weaker than the rest of their ilk in every aspect from the physiomagic to they physiognomic, they should not be underestimated – for they are very, very dangerous. Fleders cannot be mistaken for any other creature, with their wide, toothy jaws, flat, unpleasant faces and completely hairless, often warty bodies. These vampires mainly fight with their teeth and claws, flailing them blindly and not stopping even when their victim is already dead. Even a solitary fleder is strong enough to take down a trained soldier."
"Compared to other vampires, fleders display meager intelligence, seen most clearly in the mindless rage which causes them to try with all their might to attack and tear to shreds any weaker being."
"When fighting fleders, it is best to take advantage of their particular method of movement. These creatures do not run, but they do try to catch their prey and knock it over by leaping. Knowing this behavior, one can plan the fight appropriately and not let oneself be caught by surprise."
"They are vulnerable to vampire oil as well as Black Blood."
Combat tactics.
As said in entry from bestiary above, when Fleder attacks you, use a combination of dodges, Igni Sign and quick attacks on it and it will not be much of a problem. All you need to keep in mind is that it can leap.
Fleders as ekimmaras are especially dangerous foes due to their ability to regenerate. They can even outlast a witcher using the finest potions. Black Blood potions are an effective way to weaken any lower vampire, fleder included.
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the fleder taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher"​​ for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
The fleder is a lesser vampire. Its appetite for blood is the only thing it shares with the noble princes of the night. A creature with animal instincts, deprived of any human, it seemed inappropriate to make him a stereotypical vampire with flat, black hair and dressed in a long black coat. These obvious attributes eliminated, we had to devise features less typical of a bloodsucker. Its head – triangular, with a flat face and horn-like protrusions – renders it similar to a vampire. The concept art and model depicted certain bat-like features, including the monster's face and ears (which became horns). With its glowing red eyes the fleder also resembles a demon, while fans of Coppola's movie may note a similarity with the aged Dracula.
The fleder is not a good flier, the membranes under its arms allowing only short jumps and attacks from above. Though not particularly smart, it knows that it gains an advantage and increases its chance of victory by suddenly attacking unsuspecting victims. Since the fleder's arms are also wings, its hands have thin extensions that enable it to pin down its prey. The long, prehensile toes on the beast's feet allow it to hang head down from the ceiling as shown in the rendered image.

Frightener

The frightener (Polish: "przeraza") or chimera is a desert dwelling monster. It is nearly invincible, especially when controlled by a mage. Even witchers prefer to avoid fighting this beast if they can. Fortunately, this overgrown insect is sensitive to loud noises which deafen it and render it defenceless.
The first frightener was created by the mage Dagobert Sulla. After creating the beast, he is said to have exclaimed "What have I done?" and promptly destroyed it.

Upon beholding the abomination he had created, Sulla is said to have cried: 'What have I done?' He destroyed the monster; his notes, however, survived."
Monsterbook.
Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the frightener taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of "The Witcher"​ for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:
"Sapkowski never described the frightener in detail, but does mention its name. And what a name it is! A monster called "frightbringer" certainly should not disappoint players."
"The prototype of the creature was the praying mantis, a voracious insect famous for its cannibalism. The creature depicted in the black-and-white sketch was modeled after this arthropod. The colored sketch presents an array of colors — a common feature of dangerous and venomous creatures. Like the original insect, the frightener has a pair of highly developed forelegs — formidable weapons when it attacks the witchers of Kaer Morhen."
"Based on that first sketch, we created a model that we used briefly in the game. Yet, as the game evolved, the concept of the frightener changed as well. We needed a more massive, armored creature covered with earth-toned textures matching the grey walls of Kaer Morhen, where the frightener spreads destruction. In the second sketch the monster's torso resembles that of a beetle. The beast has also acquired wings that were not there earlier in spite of its mantis origins. Animations involving the wings appear in cut scenes and during combat with the creature. Also drawn from the beetle are its thick, armored legs and the "fangs" that encircle its head. The mantis-like forelegs and head survived as they merged smoothly with the other changes. Lastly, the frightener was given a new, final texture in shades of green. In this form it is ready to attack Kaer Morhen... and to die from the witcher's blades."
Visenna leafed through page by page, paying him no heed."Interesting", she said after a moment. "Eleven years ago, when you were banished from the Circle, certain pages disappeared from the Forbidden Books. It is fortunate they have been discovered — and annotated in the meantime. Well, I am amazed you dared to use Alzur's Double Cross. I doubt you have forgotten how Alzur ended. They say some of his creations still roam the world, including his last: the viy that maimed Alzur himself, destroyed half of Maribor, and fled into the forests of Riverdell." "Something Ends, Something Begins"
The Frightener is a legendary monster of the extreme difficulty level and it plays an important role in the game. It is vulnerable to silver and attacks by slashing the opponent with its sharp claws.

"Blood on the ceiling, guts on the walls... Must be a garkain.– Yan of Lan Exeter, investigator and Captain of the City Watch"
"Garkains, like fleders, belong to the class of particularly dangerous vampires whose strength exceeds even that of fiends. An encounter with one of their number almost always ends in death, which is why there are not many eye-witness accounts of them. From the city guard reports written up in Lan Exeter describing the attacks committed in that city in 1104 by three garkains (later killed by a certain Olivier of Gulet, witcher), it seems these horrible monsters do not content themselves with drinking the blood of their victims. The investigators concluded from the blood and guts strewn around the crime scenes that garkains tear their victims to shreds with great delight and muck about in their bloody entrails."
"Garkains belong to the group of creatures known as lesser vampires. They often gather around themselves members of other subspecies of lesser vampires, acting in such situations as leaders of the pack. They are by and large unable to run, but can jump a great distance and often attack their prey in that way. During combat, they usually keep their distance from their foes, trying to incapacitate them using a blast of mental energy provoking visions that beguile and disorient."
"Before grappling a garkain, one should drink the Black Blood potion and stock up on vampire oil. It should also be remembered that the Samum and Moon Dust bombs are always effective weapons against any mental attacks."

Like other vampires, Black Blood and vampire oil is effective against them. Garkains are also susceptible to the Samum and Moon Dust bombs.

&lt;/infobox&gt;Frustrating jobs happen in every profession. Golem contracts are just such a job for witchers, as they involve slashing through solid rock animated by magic. Luckily, what is brought to life by a lightning bolt can very well be destroyed by one. This is something we all truly wish the golem, from the very bottom of our hearts.
In the game, Geralt finds an old golem cemetery in the swamp with four or five of the beasts "frozen" in place. As it happens, he must re-animate and then kill one of them to complete the main quest in Chapter II.
 "Once an absent-minded mage created a golem, animated it by casting Alzur's Thunder, and ordered his new servant to fetch water, before burying himself in his scholarly books. The golem kept carrying water day and night, without pause, and ultimately flooded not only the mage's house, but the whole city. As you can see, my young students of the Art, improper use of tools and a lack of elementary training may cause a tragedy."
 "Anabelle Radfind, Lectures on Security and Hygiene in Magic"
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the golem taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia:"
The golem is often portrayed as a clumsy, faceless figure made of clay or as a perfect effigy of a man. Neither of these ideas was suitable to the world of The Witcher. Ultimately, our golem became a piece of roughly hewn rock animated by a magical obsidian heart placed inside the beast's chest by its maker. The mage who created it was no sculptor; he cared little for aesthetics and focused on functionality. This creature was meant to work and defend its master's property. And the golem performs these tasks (especially the latter) perfectly, with ruthless efficiency.
The hero encounters the golem in the swamp forest, near the Golem Burial Ground. The creatures stands still, frozen in mid-step, having expended all the power which animated it. Geralt's task is to bring the creature to life, which he does by summoning a storm with the help of friendly druids. We obviously drew the concept of a thunderbolt giving life to inanimate matter from the story of Doctor Frankenstein's monster. Having Geralt yell "It's alive!" was too tempting to pass up. The golem is thus inspired both by the legend of a rabbi from Prague who created an artificial human being and by Mary Shelley's novel. This combination fits our world of grim and gritty fantasy.
There are two types of golem in " referred to in the journal as Earth elemental and Fire elemental.
There is also a sentient Talking Golem in Dearhenna's laboratory beneath Loc Muinne.
"The Witcher Battle Arena".
Golem was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA.
"We don't know much about this ancient creature. Where did he come from? What's the purpose of his existence? The only thing known for certain is that he is a ruthless killing machine, who can mix physical and magical attacks. His passive skill, Stone Armor, allows him to get into the fray, and he gets more armor and magic resistance the longer he stays in battle."
"Summon Gargoyles - Golem's first skill, as the name suggests, summons a gargoyle which lands on the ground causing damage to all within its radius and slows them down. Then the creature starts to follow the closest enemy, only to explode when it reaches him (or after a few seconds), dealing even more damage."
"Stone Pillar - this skill is perfect for controlling opponent's moves. The Golem strikes the ground with all his might, causing a small tectonic rift, that travels in the pointed direction, pushing enemies to the sides. At the end of the rift a stone pillar erects from the ground, dealing extra damage and further moving enemies to the sides."
"Contravention - Golem's special skill needs to be used carefully. It's very easy to perform (you just have to tap the button), but choosing the right moment is the greatest challenge. When used, The Golem explodes into pieces which start to rotate really fast, drawing all enemies in the vicinity to the centre.

The bestiary entry can be obtained by reading Golem, or Man's Most Faithful Servant.
 "If want[] us to break through this wall, we're gonna need twenty sappers, seven mules and a hundredweight of saltpeter. Or one golem.– Vilmir Brass, foreman at Mount Carbon"
 "Golems are mindless matter brought to life by a spell. They obey their creator's orders without question. Their boundless strength, ability to withstand pain, endless patience and the fact that they neet not one jot of food or drink makes them the best servants or guards anyone could ask for. Once provoked, they will not tire of battle until they have either crushed their opponent or themselves crumbled to dust."
 "Defeating a golem is extraordinarily difficult: for obvious reasons it does not bleed, it feels no fear or mercy and it is invulnerable to fire and poison. What's more, a golem's body is as hard as the rock it is sometimes heft out of, so even a silver blade will barely wound it. The monster's only weakness is acid – a blade covered in acrid oil can thus increase one's chances for victory."
 "Golems use no weapons, for they have no need – their fists, weighing over a hundred pounds each, can crush solid granite with one hit. A blow from a golem should thus be avoided at all costs – there is no shield that can stop it, nor sword that can parry it. That is no easy task, for these creatures are able to move with surprising speed. Luckily, their enormous mass means they are not very agile – once a golem begins a charge, it cannot stop quickly, a fact experienced witchers use to their advantage."
Combat tactics.
Do not attempt to parry the punches delivered by a golem. The sheer weight and power behind them renders such thinking suicidal at best. A charging golem cannot be easily stopped, but a clever witcher can use this to their advantage. Roll out of the golem's path, then strike.
Yrden is useful when going toe-to-toe with a golem, but remember that the golem is merely slowed, not helpless. They can still fight despite Yrden's effects, and can still interrupt a witcher's swordplay with a single crushing blow.
Like other elementals, a golem can pound the ground with such ferocity, anyone standing near it is knocked prone. Also similarly, when golems feel vulnerable, they may crouch and protect themselves with their arms, becoming invulnerable to frontal blows. However, that also exposes their back, allowing a witcher to freely strike at it with great effect.
Surprisingly enough, a fully developed Whirl attack combined with the effect of Thunderbolt potion and elementa oil can in fact devastate a golem, as the creature's size prevents it from evading Geralt's attack, and its vulnerability to the knock-back effect mean that once caught inside the whirling storm of silver blade, it cannot back out or retaliate as long as Geralt has the stamina to spare.

Graveir

Graveirs are a species of necrophage, and the cousins of ghouls. Unlike their smaller cousins, these creatures can be distinguished by the three bony combs on their skull, blunt claws, strong teeth and a long tongue for feeding on marrow. The smallest wound from a graveir will infect you with corpse-venom, which can cause death if not treated.
There is no greater delicacy for the graveir than marrow from the cracked bones of a dead man. When feeding, this creature becomes very attentive to guests. A witcher appearing during lunchtime, silver sword in hand, can expect to be invited to join the meal — sadly, though, not in a manner that in any way conforms to the general rules of hospitality.
Andrzej Sapkowski.
A graveir is a type of ghoul. It looks very much like a ghoul but is considerably larger. He can also be told apart, as you can see, by these three bony combs on his skull. The rest is the same as any other corpse-eater. Take note of the short, blunt claws, adapted for digging up graves, and churning earth. Strong teeth for shattering bones and a long, narrow tongue used to lick the decaying marrow from them. pg. 97 "Blood of Elves" (UK edition)

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Graveirs are depraved, lecherous and treacherous bastards. Larger than ghouls, they have three bony combs on their head and short but cruel, thick claws. Their teeth and thin tongue allow them to eat marrow — and the more rotten and rancid the marrow, the more it is to their liking. The vile graveirs have cadaverine in their teeth, so anyone who engages one in battle beware. Graveirs fear fire, silver, and magic, but weapons of steel cause them no harm.
 "After the war with Nilfgaard, graveirs became a real plague. Until then the monsters were familiar only to specialists and professional beast killers, thus everyone mistook them for ghouls. Today, any child could give an accurate description of a graveir, and people who have passed near battlefields or necropolises offer first-hand accounts of the horrible murders committed by these ruthless necrophages."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the graveir taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
Half-dead, half living creatures, ghouls are scary, miserable and repulsive at the same time. They feed on human corpses and hide from sunlight in the dark crypts. Graveirs are their larger cousins and can by no means described as miserable. They are just plain scary.
The graveir's hefty, strapping silhouette suggests it is no normal necrophage. Closer examination reveals some chilling details. Its hard, stone-like skin is covered with dry blood. Its most striking features include its small eyes and a low-set head that makes the graveir look dumb (which it is indeed). With its small mouth full of curved, uneven teeth, it easily crushes even the thickest bones, and it possesses a long tongue useful for sucking out marrow, its greatest delicacy.
Vetala is an unusual graveir, one endowed with human features, a keen intelligence, and the ability to speak. When Geralt encounters him on one of his adventures, he ponders whether to kill the creature or to leave it be as an intelligent being capable of rationally justifying its way of life.

Greater Brothers are creatures unique to "The Witcher".
These mutated knights are clad in heavy armor and wield humongous shields, making them tough nuts to crack, even for a witcher. The only thing worse than a Greater Brother would be a monster that uses weapons with great skill and demonstrates mastery of complex combat tactics.
 "With great pride and full responsibility I must state that the experiment was successful. The race of super humans we need more than meets our expectations and will satisfy Jacques de Aldersberg. Their combination of intelligence, endurance and brutal force tamed only by loyalty to the Flaming Rose is the future of the world."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the Greater Brother taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
The hero encounters these mutated knights of the Flaming Rose toward the end of the game. The madman who subjected them to mutation dreamt of creating better, stronger, more resistant and obedient human beings. He fulfils his dream only in part, for his knights become something very near to monsters.
When Geralt spots these armored beasts alongside normal knights, he sees first hand the terrible effects of their mutation. To strip these monstrous and gloomy mutants of a measure of pathos, we jokingly christened them "Greater Brothers", a name that would ultimately remain with them.
The concept drawings present the beings' evolution. They are protected by heavy armor that only creatures with overdeveloped muscles and unnaturally strong bones could possibly wear. Wings are attached to the spiked spaulders, bringing to mind military banners and evoking the image of hussars, a type of light cavalry.
The armor they wear and the shields and maces they carry remind us that they were once knights of the Order. Obviously, the size of these devices has been adjusted to the monstrous scale of their bearers. Their allegiance to the Order of the Flaming Rose is indicated by the emblem on their chest, vivisible in the colored sketch.

Ifrit

Ifrits or afreets are genies from the Plane of Fire. When summoned, they generally do not grant wishes, unless the summoning party wishes to die or to have someone killed. These creatures are undoubtedly intelligent, but mortals can not penetrate their minds. That is just as well, because their visions of an all-encompassing inferno would most certainly drive any human mad.
Large golems fueled by the element of Fire, that is the Fire Elementals, are sometimes dubbed ifrits, but have nothing in common with the real ones.

Kikimore

Kikimore, or kikimora, is an insectoid monster species that lives underground, as well as in swamps.
Andrzej Sapkowski.
He didn't react to the muffled cry of the woman selling vegetables who was staring at the bony, taloned paw sticking out beneath the horse-blanket, bobbing up and down in time with the donkey's trot.
Caldemeyne shifted from foot to foot, looking at the spidery shape with its dry black skin, that glassy eye with its vertical pupil, the needle-like fangs in the bloody jaws. pg. 75-76, "The Last Wish" (U.K. edition)
"The Witcher".
The Wonderful World of Insectoids provides the in-game journal entries about the various forms kikimores come in, as well as all the useful parts one can harvest from their carcasses.
There are three castes of kikimores in the game:
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the kikimore taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game" "The Witcher" "for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
Monsterbook.
Insects are probably the most inspiring prototypes for monsters. Repulsive yet intriguing, they are weird and "fantastic" even before their forms are modified. We had to have huge arthropods in The Witcher, but it was clear from the outset they could not simply be giant versions of existing creatures.
We devised the concept of the kikimore when somebody suggested introducing social monsters to the game. The kikimores are organized not unlike a termite colony. The queen lays eggs from which soldiers and workers then hatch. Soldiers defend the colony from enemies, while workers build structures and supply food. This division of roles had to be reflected in the games' AI mechanisms: workers turn aggressive only when attacked or when aggression is artificially induced in them, while soldiers fight any enemy they spot.
The beasts' physical appearance underlines their different places in the hierarchy. Workers are smaller, modelled after spiders, though the similarity is not obvious. The characteristic shape of their limbs and cephalothoraxes suffices to evoke repulsion.
Kikimore soldiers resemble beetles. They are more massive and protected by thick, chitinous armour. Their horned heads and torsos, as well as the sharp thorns on their legs, clearly demonstrate them to be dangerous creatures.
The queen bears more resemblance to the soldiers, mainly because of her bulky body. She is a mass of insect abominations that is almost impossible to defeat in direct combat. She has no eyes, which would be useless at the bottom of her dark lair. The pieces of flesh that resemble ribs and hang from her abdomen (visible in the rendered image) can either be ovipositors or atrophied limbs that have no use in her function as a constant reproducer.
"The Witcher Adventure Game".
While playing "The Witcher Adventure Game" also kikimores will cross your path.
Successful Sword: Receive 1 VP.
Failed Sword: Suffer 1 Heart for each Shield you are short.
"Blood and Wine" expansion.
Two types of kikimores appear in "Blood and Wine", the second expansion for "":
Their main ability is that, whenever their attacks hit, Geralt's toxicity level increases. If left unchecked, this could cause damage over time and, in extreme cases, render Geralt unable to consume any more potions. It is therefore recommended to have White Honey on hand to cancel the effects of toxicity whenever fighting Kikimores.
However, if the player is relying on high-duration decoctions in order to increase damage, which is a common strategy in Alchemy-based builds (and to a wider extent, any build that utilizes Euphoria), White Honey can significantly weaken the player's damage and force the player to meditate after the fight to re-consume his decoctions. So try to move and dodge as possible in order to avoid their attacks.
They are also vulnerable to insectoid oils and Igni. Kikimores almost always attack in large numbers, with several workers accompanying one warrior.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;No enemy is more terrifying than the King of the Wild Hunt, who leads a horde of ghastly riders across the sky. Doom incarnate, he fears no opponent, for he can always decide that his adversary is doomed, which usually determines the outcome of any clash. Over the course of the game, Geralt has several opportunities to meet the King, as his every step is dogged by the specter.
Over the course of the game, the King taunts Geralt each time they meet by twisting everything the witcher has done in an attempt to have our hero doubt himself and his own motives.
It is heavily implied that the Wild Hunt is pursuing Geralt as he runs through the forests near Kaer Morhen in the Prologue. In Chapter I he appears in the Outskirts along with the ghost of Leo. In Chapter IV, Geralt must be careful "not" to summon him while completing a quest for the Hermit. These encounters culminate at the end of the game and true to form, the witcher is faced with another dilemma, as the King has come to claim the soul of Jacques de Aldersberg.
"I am persecuted by the Wild Hunt, a cavalcade of ghostly riders on skeletal steeds. Leading them is the King of the Wild Hunt, the harbinger of war and despair. I know he seeks me, but I don't know why."
"The King of the Hunt appeared again and appointed one of his wraiths to fight me. He exploited a weakness — the wraith was the specter of Leo."
"The spectral sovereign appeared in the village of Murky Waters near Vizima. I'm certain his appearance heralds disaster."
"The King of the Wild Hunt appeared in the Grand Master's vision. I now know that I'm not the only one haunted by fate. The ghostly king seeks Jacques de Aldersberg as well, and wants his soul perhaps even more than he wants mine."
"I fought the King of the Wild Hunt for the soul of Jacques de Aldersberg — in the Ice Plains, I defeated the specter."
Journal entry.
 This journal entry is given by reading the book The Wild Hunt.
During his final conversation with Letho, Geralt recalls his forgotten memories, remembering that Eredin found him and Yennefer at the Isle of Avalon after Ciri rescued the two from the riot that took place in Rivia. The Hunt attacked Geralt and Yennefer soon after, taking the sorceress captive after laying waste to the island.
Geralt had began searching for Yennefer, along the way he gathered the witchers of the Viper School and engaged the Wild Hunt in an attempt to rescue her but the Hunt far outnumbered them. So Geralt offered his soul in exchange for Yennefer's, to which Eredin agreed without hesitation.
 "According to Nordlings, the Wild Hunt is a procession, or rather a cavalcade of skeletal horsemen. They rush across the sky on the bony remains of steeds. Clad in rusty remnants of armor, they wear jagged swords at their waists. Like comets, the Wild Hunt is an omen of war, which has been confirmed beyond all doubt."
 "The spectral cavalcade ventures out in search of victims every several years, but its harvest was never as rich as just before the last war with Nilfgaard, when over twenty souls went missing Novigrad alone after the Hunt passed through. Curiously, elven and dwarven legends make not the slightest mention of the Wild Hunt."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the King of the Wild Hunt taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
"This powerful being leads a retinue of wraith raiders in their mad rush across the sky. The Wild Hunt, like a comet, is considered an ill omen, a harbinger of disaster and war. The King of the Wild Hunt is an unusual opponent, if only because he is from another world — a fact well known to Sapkowski's fans.
"When we decided that the King of the Wild Hunt would appear in the game, we knew he had a serious part to play. From beginning to end, this nightmarish ruler appears on Geralt's path as an oppressor and portent of misery. The King of the Wild Hunt is linked to the forces of Destiny: he hovers just outside the main narrative, only appearing to remind the witcher of painful events or to provoke difficult discussions.
"Our protagonist's most powerful opponent is thus one of the game's most important and mysterious characters. The King of the Wild Hunt wields a scythe — an attribute of death. Beneath his ragged robes, he wears elements of an ancient suit of armor. The ornaments on his clothing and crown evoke associations with flesh—eating maggots."Astride the horse skeletons sat skeletal riders wearing rusty plate armor and chain mail, shredded coats, and dented and corroded helmets adorned with bullhorns and headdresses of ostrich and peacock feathers. Beneath their raised visors glowed the specters' bluish eyes. Their tattered banners rustled. At the head of the demonic cavalcade galloped an armed wraith, a crown upon his helmet, around his neck a pendant beating rhythmically against the breastplate. "The Tower of the Swallow"
Behind the scenes.
Legends and myth about the Wild Hunt have origins in ancient Northern and Central Europe folklore, in our real world. According to myth, the Wild Hunt is a hunt or chase of spirits and other supernatural beings, all completed with hounds, horses and huntsmen.
It represents an omen of danger, misfortune or catastrophe, or simply the personification of human fear. It's also cited in cinema, music and literature.

Koshchey

A koshchey is created through rituals such as Alzur's Double Cross or Fregenal's Triangle within a triangle, vile rituals known to some sorcerers. It is a member of that infamous group of gigantic beasts that can cause destruction on a massive scale while killing droves of people. Neither a crab nor a spider, it is tough as nails. Even a witcher might find the soft meat inside hard to get at. The most well known Koschey was created by Alzur's double cross, the Viy of Maribor.
The first koshchey was created by an ex-druid called Fregenal using either the Triangle Within a Triangle or Alzur's Double Cross and destroyed by Visenna using the Mirror Effect spell.

&lt;/infobox&gt;
In the game, Geralt encounters the koshchey, the result of much labor, during one of the boss battles. It is a formidable foe and there is no escape from its chamber other than killing the beast.
 "What, in your opinion, is the best way to describe a koshchey?"
 "Death. I'd call it death."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the koshchey taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:
This monster owes its name to Russian folk tales, in which Koshchay the Immortal is a murderous sorcerer who renders himself immortal by concealing his life's essence inside an egg. He does eventually perish — when the egg itself is shattered. In Sapkowski's short story A Road with No Return, the koshchey is a nearly immortal monster, or at least one that proves extremely difficult to kill — all by virtue of having been created through a magic ritual known as Alzur's Double Cross, which also made the beast enormous in size. In the story, the protagonists barely manage to kill the creature: in the game, Geralt must face this challenge alone.
While working on the concept art and model of the koshchey, the artists looked to the animal world for inspiration, as they had in creating the kikimores. Sapkowski describes the beast as possessing the features of an arthropod — half-arachnid, half crustacean. It moves surprisingly fast for its size and sudden strikes of its forelegs would surely instill terror in anyone suffering from arachnophobia.Korin turned to look. From behind the rubble, about a hundred paces away, emerged spidery legs with lumpy joints. A moment later, over the pile of stones came a torso, minimum six meters wide, flat as a plate, clay-colored, rough and covered in barbed growths. Four pairs of legs strode forward steadily, dragging the bowl-like corpus the scree. The fifths pair of legs was disproportionately long and armed with huge pincers studded with sharp thorns and spikes. "Something Ends, Something Begins"

Mutant

Mutants are creatures that did not occur as a product of natural evolution but as a result of mutating an existing creature by mages or spontaneous effect of the Chaos. Many such monsters were created by organizations such as Rissberg or Salamandra.
Perhaps the most recognizable mutants are witchers, created by Alzur and Cosimo Malaspina to fight monsters.

Mutant Assassins are creatures unique to "The Witcher".
Mutation and training makes witchers excellent killers. The problem is their conscience, which prevents them from carrying out political assassinations or causing terror among common folk. The laws of the market say that if there is demand, it must be satisfied as soon as possible, which is why Salamandra created the mutant assassin.
Out of all the other mutants created by salamandra. They look like human in good shape with only few differences. most of them were beardless and bald with some havin them, their ears were human or animal, their nose had one hole, they had fangs and their eyes were either white or red or yellow. On their faces they were a metal pice, light armor or a shoulder armor and all of their weapons were light.
 "Unflappable confidence, strength and courage – these are the greater brothers' mottos. These virtues are indispensable for victory, but not sufficient on their own - basic rules of war must not be ignored. While forming new units of knights we need to remember about auxiliary divisions, which will provide the army with more flexibility on the battlefields around the world."

 "Nightwraiths exude this immense sadness, this helpless wraith... I fear them, same as anyone. But most of all I feel sorry for them.– Aelline Altsparr, elven trobairitz."
 "Compared to other creatures of the night – katakans, nekurats and werewolves, for example – nightwraiths (and their rarer cousins, duskwraiths) might not seem all that dangerous. After all, one might ask, how much harm could a pale, withered woman in a tattered dress do? The answer: quite a bit. Instead of finding this out the hard way, avoid crossing fields and meadows at night at all costs."
 "Like noonwraiths, nightwraiths are only found in rural areas. Travelers fall victim to them most often, but if legends are to be believed they also sneak into huts at times and murder peasants in their sleep."
 "When they attack nightwraiths remain immaterial for most of the time, meaning physical blows pass right through them. They only take on more tangible form for the brief moments in which they strike. When weakened, they will create several projections of themselves which cannot attack directly but act as transmitters of sorts through which the nightwraith can sap her victim's vital energy."
 "Nightwraiths can turn immaterial and are at such times very difficult to wound. In order to force one to take on corporeal form, trap it with the Yrden Sign or hit it with the blast of a Moon Dust bomb."
 "Do not believe the old wife tales and think yourself completely safe from nightwraiths during the day. They appear under the light of the sun as well - but are much weaker then than after dusk."
Combat tactics.
Nightwraiths favor the dark. If you seek to claim a bounty on a nightwraith, you have to meditate until the moon hangs in the sky. Unfortunately, this is also when the nightwraith is at its strongest. If you are patient, you can find a nightwraith during the day, when it is at its weakest. Mostly incorporeal, a nightwraith must be made corporeal, either through Yrden, or Moon Dust bombs. When forced to become corporeal, silver swords can be employed to finish the wraith off. They are susceptible to Specter Oil.
When weakened, a nightwraith can split into three copies of itself. Destroy these with all haste, during this state the nightwraith saps vital energy from nearby sources. Bombs and crossbow bolts can destroy nightwraith doppelgangers. Upon entering a cloud released by a Dimeritium Bomb, they will immediately dissolve. Destroying the copies forces the real nightwraith to reveal itself.

 "Noonwraiths are born at high noon out of heat, sadness and the sweat of ploughmen. In the hot air above the fields, they gather to dance madly, creating air vortexes, but the specters dislike being watched. Those who peep are forced to dance with them."
 "Noonwraiths stop their dance when the sun goes down, once the abducted mortal is long dead from fear and exhaustion."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the noonwraith taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of" "The Witcher"​ "for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
Crops swaying in the fields on a windless day indicate that a noonwraith is nearby. These monsters kill humans who venture into the fields at noontime, thus, farmers return home or seek shelter in the shade at this time of the day.
Our noonwraith appears in picturesque location known simply as the Fields, where not a drop of rain has fallen in a very long time. We could not resist including this traditional Polish folk creature in our game, especially since a good part of the story plays out in rural areas. In a conceptual sketch, the noonwraith wields a sickle – a symbol of the harvest and of working in the fields.
The noonwraith is a sun-burned old woman. Clothed in a linen, she hovers just above the ground, her hair white from constant exposure to the sun. Streaks of light drift about her, and when necessary she uses these to blind her opponents. The noonwraith's frock and shoes suggest she once was a young girl, who venturing into the fields, joined in a spectral dance and thus entered the spirit world as a wraith.
The final illustration depicts a nightwraith, a creature that haunts the fields after dusk. The nightwraith resembles the noonwraith in many respects: she rules the Fields after dark and is associated with the moon. This creature is a dark reflection of the noonwraith, which is emphasized by colors chosen for the illustration.

 "Despite what is commonly thought, peasants do not interrupt their labors at midday to get out of the sun – they do it to avoid noonwraiths.– Vlad Reymond, Peasants and Their Customs"
 "On particularly searing summer days, when the sun reaches its zenith, wraiths will at times appear, resembling sun-scorched women dressed in long, white robes. These are noonwraiths – the spirits of young women and girls who died violent deaths right before their weddings. Driven mad with pain and anger, they wander the fields searching for their unfaithful lovers or backstabbing rivals, though they will kill anyone who does not get out of their way in time. They are often held in this world by some object of intense emotional significance. That is why, if one ever finds a wedding ring or torn veil in the middle of a field, one should not pick it up, but instead back away as quickly as possible."
 "Noonwraiths are only known to haunt rural places, and usually stay near the place of their deaths. They prey on peasants working in the fields or children playing nearby."
 "Noonwraiths do not bleed and are for the most part immune to the effects of Witcher Signs. They can create mirror images of themselves which circle their victims in a kind of morbid parody of a dance. This ghastly ritual drains their victims' life energy while adding to their own strength. Noonwraiths are also able to manipulate the physical world to a limited degree, kicking up clouds of dust which temporarily blind and disorient their opponents."
 "Noonwraiths can turn immaterial and are at such times very difficult to wound. In order to force a noonwraith to take corporeal form, one must first trap it with the Yrden Sign or strike it with a Moon Dust bomb. Once the monster has regained physical presence, one can mount a fast attack with a silver blade, preferably one coated in specter oil."
 "Contrary to popular belief, noonwraiths can also be encountered at night, but are much weaker then than during the day."
Combat tactics.
Noonwraiths are similar in nature to nightwraiths, save for their preference of the sunlight, and a greater mastery of physical attacks. They can blind foes with dust they kick up.
Noonwraiths can also create copies of themselves when threatened, consuming the lifeforce of their victims until they are destroyed. Bombs and crossbow bolts can destroy noonwraith doppelgangers. Upon entering a cloud released by a Dimeritium Bomb, they will immediately dissolve. The Yrden sign or the Moon Dust bomb forces a noonwraith to become corporeal and vulnerable.

Werewolves are therianthropes who transform into wolves or half-wolves. As other such creatures, they are hardly hurt by steel but very vulnerable to silver.
There are two most common ways to aquire lycanthropy: the first one through a curse and the second is to simply have a werewolf parent. Being bitten by another werewolf, while popular in folk tales, gives only a very small chance of becoming one in reality, though it is still recommended to get magical treatment. Those who are born as werewolves are able to fully control their shapeshifting abilities, while those cursed or bitten change into their werewolf form only during the full moon. Those who became werewolves during their lives however are the only ones who can be cured. The wolfsbane is said to mitigate the illness' symptoms.
Therianthropy diseases, including lycanthropy, appeared in the world after the Conjunction of the Spheres, affecting nonhuman and early human populations alike. According to Herbolth, lands in the Toina valley, also called the Dogbane, were plagued by werewolves before the Nordling colonization.
Werewolves have a legendary sense of smell, exceptional even amongst real wolves. Lycanthropes are usually on good terms with other canines, but hate werecats.

&lt;/infobox&gt;In the game, the werewolf is not only a boss monster, but also the subject of a quest. It is up to our hero to determine the werewolf's true identity.
"Baron Wolfstein buried his face in his hands. His heart was throbbing. Suddenly the scent of his wife's blood and the blood of his children intensified. The baron's body swelled as his muscles grew, his noble attire fell in tatters on the marble floor. 'My beloved, you... you are so hairy. You are a werewolf!' Bianca went pale. 'What about our love?' In reply she heard a terrifying roar."

Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the werewolf taken from the Monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game ​"The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
At first, lycanthropes, including werewolves, were supposed to be ordinary, frequently encountered opponents in the game. When we realized that the curse of lycanthropy could be the basis for a fascinating story in the spirit of Sapkowski's tales, we decided to make the werewolf an unusual creature.
We were inspired by early drawings that depicted a lycanthrope with a large "gut". We immediately linked the creature to Vincent Meis, the tough commander of the City Guard, a middle-aged man with a well-developed "beer-muscle". New motifs were added to the story until it became a tale of a righteous law enforcer who uses the lycantrophy to fight crime more effectively. The werewolf must ultimately choose between being a masked (and fury) avenger or devoting himself to true love. Geralt can help him resolve this dilemma while proving that in addition to killing monsters, witchers are also good at lifting curses.
Werewolves are among the opponents Geralt faces in the arena introduced in version 2.0 of "The Witcher 2", beginning with the seventh fight.
In the Enhanced edition, one werewolf can be encountered in the forest cave during the quest Crown Witness. Players need to pick up Dorian's Diary in order to trigger the encounter.

A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading In Beast's Clothing.
Monster introduction by CDPR:
 "Neither animal, nor man, the Werewolf takes the worst from both species: the bloodlust and primal nature of a wolf, and the ruthlessness and cruelty of a human. One becomes a Werewolf as a result of a curse thrown by a witch -- the change itself is uncontrollable and unwilling. A man who transforms back to his human form can't usually remember the atrocious acts committed as a werewolf."
 "Werewolves are creatures of the night and they are especially active during the full moon. They usually go hunting alone, as there rarely is an opponent that can match their strength, agility and fast health regeneration. If a Werewolf actually encounters an enemy that has equivalent strength and can fight a fair fight, the creature can call for wolven reinforcements that will come to its aid. A good way of dealing with werewolves is a sword covered with oil to combat cursed creatures, or a Silver Bomb that will temporarily block the creature's regenerative power."
 "Wolves aren't as bad as they're made out to be. Werewolves, though – they're every bit as bad and worse.– Elsa Vilge, archer"
 "Werewolves are creatures with both men and wolves inside them. When in beastly form, they take the worst traits of each: the wolf's drive to kill and hunger for raw flesh and the man's cruel and calculating intelligence. A werewolf's condition comes about through a curse, and the transformations happen outside his conscious control. When he reverts to human form, he has no memory of his deeds – otherwise he would surely go mad and take his own life."
 "Werewolves are active at night, particularly when the moon is full. Though they hunt alone, when threatened they will summon wolves to aid them. Werewolves rarely feel the need to flee, for few adversaries put up much of a fight against them. They strike as swiftly as lightning with claws sharp as razors and regenerate any damage received in mere moments. When fighting werewolves a witcher should wield a blade covered in oil harmful to the cursed and have a large supply of Devil's Puffballs handy."
 "A werewolf's curse can at times be lifted, yet there is no universal, surefire method for doing this. A witcher seeking to undertake such a task must there equip himself with a great deal of patience – and sturdy armor."
Combat tactics.
These breeds of cursed creatures are quite fast and very lethal. They can jump great distances and at such high speeds that defending yourself against one can be challenging at best. Utilising the sign Yrden can be a useful way to slow them down, making close quarter combat safer. Igni and Axii can also be used to stop the werewolf on its tracks momentarily, leaving enough windows for one or two heavy attacks.
Werewolves have an intriguingly powerful health regeneration ability, even more potent than ghouls'. Players who are unable to give enough damage output within short time will have to be prepared for an exhausting fight, if not at all impossible; as long as the werewolf can regenerate health faster than he takes damage, it can outlast Geralt no matter how good he is in defense and evasive tactic.
Fire, bleeding and poison effects can be used to slow their regeneration down, although inflicting these statuses upon the werewolf are quite a challenge in itself, considering their speed.

Wolves are the ancestors of dogs, hunting these wild animals is generally the job of the king's foresters, but occasionally a witcher while travelling through the wilds may find himself up against a pack of these animals. Just like any beast, he must deal with them swiftly and carefully.
"There was so much snow that winter that we had to dig tunnels just to get to the privy and had icicles in our pants by the time we got back. Wolves came out of the forest, ate the cattle and then surrounded the house. They were howling madly. Surrounded by that pack of wolves, we felt like three little pigs."

Wolves can be found throughout the mainland and on the Skellige Isles. They also appear during contracts or in quests, serving as the allies of leshens and werewolves. Several Skelligers also keep tamed wolves as pets, alongside more conventional dogs.
A bestiary entry can be obtained by reading Fauna of the Northern Realms, Volume 1.
"Friend of mine used to say that with all these griffins and basilisks and whatnot, good old fashioned wolves weren't nothing to worry about... Then the damned beasts devoured half his flock.– Yngvar, shepherd"
"Once upon a time wolves were the absolute rulers of the forest. Men used them to frighten children, while adults, too, trembled at the sound of their howling. Post-Conjunction monsters not only pushed wolves into the deepest wilds but also took over their place in human nightmares. Yet this does not mean the old predators ceased to be a danger. Wolves do not have a drop of magic within them, breathe no fire and spit no acid, but that in no way stops them from killing unwary travelers and hunters."
"Particularly dangerous are wargs, a nasty and ferocious subspecies of wolf, and the snow-white wolves which today can only be found in the wild highlands of the Skellige archipelago."
"Wolves usually feed in packs counting from a handful to over a dozen members, though some particularly strong males hunt alone. Though wolves are weaker than many post-Conjunction monsters, they make up for any lack of strength with their intelligence. When fighting them one must be especially careful not to become surrounded. The presence of wolves can also signal more serious trouble – these predators often share their hunting grounds with werewolves and leshens."
Combat tactics.
Wolves hunt in packs and coordinate with one another in order to surround their choice of prey. Beyond this group coordination, wolves are similar to dogs in the manner in which they attack, where occasionally the leader will be a warg as opposed.
There are multiple schools of thought about engaging a pack of wolves. On one hand, you can parry all of their attacks as long as you hold down the parry button, and can counterattack with the proper timing. On the other, they'll happily attack so frequently and from so many directions that you won't have time to counterattack. Creating openings to halt their momentum is the key to efficiently defeating them, and your Signs are the best tools to make that happen. Which sign is the most effective is up for debate.
You can choose Yrden to slow down attacking wolves, which makes counterattacks easier to time and dodging and punishing more likely to succeed before being interrupted. The downside to this strategy is that it requires you to hold your ground, as getting forced out of your protective circle renders the sign useless. This can be done by simply parrying their attacks, but the more time you spend defending, the less time you'll spend attacking and making use of the slowdown.
If one finds themselves surrounded, you can use Igni and Aard to try and drive the pack off, even if just for a moment, which allows the you to recover some of your stamina and/or regain control over the fight. Wolves tend to have low resistance, which means they'll often catch fire or be knocked all the way to the ground by your Signs. With a few of the wolves momentarily disabled, you'll be able to either target their few remaining buddies, or strike a devastating blow to a downed wolf that can't defend itself. The downside to this tactic is that if enough wolves happen to resist burning or knockdown, or you fail to strike enough of them at once, you'll find yourself still overwhelmed by attacks and now unable to cast a Sign.
Leshens are able to command entire packs of wolves to aid them in battle. The wolves that are summoned by a leshen must be fought with silver swords. The wolves will be struck and killed by the leshen's own attacks, so if you see the leshen preparing to use the tree roots against you, try to roll in a direction that kites the wolves to the attack.

Sometimes witchers must put to rest ghosts who haunt the living. Wraiths appear near cemeteries or in homes they inhabited during their lives. They usually have no memories and are guided strictly by hatred towards the living. May they rest in peace.

"If you want to get rid of a wraith, you must first find its body. Try searching on unhallowed ground or in the corner of the cemetery where outlaws are buried. When you dig up the corpse, you will discover that it is not rotten and that there is blood on its lips. Pierce the corpse with an aspen stake, cut off the head and place it between the corpse's legs. To make certain that the wraith will never return, set the corpse on fire. One false step will mean your demise."

Wraiths abound in the second installment of the game. They are first encountered in the burned down hospital in the forest outside of Flotsam. Many more can be found in and around Vergen. Specifically, in the dwarven catacombs and on the battlefield.
In addition to the standard wraith featured in the journal entry, other wraith variants include the Aedirnian/Kaedweni soldier wraiths found exclusively in Chapter 2 and the Nilfgaardian soldier wraith featured in the Chapter 1 quest In the Claws of Madness. Unlike traditional wraiths, the variants will flail around when set on fire affording Geralt temporary respite while they are out of action.
The Aedirnian/Kaedweni soldier wraith gives XP when killed up to level 23.
"The wraiths are not, as some claim, a projection of an inner fear. They are visible, tangible and dangerous on top of that. The priests teach that people who die suddenly, leaving this vale of tears with important tasks left unfinished, become such ghosts. So wraiths have their own aims. Sometimes they are unaware of them, but more often they aim to achieve them, not caring for the living."
"The wraiths are always connected to the sites of their demise. They may protect their former homes, or they may seek vengeance. One may even find small groups of the wandering damned in crypts and catacombs or on battlefields. It is not true that they only appear at night. I can confirm, however, that one cannot communication with them, and that they have no fear of man or monster."
"Wraiths hover just above the ground, so they move very swiftly. One should strike at them strongly and make ample use of Signs. As immaterial beings, they can appear and disappear at will. If the witcher swings his sword too slowly, giving the ghosts time to react, he might find himself striking nothing but air and then sense a quick riposte on his back."
"Wraiths do not bleed, and common poisons cannot harm them. They are, however, susceptible to fire and of course to silver. The best means of fighting a wraith is the so called Specter Oil, which should be used to coat a silver blade."

Wraiths are usually encountered at night, near cemeteries, catacombs and other such burial places, or else near the places that were important to them in life: abandoned homes, crumbling castles or forgotten bridges.
Wraiths suffer endless, indescribable pain. Filled with anger and a sense of having been wronged, they both envy the living and brim with overwhelming hatred for them. Like other specters, they are immaterial, meaning they are not harmed by fire, poison or designed to provoke bleeding.
 "Finish all your business before you die. Bid your loved ones farewell. Write your will. Apologize to those you've wronged. Otherwise, you'll never truly leave this world.– Paule Vikar, peasant healer, advice to a dying man"
 "Clerics and scholars are forever debating whether spirits do in fact journey to another world after death, one where eternal joy or suffering awaits. Both groups agree, however, on what happens to spirits who, for one reason or another, remain in our world after their body breathes its last: they transform into wraiths. To hear their mournful howls, one can surmise this is not a fate to be envied."

 "Wraiths can turn immaterial and are at times very difficult to wound. One can, however, force them to reassume a physical presence by trapping them with the Yrden Sign or by hitting them with slivers from a Moon Dust bomb. As with any such ghostly being, one should fight them using silver swords, preferably ones smeared with a thick coat of specter oil. Note as well that wraiths are particularly dangerous on moonless nights."
Combat tactics.
Relatively fast melee fighters, wraiths can do serious damage if they get in close, and they can easily do so with their ability to teleport short distances. If they do teleport while they are somewhat close to Geralt, dodge in any direction away from the wraith. They like to teleport right next to their target and immediately start swinging, inflicting heavy damage in an instant if they catch you.
A wraith attacks victims with sword in one hand, and a lantern in the other and they can use both instruments in a spinning attack consisting of three separate strikes that are hard to get out of. Fighting a group of wraiths makes it especially dangerous as Geralt can get seriously injured in an instant if caught within a flurry of wraiths slashing him simultaneously.
Like other wraiths, these specters can turn incorporeal at any given time, rendering attacks from silver swords much less effective. One can, however, force them to re-assume a physical presence by trapping them with Yrden or by hitting them with a Moon Dust bomb. Take caution however that Moondust bombs only disable their ability to turn incorporeal, not their teleportation.
Investing in Specter Oil is also a good strategy, as wraiths are rather difficult to hit and the oil helps make each successful strike count that much more.

Wyvern

In a grossly small cage, curled up in a ball, lay a lizard covered in dark, peculiarly adorned scales. When the beaked one struck the cage with his rod, the reptile thrashed about, running its scales across the bars. It stretched its long neck and emitted a piercing hiss, demonstrating sharp, white, conical teeth that contrasted starkly with the nearly black scales around its maw. pg.75 "Time of Contempt" (U.K. Edition)
Wyverns (Elder Speech: "Vyverne") are an endangered species of ornithosaur with snake-like necks and long tails that end in a venomous trident, adorned almost fully in dark scales. Their menacing teeth allow the creature to swoop down from the sky, easily snatch their prey and carry it off to their nest, not caring if it is a sheep or a man.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;In the game, wyverns do not appear until Chapter II, where they are initially restricted to Wyvern Island in the northern part of the swamp.
 "Wyverns are unlucky to be frequently mistaken for dragons. Seeing a reptile approaching a flock of sheep, peasants panic. They expect it to breathe fire, massacre everyone and abduct the local virgins. While it is true that wyverns hunt sheep, they neither breathe fire nor lay waste to whole villages. And they are completely indifferent to virgins."
 "Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the wyvern taken from the Monsterbook which was enclosed with the Collector's Edition of the computer game "The Witcher"​ for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
 Ordinary folk often mistake wyverns for dragons. Witchers, however, immediately recognize these flying lizards, which tread upon the ground on two heavily-muscled legs. They also know that when fighting this beast, they must avoid the venomous stinger at the end of its tail and its jaws that bristle with deadly teeth.
 The concept for the wyvern emerged from the human fear of reptiles. With its flat head and long neck, the creature resembles a snake; its extended tail only strengthens this impression. The dinosaur-like hump on its back makes it all the more terrifying. The bright colors of the sketch immediately suggest a venomous creature. Thin, long spikes seem to protrude directly from its curved spine, and along with the beast's general posture serve to emphasize its malicious and treacherous nature.
 If you are not a witcher, you had better not mess with the wyvern.
 On one of his quests, Geralt has a chance to fight alongside a group of these beasts. It is a pleasure to witness the destruction they spread amongst foes unfamiliar with the ways of fighting these fearsome creatures.

A bestiary entry can technically be obtained by reading Death From Above, but the book doesn't appear during gameplay.
 "Most dangerous of all are the royal wyverns. Or, as they're called in some circles, the royal pains in the arse.– Albina Tottelkampf, lecturer in natural sciences at Aretuza"
 "Wyverns are often mistaken for dragons, and, though they are much smaller than their more famous kin and do not breathe fire, they are likewise extremely dangerous monsters. Especially feared are the so-called royal wyverns who, like their namesake monarchs, are exceptionally ornery and extremely deadly."
 Unobtainable without reading the book:
 "A wyvern will usually attack from the air, aiming to knock its prey down with its wings. After landing it will attack with its tooth-filled beak, trying to draw attention away from its most dangerous weapon: the stinger found at the end of its long tail. A strike from this carries the risk of poisoning from powerful toxins. Even a witcher's body experiences wrenching pain when injected with wyvern venom, and so it is worth preparing oneself with suitable potions ahead of time."
Combat tactics.
Wyverns are quite venomous, they are able to spit their venom from a distance and even inject it directly into its victim through the stinger on the end of its long tail, the use of Golden Oriole can prevent it from incapacitating you. They will fly around their prey, well beyond crossbow range, before they will swoop down at break neck speeds in an attempt to claw at their victim.
Aard and Grapeshot can bring a wyvern to the ground, though they are tough enough to be resistant to crossbow bolts, but other more lethal munitions can force it to the ground.
Once on the ground a wyvern will prefer to strike with the talons on its feet, its teeth and its tail. It is possible to parry the bites, but if unsuccessful the consequences can be deadly. The don't appear to be very good at dodging while on the ground; an unending series of Fast attacks has been seen to keep them off balance so they don't attack right to the point that they die.

Royal wyvern

Royal wyvern — this larger and more dangerous breed of wyvern is highly aggressive and venomous. The creature is particularly terrifying because it has no fear of even throngs of peasants armed with pikes and pitchforks. This is especially true when it is feeding.

Royal wyverns appear in "". An unusually large specimen lives near a trading route, attacking travelers and caravans.
 "It were huge. And those teeth, ugh! We barely escaped.Wonder if it killed the traders... Whoresons sure had it comin',– Conversation overheard in Velen"
 "A hunter who knows his prey's habits and behavior will rarely return from his hunt empty-handed. To know what forest paths deer are like to trod, to know in what muck boars will wallow, to guess when a hare will emerge from its burrow - that is half the battle."
 "What most men do not know is that some monsters also possess such knowledge. For example, a royal wyvern from Velen had learned the danger of exposing itself to human eyes and arrows by flying high to pick out its prey from afar. Instead, it would lurk by the roadside and wait for military transports. In this way it grew fat on salted pork and beer, expanding until it resembled a dragon more than other, lesser members of its own kind."
 "The witcher thus knew this beast would be much stronger and more resilient than a normal wyvern. Even one blow from it could kill - which is why he would need to avoid its charge at all costs. He would also be wise to force it to the ground with his crossbow or a bomb whenever it tried to fly into the air and hurtle down in a deadly dive."
 "In the end the witcher slew the hideous creature, though not without some difficulty. Thanks to this feat, the soldiers could once again send shipments of food and equipment needed to conduct the war. Whether that was a good or a bad thing - that is an entirely different matter."

An intelligent, talking ghoul is a rarity. And yet from time to time one encounters a specimen that ruins the reputation of the rest of the species by soliloquising over dead bodies and engaging in cogent discussions with witchers. Rumour has it that evolution equipped Vetala with a dangerous weapon: he can talk people to death. That rumour is not necessarily an exaggeration.
"The Witcher".
He can be found feasting on remains, in the ruined church in the center of the cemetery in Chapter III and again in Chapter V in a safe house in the Temple Quarter.
 "Vetala is a mythical beast, invented by the common people. Tales about him are typical examples of urban legend, spread by word of mouth, which grow increasingly fantastic with each retelling. Vetala is believed to be an intelligent ghoul or graveir who lives in the city cemetery as the absolute ruler among scavengers. Not only does Vetala speak the human language, he is also known for his sophisticated manners. Vetala is said to prefer corpses over living flesh. He rarely attacks humans and demonstrates unusual courtesy on the rare occasions when he does."
 "I met a talking ghoul, a real freak of nature."
 If Geralt decides to kill Vetala:
 "I decided to kill him, for despite his eloquence he was still a monster, a threat to humans. And I'm a witcher."
Journal entry.
During the secondary quest "Harassing a Troll" in the third game, if Geralt chooses the first option when talking to Boris the rock troll, Geralt will mention that he once met a talking ghoul.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Vodyanoy, also known as the fishpeople or fish-eyed creatures, are an intelligent race living in underwater cities at the bottom of the Great Sea, where their civilization is most advanced, as well as the Pontar river and its tributaries.
They share the ocean with nereids and merpeople, the latter of which they treat with the utmost respect and occasionally fight.
Culture.
Inhabiting entirely different conditions, vodyanoy developed an advanced civilization unlike any other. They know the arcana of metalworking, utilizing them to forge swords, spears, axe-like weapons and helmets. Vodyanoy are also fairly efficient masons capable of not only building cities but also vast steps which lead to them.
They worship many deities and take religion very seriously. Two of such deities were the powerful Lady of the Lake and her enemy Dagon, a cruel being awaken and killed in 1270. Land dwellers know little about the majority of these cults and what is known inspires fear in them. Vodyanoy hold their priests, capable of using magic which they believe to come from deities of the deep, in high esteem. Vodyanoy are also worshipped themselves as the Water Lords by a small human cult.
Characteristics.
Vodyanoy are scaly humanoids with muscular legs that allow them to run nimbly even on dry land. They have spherical bulging eyes described as iridescent and cold, betraying no emotion. On the other hand, their immensely broad maws full of conical teeth tend to resemble a cruel smile. Vodyanoy also have huge combs on their heads which make them look larger.
Living deep underwater, vodyanoy absorb oxygen through gills which get dilated when exposed to air. To survive on the surface for longer than few minutes the vodyanoy wear breathing masks.
Monsterbook.
Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the vodyanoy taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic:
The race of the underwater creatures described in the short story 'A bit of Devotion' is undoubtedly intriguing: a civilization thrives in the depths of the sea, developing in parallel to those on land. This motif provided an opportunity to tell a tale of two worlds colliding. In the game, relations between the vodyanoi (inhabitants of the Underwater City whom humans contemptuously refer to as "fishpeople") and the villagers of Murky Waters are tense. A mysterious deity named the Lady of the Lake and, of course, our protagonist Geralt of Rivia, step in to mediate.
The sketches depict members of two vodyanoi castes as well as acolytes of the menacing water god Dagon. The artist concentrated on clothing and accessories in an effort to emphasize the distinctive nature of the underwater civilization. The priest wields a staff and wears a high hat with straps of leather falling on his shoulders — objects resembling the staff, miter and vestment of a bishop. His mask and the bracelets on his hand emphasize that the vodyanoi know metallurgy and view metal as a rare and valuable resource. The remaining elements of this ceremonial outfit feature more common materials: his belt is made of oyster shells and stones, the straps of his vest of leather, his stone-encrusted breast-plate of wood. The stones have a religious significance connected with the cult of the water god known as Dagon.
The vodyan warrior wears a lighter outfit. His armor does not restrain his movement, enabling him to fight ably both underwater and on land. As vodyanoi absorb oxygen naturally only from water, he wears a mask that allows him to breathe on land. Modeled after old gas masks, this breathing apparatus grants the warrior and all vodyanoi a singular appearance.
The straps and plate on the warrior's chest are also lighter. They are not armor, but (as in the case of priests) religious objects. The netting evokes connotations with water and was probably looted off of fishermen during a raid.
In the early development stages, vodyanoi — as opposed to other monsters — were supposed to use weapons, hence the harpoon in the sketched warrior's hand. This idea was ultimately abandoned: even though they are thinking creatures, fishpeople use their claws in combat.
The third sketch depicts a vodyan dissident and worshipper of the menacing water god Dagon. The schismatic and his comrades emphasize their autonomy by wearing a different mask, one modeled after a knight's helmet. The breastplate is larger than that worn by warriors because Dagon's acolytes consider themselves to be priests.
"The ocean is vast, Agloval. No one has ever seen what is there, beyond the horizon, if there is anything there at all. The ocean is larger than any wilderness to which you have exiled elves. It is less accessable than any mountain or valley where you might have massacred bobolaks. And there, at the ocean bottom, lives a race that uses weapons, knows the secrets of working metal. Beware, Agloval. If archers begin following the divers to the surface, you will provoke a war with something you know nothing of. The thing you wish to disturb may prove a hornets' nest. I advise you to leave them the sea; the sea is not for you." "Sword of Destiny" (UK edition)

<doc id="2160" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2160" title="Zeugl">
Zeugl

Zeugls inhabit sewers predominantly, feeding on sewage, and grows at an alarming rate. The beast is always hungry, so it reaches out with its tentacles for living creatures and tries to shove them into its huge maw filled with multiple rows of teeth. The zeugl is paralyzingly hideous, foul-smelling, and surprisingly strong for something resembling a rotten potato, so it usually manages to devour its opponent.
Geralt was hired to rid the sewers of a zeugl during his and Yennefer's stay in Aedd Gynvael. There is also a breed of zeugl mutated by Rissberg mages called parazeugl, which in turn is not at all dangerous and cleans the sewers.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
In the game, the zeugl is one of the boss monsters. Geralt must face this ugly beast in the Vizima sewers during the Epilogue, and this time, the tentacles seem to have a mind of their own! Luckily our hero is not forced to face the beast alone.
Journal Bestiary entry.
"The zeugl is the best example of a monster that has grown accustomed to human settlements. The beast feeds on the waste and filth produced by the city, so it need not hunt or fight to survive. It simply grows and gradually becomes a danger to people. This shows how detrimental continued degradation of the natural environment can be in the long run. Therefore, I implore the reader: respect nature."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the Zeugl taken from the monsterbook, which was included with the Polish, Hungarian and Czech Collector's Edition of "The Witcher" computer game:"
This huge monster inhabiting the sewers beneath Vizima looks like a medieval environmentalist's nightmare. It feeds on the garbage and carrion that slowly drift with the flow. The zeugl can grow to be enormous in size, and being a hermaphrodite, it reproduces easily. A fully grown specimen is a serious threat to humans and very difficult to kill.
Only the top part of its body and tentacles ever surface above the sewage - and these are the most important elements of its design. The black on red sketches present the creature in all its glory. Sapkowski described it as a "hideous bulge" - and such is our zeugl. The concept artist provided it with a fish-like head and a few rows of sharp teeth suitable for grinding whatever reaches the monster's jaws. If the victim is not quite dead, the zeugl's tentacles feature spikes that allow the creature to pull its prey into its mouth.The debris exploded in an geyser of thick, stinking grease, clay pot fragments, rotting rags and pale shreds of pickled cabbage. From beneath it burst a huge bulbous body, resembling a rotten potato. It slapped the air with three tentacles and the stub of a fourth. (...) The body glided toward him, plowing through the debris like a barrel being rolled to market. He saw the tuber crack as it opened its wide maw full of large, razor-sharp teeth. He let the tentacles wind themselves around his waist, lift him from the stinking grease with a thwack, and drag him towards itself spiralling ever deeper into the debris (...) The tooth-lined jaws snapping wildly and angrily. "Sword of Destiny"The sketch above focuses on the zeugl's cephalothorax - the monster's head resembles that of a fish, while the folds on its back bear a likeness to mushroom caps.

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Frozen Reflections is considered a secondary quest, but it is unavoidable narratively. It is triggered by Geralt's entrance in the Cloister of the Order of the Flaming Rose. It is received automatically as Geralt enters the Cloister to speak with the Grandmaster.
Walkthrough.
Our hero has just fought his way through a now blazing Temple Quarter and a zeugl-infested sewer, not to mention several greater brothers with the help of his ally (Yaevinn, Siegfried or Triss) and then inside the gates of the Cloister of the Order of the Flaming Rose. Now for the Grand Master... Geralt confronts Jacques, whom he finds surrounded by those few "selected" by the Order to receive sanctuary inside the Cloister. De Aldersberg makes one last (conventional) attempt to convince the witcher that his plan is for the "good" of mankind, but our hero will not be swayed.
This results in both Geralt and Jacques being transported to a dream world of the Grand Master's making, the Ice Plains. De Aldersberg explains that what Geralt sees are the remains of Vizima, now more or less encased in ice and snow. He lays out how his grand plan was to gather "humanity" and migrate south to avoid this precise eventuality. Of course the fact that any non-humans would be stepped on in the process poses no moral dilemma for the delusional. The witcher quite rightly cuts to the heart of the matter and exposes the insanity of this plan. Seeing that he can not convince Geralt, Jacques summons a number of ifrit to deal with the witcher and teleports away.
Having dispatched the immediate threat, Geralt realizes that he can not go back. He can only proceed further into this strange vision. He moves on and is soon joined by an unexpected ally.
If Geralt sided with Shani: Shani appears and tells him that they are currently inside a projection of a madman's mind. This is the Grand Master's twisted vision of the future. She promises to help the witcher by accompanying and healing him as he continues on his journey. She also tells him that any death here will be very real, despite the "unreality" of the setting.
If Geralt sided with Triss: Triss appears and tells him that they are currently inside a projection of a madman's mind. This is the Grand Master's twisted vision of the future. She promises to help the witcher by accompanying him as he continues on his journey. She also casts "Lightning Storm" on him which causes blue thunderbolts that will strike any opponents they meet along the way. She also tells him that any death here will be very real, despite the "unreality" of the setting.
Together, they move on, fighting skullheads along the way, until they reach an ice bridge and Abigail appears.
If Geralt saved Abigail: She tells Geralt about future generations of humans and the news is not good at all. She also gives him five Swallow potions.
If Geralt left Abigail to be lynched: After giving Geralt the news that these anthropoids are the descendants of humanity, she informs him that she intends to avenge her own death and our hero is forced to fight her specter.
But more obstacles have yet to be overcome. Our team moves on, this time encountering wraiths of the hunt, skullheads, as well as being subjected to more raving by the Grand Master. Geralt can discern twisted versions of his own words in these sermons but he casts aside any doubts and keeps going. And what journey would be complete without an appearance by the King of the Wild Hunt? That wraith just can not help himself! The usual sort of exchange ensues.
It seems that Jacques is not content to leave his argument stand and throws yet another curve ball in the witcher's direction.
Appease Toruviel: Toruviel appears and enchants Geralt's swords with the magic of fire, a useful thing in this ice-bound realm.
Insult Toruviel: Toruviel appears and she decides to fight alongside you for a short while.
Appease Rayla: Rayla appears and when Geralt tells her that there are worse things than death, she joins the team.
Insult Rayla: Rayla appears and when Geralt tells her that their relationship is in the past, she casts "Soulcatcher" on our hero which restores his vitality with each opponent killed. She then disappears.
Appease Celina: Celina appears as a nightwraith and casts a magic shield that drains energy from any enemies and passes it to Geralt.
Insult Celina: Celina appears but Geralt tells her that she could have chosen better which displeases her, but she still joins the team.
This event is followed by a few more encounters with some monsters and yet another "conversation" with the Grand Master. He does go on! There is really nothing new, he is still delusional and Geralt knows it, but Jacques keeps disappearing, forcing our hero to forge ahead lest he be consumed by the deadly blizzard dogging his heels as he climbs ever higher into the icy mountains. De Aldersberg pulls every trick he has to try to persuade Geralt: guilt, self-doubt, flattery, ... anything. More skullheads, wraiths and mutants attack as our duo advances until the past once again rears its ugly (revisionist) head:
The ghost of Siegfried has some pretty choice words for the witcher. He presents his views in the most unflattering light and forces a fight to the death.
The specter of Yaevinn is the angry injured party here and picks the fight, but still winds up dead.
The spirits of both Yaevinn and Siegfried show up to disparage and attack our poor witcher, but even two of them are no match for Geralt.
More mutants. Then, suddenly, Alvin appears, but says nothing. Geralt is again tormented by his past decisions and the consequences of his choices, but he keeps moving, only to be "rewarded" with yet another lunatic rant by the Grand Master. The monsters that follow are actually a welcome relief from the evangelizing. Just when things seem endless, some unexpected help materializes.
If Geralt saved the striga/princess: Princess Adda appears in the form in which she feels best - as a bloodthirsty striga and offers her assistance to the witcher.
If Geralt killed the striga, but not the werewolf: Vincent appears as a werewolf and offers to fight at Geralt's side.
If Geralt killed the striga, "and" the werewolf: Who would have expected Count Roderick de Wett to appear? But he does, claiming to share the same convictions, the same objectives, the same enemies as the witcher. He also offers to help in the upcoming battle, and any help is good help at the moment.
After a spectacular leap across a collapsing ice bridge, Geralt and his entourage now must face some Knights of the Order as well as a few greater brothers. Once the battle is over however, his allies inform him that they can not follow him farther into the Grand Master's vision. The witcher must go on alone, but that is what witchers do anyway. He proceeds into the ruined temple and faces de Aldersberg who still chooses to hide behind smoke and mirrors.
As Geralt approaches, Jacques first summons a ring of greater mutants which surrounds our hero, forcing him to fight them first. Seeing that his first ploy was wasted, the Grand Master then surrounds the witcher with a magical (and deadly) ring of fire complete with ifrit. Our hero is not so easily stopped though, and makes his way to his target. The two men finally face each other, but just as Geralt manages to knock Jacques to the ground, the King of the Hunt decides to interfere. Are we surprised? I should think not!
The specter spins all of Geralt's choices so far in the ugliest possible manner and throws each and every one of them back in the witcher's face. He also demands the Grand Master's soul for himself. Another choice!
Geralt has had enough and kills the King of the Wild Hunt: It is a tough fight, but of course our hero prevails.
Geralt, disgusted with everything, leaves him to it: He lets him take the Grand Master's soul.
Geralt then proceeds to eliminating the wounded Grand Master once and for all. He draws his steel sword and attempts to deliver the fatal blow when the Grand Master, in a last pitiful attempt at saving his life, uses magic to deflect the blade and sends the sword flying out of reach. Without any hesitation, Geralt then draws his second silver sword and while he positions the blade right on top of the terrified Grand Master, the latter objects that this sword was only made to slay monsters. Of course, it couldn't have been more appropriate.
Back in the real world once more, Geralt is met by Dandelion who has been standing vigil the whole time unable to do anything but wait. The bard points out that the Grand Master is indeed lying dead, just a few paces away in the courtyard of the Cloister. They discuss what became of Yaevinn (or Siegfried, or Triss) and then the witcher searches the remains of Jacques de Aldersberg, retrieving the stolen secrets and revealing an amulet, identical in every way to the dimeritium amulet Geralt had given Alvin in Murky Waters, only much older and worn.
So ends the quest and the game. Geralt has recovered the stolen witchers' secrets thereby completing the mission Vesemir gave him.
Phases.
Snow and Ice.
Vizima is ice-bound, all is covered in snow. The Grand Master claims this awaits us in the future... I must proceed, find an escape or a way to disperse this illusion. "I must move on and face the Grand Master no matter what appears in my way."
If you sided with Shani: Shani has come to help me. She claims that I am inside a vision born of the Grand Master's mind. She promised to aid me by treating my wounds. I must go on and find the Grand Master. "I must go on carefully - death here will be very real."
If you sided with Triss: Triss claims this world is the Grand Master's vision of which I am a part. I must move on carefully, as death here will be very real. Thankfully, the sorceress decided to assist me with her magic. Blue thunderbolts will strike my opponents. "I must go on carefully - death here will be very real."
If Geralt saved Abigail: So these huge anthropoids are the remnants of humanity? I wonder what else awaits me in this strange land. "I must go on, pay no heed to the ghosts of the past."
If Geralt left Abigail to be lynched: Abigail claims these anthropoids are the descendants of humanity. I think she wants to avenge her own death. I will have to fight her. "A fight with Abigail is unavoidable."
The Spirit Defeated.
I defeated Abigail, or rather her spirit. I can proceed. "I must go on, pay no heed to the ghosts of the past."
Anthropoids.
So these huge anthropoids are the remnants of humanity? I wonder what else awaits me in this strange land. "I must go on, pay no heed to the ghosts of the past."
A Conversation with the Master.
The Grand Master's words seem familiar, though I'm not sure to what... I can't let myself be deceived by his visions. I must move on. "I cannot let myself be deceived by the Grand Master's visions. I must go on."
The King of the Hunt.
I spotted the King of the Wild Hunt. That can't be a good sign. It's getting colder... I must move on. "Death follows me. I must go on."
Toruviel / Rayla / Noonwraith.
(Appease Toruviel): Toruviel appeared on my path. She enchanted my swords with the magic of fire, which might prove useful in this ice-bound realm. "I need to move on before I freeze."
(Insult Toruviel): Toruviel appeared and decided to join me. "I need to move on before I freeze."
(Appease Rayla): I met White Rayla. She decided to join me. "I need to move on before I freeze."
(Insult Rayla): Rayla appeared on my path. She has cast a magic shield around me that drains energy from my enemies and passes it to me. "I need to move on before I freeze."
(Appease Celina): I met a noonwraith [should be nightwraith]. She cast a magic shield that drains energy from my enemies and passes it to me. "I need to move on before I freeze."
(Insult Celina): I met a noonwraith. She decided to join me. "I need to move on before I freeze."
Another Conversation.
I've heard this speech about nonhumans before... If I could only remember where... The Grand Master speaks with great conviction, though his words are the ravings of a mad man... "I must move on. He cannot flee eternally."
Siegfried's Spirit / Yaevinn's Spirit / The Spirits of Siegfried and Yaevinn.
Siegfried's spirit attacked me. I must defeat him to move on. "I must defeat Siegfried's ghost."
Yaevinn's ghost attacked me. I must defeat him before moving on. "I must defeat Yaevinn's spirit."
The spirits of Yaevinn and Siegfried attacked me. I must defeat them before moving on... "I must defeat the ghosts of Siegfried and Yaevinn."
The Duel.
This land distorts everything, even memories. It is empty, cold, the wind is biting... If it is the reflection of the Grand Master's thoughts, of his soul, I can begin to understand his behavior. Understanding doesn't necessarily bring forgiveness. "The way is clear, I can move on."
Alvin's Spirit.
I saw little Alvin's spirit. I wonder where he is now... "I cannot be distracted. I must go on."
The Master's Eloquence.
Where does he get these ideas? Well, no point in debating him. I must fight him as soon as I'm able to catch up. "It won't be long now. I can feel it. Onward."
If you saved the striga/princess: Princess Adda in the form in which she feels best - as a bloodthirsty striga. "I've gained an ally. She'll be useful during the fight ahead."
If you killed the striga, but not the werewolf: Vincent, true to form. A tough, cynical cop whether in uniform or covered in fur. I'm glad I met him of all people here. "I've gained an ally. He'll be useful in the fight ahead."
If you killed the striga, and the werewolf: De Wett. Surprising... He claims we have the same convictions, the same objectives, the same enemies. Perhaps... One thing is clear, we wound up at opposite ends of the same sword. Unlucky for him... "I've gained an unlikely ally, one who's sure to be useful in the fight ahead."
The Heart of the Vision.
I'm nearing the heart of the Master's vision. I must go alone. The confrontation draws near. "I must go alone. The confrontation draws near."
Fighting the Master.
Somehow I doubt we'll make a deal. We can only fight. May the best man win. "I must defeat the Grand Master in combat."
Kill him: I defeated the Grand Master. Evidently, that wasn't enough as I must now face the King of the Wild Hunt. That's like fighting death itself. "I must now face the King of the Hunt".
Don't kill him:I give Spirit of the Grand Master Of The Order Of The Flaming Rose to the King of the Wild Hunt and i don't need to fight him.
The Return.
In the real world again... I must recover the stolen secrets and end this story. The Grand Master should have them. "To end this story, I must recover the stolen secrets. The Grand Master should have them."
Stolen Secrets.
I've recovered the stolen witchers' secrets, completing the mission Vesemir gave me. Time to close this act. I wonder if Dandelion will find it inspiring... "Something ends, something begins" (10000 XP)

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
The Ashes of Vizima is a quest which is automatically received upon completion of Chapter V; it launches the Epilogue. At this point, Geralt's Paths essentially converge; only the absence or presence of certain key players, whose lives have been impacted by Geralt's choices, varies.
Walkthrough.
Having just found out that the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose is behind Salamandra, the witcher and his ally (either Yaevinn, Siegfried or Triss) head back to Vizima to inform the king. Geralt's path has already affected the political landscape in Temeria (and abroad) and those consequences are mentioned in his exchange with Foltest.
Politics aside, Geralt brings the king up to date on what he has found, and is urged to finish the job for 8000 (10000, less an appropriate amount of income tax). The witcher then sets out, still aided by his ally, to find the Grand Master at the Cloister and finally retrieve the stolen Witchers' Secrets. Along the way he encounters friends and allies, frightened refugees, mutant assassins, greater brothers and a zeugl.
Phases.
Meeting the King.
It looks like Foltest made a deal with Radovid, the king of Redania. They want to take control of the situation together. I must speak to the king, protect Yaevinn from being arrested. Maybe news of the Grand Master's betrayal will work... "I must inform the king of the Grand Master's betrayal."
It seems Foltest has found a new ally in Radovid, the king of Redania. I must tell the king of the Grand Master's treason, but convince him that not all the Order's members have betrayed its ideals. "I must inform the king of the Grand Master's betrayal."
It seems Foltest is negotiating with Radovid - Temeria cannot take control of the situation on its own. I must tell the king of the Grand Master's betrayal. "I must inform the king of the Grand Master's betrayal."
Hunting.
The king promised me 8000 orens for killing the Grand Master. I must make my way through Vizima to the Cloister. I'll find him (the Grand Master) there, and I'll slay him... "I must break through Vizima to the Cloister. The Grand Master must die... "
Dandelion.
Dandelion is staying behind - to compose more of his absurd songs recounting current events. I must go on, hunt down the Grand Master in the Cloister. "I must go on and hunt down the Grand Master in the Cloister."
An Invitation.
I should follow this man. He may know a way through the building's cellar. "The streets are too dangerous. I'll look for a passage through the cellars."
The Key.
Our host claims we can get to the next building through the cellar, bypassing a long segment of burning streets. I must search for the key, which supposedly is somewhere in the building. "I must search for the key to the cellar. It's supposed to be somewhere in the building."
The Way through the Cellar.
I have the key to the passage through the cellars, which will save us time and effort. "I'll move on through the cellars."
A Madman.
Upstairs we met a man who has clearly had to endure too much... He claimed we can leave the building through the window. "According to the man, we can leave the building through the window."
Yaevinn lives:
I managed to convince Yaevinn that I'm not to blame for Toruviel's death. I think he understood what I meant. It's time to move on. "Time to move on, but I sense a fight ahead."
Yaevinn dies:
Yaevinn died because he refused to renounce his hatred. It's time to move on. I shouldn't linger here, it's dangerous. "Time to move on, but I sense a fight is imminent."
Knights of the Order or Scoia'tael or Mutant Knights.
We met some soldiers preparing for a fight. Apparently there are knights of the Order around. We must teach them a lesson. "There are some knights of the Order around and we must teach them a lesson."
Yaevinn and his Scoia'tael are dead. The path is clear, we can move on. "We can now proceed."
The greater brothers came through the inferno. I doubt we'll be that lucky. I must talk to Triss, figure out what to do next. "I must talk to Triss about how to move forward."
The Sewers or A Wounded Knight or The Zeugl.
The wounded knight wheezed something about getting to the Cloister through the sewers. He also mentioned that a zeugl guards the passage. I got a key from him. Time is running out, we must descend into the sewers. "Time is running out, we must descend into the sewers."
The wounded knight wheezed something about getting to the Cloister through the sewers. He also mentioned that a zeugl guards the passage. I got a key from him. Time is running out, we must descend into the sewers. "Time is running out, we must descend into the sewers."
Triss claims a zeugl has made its lair in the sewers through which we must pass on our way to the Cloister. We'll have to defeat the creature. "I'll have to defeat the zeugl."
To the Cloister.
We defeated the zeugl! We must find a way out of the sewers and head for the Cloister. "We need to leave the sewers and head on to the Cloister."
The Believers.
We're near the Cloister, but we can expect a savage fight before we face the Grand Master. "We must break through to the Cloister gates."
The Cloister Gates.
The guards lie defeated. I'm almost there. "Time to enter the Cloister."
The Confrontation.
I'll go on alone. The hour of my confrontation with the Grand Master is near. I must prepare for that battle. "I must go on, find the Grand Master."
I'll go on alone. The hour of my confrontation with the Grand Master approaches. I must prepare for that battle. "I must move on, find the Grand Master."
I managed to convince Triss to walk away for a moment. I could not endanger her and must go on alone. The Grand Master awaits just past this threshold - and he will not go quietly. "I managed to send Triss away. I must enter the Cloister before she returns."
The Grand Master's Chambers.
The Grand Master's chambers are beyond this door. The guards possibly have keys. A fight to the death awaits just across this threshold. "I must prepare for a fight to the death."
Face to Face.
My meeting with the Grand Master did not go as I thought it would. A confrontation with Jacques de Aldersberg is imminent, the pursuit ends here. "I've forced the Grand Master into a confrontation which only one of us will survive."

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;
Daily Bread is a secondary quest given by Toruviel, leader of the Elves of Murky Waters, in Chapter IV.
Walkthrough.
Toruviel requests five loaves of Bread , which she believes will cost 20 , to feed herself and her compatriots.
It doesn't matter where the bread comes from in order to complete the quest, but If Geralt decides to buy the bread from an NPC (namely, the Baker), it will actually costs 25 , not 20 , so Geralt can choose to:
Notes.
If you have been diligent about keeping your shopping up to date, you will have this bread ready. Or if you never bothered to sell the assorted little loot and just dumped it at the innkeeper, knowing how to get rich in the game anyways and preparing for unexpected needs, Geralt could now open up his own bakery.
Otherwise, go see the baker in the village of Murky Waters and steal or buy some from him (there are four loaves of bread in his wardrobe to steal, so you may have to supplement that with what you find for free, or with a purchased loaf) or from other villagers.
Buns don't count as bread in the game. If you go with 4 bread and 1 bun to Toruviel you will lose 1000 XP for nothing.
Phases.
Bread.
Toruviel gave me 20 orens and asked me to buy five loaves of bread for the elves. I must find a baker or a merchant. "I must find a baker or a merchant." (20 )
If you buy four loaves: I could only get four loaves for twenty orens. Time to get back to the elves in the cave. "I should take the bread to Toruviel." (−20 ) or
If you buy five loaves: Twenty orens was enough to buy four loaves, but I bought a fifth one out of my own pocket. Anything for Toruviel... "I should take the bread to Toruviel." (−25 )
If you bought four loaves: Toruviel complained about human greed. Maybe she's right? Either way, those loaves won't save the elves from starving. "A few loaves of bread won't save the elves from starving." (7000 XP) or
If you bought five loaves: Toruviel was thankful for the bread, but what I bought can't save the elves, that's clear. "A few loaves of bread won't save the elves from starving." (8000 XP)

 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;Temptation is an optional quest in Chapter IV which forces the witcher to examine his own opinion on extra-marital affairs and the value of a promise.
Walkthrough.
As he is taking in the sights of the village of Murky Waters, Geralt is suddenly overcome by the powerful aroma of something good cooking and it seems to be emanating from the Blacksmith's house. It seems that the blacksmith recently killed a pig and his wife is now making a lovely stew with the meat. The witcher enters the house.
The blacksmith's wife is inside and greets him warmly. She notices that the witcher is rather thin and offers him some food which he gladly accepts. She then asks him if his services are available for hire, which of course they are.
It seems that her husband has taken up with a succubus and she can no longer tolerate the affair. She asks the witcher to collect nine portions of shimmering dust with which she plans to make an amulet which will ward off the succubus and put an end to the extra-marital activities. The witcher agrees and she offers him a herbarium as a reward.
He then leaves, intent on getting down to business when he is accosted by the blacksmith who has overheard the conversation. He makes a counter-proposal: the witcher should gather for him nine portions of shadow dust with which he could make a different potion which would merely put the succubus to sleep until the whole situation has blown over. Then the blacksmith could pick up where he left off with his "bit on the side" and his wife would be none the wiser. The blacksmith offers a choice of reward: a piece of red meteorite ore or 500 .
Geralt must choose with whom he wants to side. Should he keep the agreement he made with the wife, or switch his allegiance to her husband and help him?
Phases.
The Succubus.
The blacksmith's wife asked me to get rid of the succubus who haunts her husband. I need to kill nine noonwraiths in the field and collect shimmering dust from their hair. The smith's wife can use that dust. "I should venture out into the fields and return with nine handfuls of shimmering dust collected from the hair of noonwraiths."
Wife's path: I have the shimmering dust for the blacksmith's wife. I should get it to her, but I'm still considering her husband's offer... "I should take the dust to the blacksmith's wife."
Blacksmith's path: The blacksmith seems unhappy at the prospect of me banishing the succubus. He made me an offer. I need to collect nine handfuls of shadow dust from the corpses of several devourers. The blacksmith can use the dust to put the succubus to sleep for some time.
 Wife's path: I gave the dust to the blacksmith's wife as agreed. In exchange, she gave me a herbarium. "I have received my reward." ( + 8000 XP)
Blacksmith's path: I have the shadow dust for the blacksmith. I should deliver it, but I'm still considering his wife's offer...
Money: The blacksmith rewarded me for my services. I hope his wife never learns about our little deal... "I have received my reward." (500 + 8000 XP)
Meteorite: The blacksmith rewarded me for my services. I hope his wife never learns about our little deal... "I have received my reward." ( + 8000 XP)

The Vodyan Priest is one of nine optional trophy quests. This quest is obtained by killing Teyu, a vodyan cleric which Tobias Hoffman says is killing villagers in the fields. Only one trophy quest, The Beast of the Sewers, is not optional, making a total of ten.
Walkthrough.
Tobias Hoffman, the mayor of Murky Waters, tells you about the vodyan priest by the name of Teyu in the Fields. This quest is not to kill the "friendly" Vodyan priest, but another Dagon worshipping priest, Teyu, currently marauding in the fields near a small lake. He is usually accompanied by two warriors.
As a vodyan priest, he has the ability to heal himself and his entourage which adds a little complexity to the battle, but not too much! As usual the witcher prevails and can return the head of the "beast" for a healthy reward.
Phases.
The Vodyan Priest.
For some strange reason, the vodyan priest was attacking defenseless people and had to die. I should take proof of having killed him to the village chief and claim the reward. "I need to take the proof of having killed the vodyan priest to the village chief."
A Reward.
I gave the proof to the village chief and claimed the reward. "I received my reward for the trophy." (800 + 7000 XP)
Failed.
I doubt I'll ever see the village chief again, and I can bid that reward farewell. I lost my chance at that reward. I don't think I'll ever see the village chief again...

<doc id="2200" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2200" title="Elder Speech">
Elder Speech

Hen Llinge, or Elvish, is the language of the Aen Seidhe elves. As it is one of the oldest languages still in use, it is referred to as the Old or Elder Speech while the lingua franca is Common Speech. It is used not only by elves, but also by mages and scholars. Sung versions of Elder Speech are used by dryads, sirens, and nereids. Nilfgaardian, Skellige and Zerrikanian dialects all derive from Elder Speech.
Real world origins.
Its vocabulary is based heavily on the Celtic languages of Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, although in some cases Sapkowski has used also connotations with more "popular" languages, like German and English. The two basic verbs, "to be" and "to have", are borrowed from Italian and Latin.
The author invented the language for orcs and elves, but so far only the latter have appeared in the official continuity.
For the purpose of Netflix's "The Witcher", renowned linguist recreated the Elder Speech as a fully developed constructed language. In contrast with Sapkowski's writings, Peterson's latinization of the language reflects the intended pronunciation in the show, leaving the irregularities to the language's native script (which he had also invented). For example, "inváerne" is latinized as "inveirne" and "Hen Llinge" as "Hen Linge".
"Note: for the purposes of consistency with the Saga and the games, words coined for the TV series listed below follow the transliteration from Elder Runes rather than Peterson's romanization. For the latter, visit Hen Linge page on the linguist's wiki."

&lt;/infobox&gt;Working Girls is an optional quest in Chapter II which introduces the character of Carmen, the local madam.
Walkthrough.
As Geralt is strolling through the slums of the Temple Quarter, familiarizing himself with the area, he meets Carmen, the local madam, standing outside the Eager Thighs brothel across from The Hairy Bear. They indulge in a little witty repartee and then she mentions that her girls are being harassed by some men. Not the usual criminals who know to leave the hookers well enough alone, unless it is for business. These new guys are scarier. Naturally, the witcher offers to help and Carmen gratefully accepts, indicating on his map where he is likely to find these miscreants.
Later that night, just as he expected, our hero comes across two Salamanders who have cornered one of Carmen's girls. They seem intent on raping her when the witcher steps in. The girl runs to safety. The would-be assailants naturally underestimate Geralt and the ensuing fight ends as you would expect.
But this is too easy, there must be more. The witcher continues checking the locations on his map. Sure enough, he comes across a second and then a third scenario, exactly the same as the first, with similar results. That is more like it. Now the streets should be safer to walk at night. He heads back for his reward.
Phases.
Help for the "girls".
The bandits are harassing the girls working on the streets near "The Hairy Bear". Only a bastard wouldn't help a woman in need. I need to go to three of the most dangerous places at night and kick some bandits' asses. That should help. "I need to go to three of the most dangerous places and kick some bandit ass."
Fighting Bandits.
I taught a group of bandits a lesson. "Time to deal with the rest of the bandits." (200 XP)

Payment.
I taught three of the largest groups of bandits a lesson. The "girls" should be safe now. I need to see Carmen and get paid. "I need to see Carmen to get paid." (400 XP)
Cash reward: Carmen tried to lie her way out of rewarding me but she paid up in the end. I even got a discount with her girls... (200 + 1500 XP)
Non-monetary reward: I decided not to take money from Carmen. Her friends know how to show their gratitude. "Carmen's friends will show their gratitude...charging a symbolic flower." (1500 XP)

Carmen was the madame at the Eager Thighs brothel, located in the slums of the Temple Quarter, near The Hairy Bear. Her girls could be found plying their trade all around the Temple Quarter, and even on the dike. She, however, prefered to stay close to her base of operations, and so is usually found either directly outside the brothel, or just inside keeping the place tidy.
She had protection arrangements for her girls in place with the local underworld, but on occasion must've call upon extra help with some of the nastier elements of the trade. Since Salamandra had moved into town, no one was safe. In Working Girls, she asked the witcher to help three of her girls who were being menaced.
She was one possible choice of guest to invite to Shani's party, though probably not a welcome one. That was all right, as it turned out that she was in love with a werewolf anyway, but she would not reveal his identity, in case Geralt decided to kill him. This left the witcher no other choice than to find out for himself.
It was not Geralt's investigation however, that revealed the werewolf's identity. A chance encounter in the restricted part of the Trade Quarter lead to the surprising discovery that Carmen's lover was none other than Vincent, captain of the City Guard. Once she realized that Geralt knew that Vincent was the werewolf, she begged him to help find a cure.
She also enjoyed a good round of dice and was a herself.
"I met Carmen, a prostitute from Vizima's slums. All the local strumpets value her opinion, and it could be said that Carmen is their representative."
only if Geralt invites Carmen to Shani's party:
"I invited Carmen to Shani's party. She turned out to be quite entertaining, as I expected she would be."
only if Geralt cures Vincent:
"I freed Vincent from the lycanthropy curse and managed to convince him that Carmen is worthy of his love. I hope things work out for them."
only if Geralt kills the werewolf:
"I met Carmen in a strange house in the rebellion-ravaged Temple Quarter."

&lt;/infobox&gt;The list of misfortunes that can befall the inhabitants of a village includes plague, war, and taxes. The worst misfortune, however, entails the appearance of a ghostly hellhound known simply as "The Beast". Many bad things can be said about this creature, but they all come down to two things: blood and pain.
 Received by reading Berengar's notes on the Beast.
 "The hellhound, referred to also as the Beast, is a creature of the underworld, a specter that assumes the form of a terrifying hound and tirelessly stalks its victims once it finds their trail. Peasants believe that the hellhound embodies the vengeance of the gods, who send the Beast to punish humans for their wickedness."
Combat tactics.
Killing the Hellhound with one easy blow (Aard skill does not have to be upgraded to include Stun):
The game jumps to midnight so you need to get into the cutscene past the cave at 22:00-23:00 so that your magic is still working at that point. To do so take following steps:

Fight while wasted.

Adam was the local poet in Murky Waters, his skills in that area were suspect at best. He was also not so secretly in love with Alina, was considered a fool by Alina's father Tobias Hoffman, and the rest of the village did not seem to have too high an opinion of him either. His occupation, other than aspiring poet, was unknown.
"Adam is one of Murky Waters' more interesting residents. He's desperately and hopelessly in love with Alina, but that hasn't helped his poetry a bit."
If Geralt exposes Adam:
"Adam, a young poet in love with Alina, accused of killing Celina. He has been arrested and awaits trial."
Poetry.
Although his true love was ripped from this life by her jealous sister, Adam still clung to the dream of being eternally with Alina. It was during the first lonely days in a rat infested cell that Adam finally found his muse, and penned a poem for Alina.
Alina
"I loved you like the noon day sun,that played across the fields of gold.O Alina, my heart did yearn for one,but t'was fear kept my words not as bold."
"Now the sun is naught a sight for me,as a dark bitterness roots deep in my soul.How I yearn once more your face to see,but this reeking cell is home til I pay my toll."
The example above is his finest work, ever, really. In a few conversations, we really get to plumb the depths of his oeuvre. It is bad enough that, at one point, Geralt asks him to simply stop speaking. Here is the poem which prompts the outburst:
Untitled
"Your hands fine and slender,""your hips big and tender,""all night and all day,""spin my head a painful way..."
It might go on, but the witcher just stops him there.

Alina was a young girl from Murky Waters and the daughter of the village chief, Tobias Hoffman. She was to be married to Julian, a rich merchant from Kovir, much to the disgust of her jealous sister Celina and the poet Adam, who was secretly in love with her.
She can initially be found in her house in the village of Murky Waters. Later, once she becomes a noonwraith, she usually hangs out near the ruin mill in the Fields.
She seemed strangely resigned to marrying Julian and appeared fond of him, at least in a way, but she also showed no intention whatsoever of ending her affair with Adam which she carried on every day at noon, in the raspberry patch in the fields. She did seem jealous of Celina's attempts to gain Julian's attention, even though this last endeavor was proving fruitless.
She had also developed quite an attachment to Alvin. She would have dearly loved to have adopted him and raise him with Julian, but Julian was not so taken with the prospect of raising a child who was, from all reports, a source.
The jealous rivalry with her sister reached a peak one day when Celina started to argue with her, near the Raspberry patch, and ended up pushing Alina down and causing Alina to hit her head on a rock, killing her instantly. Because she was murdered in this manner, Alina arised as a noonwraith, doomed to forever roam the fields.
"A young girl from Murky Waters. Soon she will marry Julian, against the will of her jealous sister Celina and the poet Adam, who loves her."

Alvin was a boy who managed to escape the barghest attack which cost his foster mother her life. As a result of the shock, he started to divine the future and uttered the Prophecy of Ithlinne. It is supposed that Alvin was a Source, having magical powers he couldn't control.
Alvin lived with Abigail until the Reverend snatched him while collecting water for Abigail. The preacher gave the orphan to a group of Salamandra lackeys, who demanded that the dwellers of the Outskirts surrender their children.
In Chapter III, Geralt finds Alvin a second time. This time the boy is being held at St. Lebioda's Hospital, until he is kidnapped by Salamandra once again. In Chapter IV, Geralt finds the boy a third time, in the village of Murky Waters.
"A boy named Alvin managed to escape the barghest attack which cost his foster mother her life. As a result of the shock, he started to divine the future and uttered the Prophecy of Ithlinne. I suppose Alvin is a Source - he has magical powers he cannot control."
"Alvin lived with Abigail until the witch gave the boy to the Reverend. The preacher gave the orphan to a group of Salamandra thugs, who demanded that the dwellers of the Outskirts surrender their children. I killed the bandits and saved Alvin."
If Geralt leaves Alvin with Triss:
"I met Alvin again, this time in Old Vizima. Both Triss and Shani wanted to take care of the boy. After some consideration I left him with Triss."
If Geralt leaves Alvin with Shani:
"I met Alvin again, this time in Old Vizima. Both Triss and Shani wanted to take care of the boy. After some consideration I left him with Shani."
"Alvin disappeared and was found in the village of Murky Waters, where a young couple took him in. Wild magical skills still dwell in him, but the amulet I gave him from Triss should suppress them."
"The boy seems to have taken to me. When I was in Murky Waters he followed me everywhere and asked a multitude of questions. My answers impressed him. I think Alvin can travel through time and space, though he cannot control these abilities and they surface when he is under stress."
"When the Order's units appeared in Murky Waters, Alvin was taken hostage by the elves. The boy got so scared during the ensuing fight that he used his extraordinary skills to disappear. I still hope to meet him again."
Speculation about Alvin.
Many fans of the game believe that Alvin is actually the Grandmaster, Jacques de Aldersberg. When the fight between the elves under Toruviel and the Order of the Flaming Rose erupts in full force in the village of Murky Waters, Alvin teleports himself away because he is frightened by an elven warrior. Alvin's ability to teleport himself through time and space stems from the fact that he is a source. It is widely theorized that he flees to the past, perhaps back to where he was raised, and ultimately incorporates what he had learned with Geralt, accepting his perceived fate and becoming the Grand Master.
Clues that speak to this hypothesis include the dimeritium pendant Alvin wears. Alvin, the boy has one as does the Grand Master; only difference is that Aldersberg's amulet shows years of wear. But the previous hint, that he went back to time with everything, clothes, knowledge etc. explains it. Another hint lies in the mention that Alvin's favorite game is "kill the elf" where he "always" plays the Grand Master and wins. Also, when Jacques' group comes to the aid of the refugees in the Swamp Cemetery (Chapter V), Jacques tells Geralt that he was returning a favour by saving the witcher's life, possibly referring to Geralt rescuing Alvin from kidnappers in Chapters I and III, killing the Devourer who attacks Alvin in Chapter IV or slaughtering the barghests hunting Alvin at the beginning of Chapter I. In the same conversation, Jacques is suspiciously quick to accuse Geralt of preachiness; not a common trait of Geralt's, but one he must show when acting as a father-figure to Alvin. Jacques also mentions that he knows about Geralt from "a source", which could be wordplay hinting at his past. In addition some of Jacques conversation in Ice Plains reflects the choices you tell Alvin in the Murky Waters area (for example that "a person's gift should be used for good of others", to which the Grand Master repeats the same comment in first person and says he was told that many times by the Witcher), it would be impossible for the Grand Master to know that conversation unless he was Alvin (or somehow met Alvin after the events of Murky Waters). Furthermore, if you chose to send him with Triss, instead of saying he taught himself to use the power she will instead say "he uses magic wildly, like someone who began magic lessons but never finished them." which implies that your choices with Alvin affect Jacques.
Some feel that a counter-argument to this hypothesis is that townspeople in Chapters II and III already speak of Jacques de Aldersberg despite the fact that Alvin is in the care of Geralt and either Triss or Shani at that time and place, suggesting that they are two different people. Others feel that the two co-existing does not violate any time-travelling principles. One possible inconsistency is that Alvin has blonde hair and Jacques de Aldersberg has brown hair. However, children born with blonde hair in real life often darken to a middle brown as they grow up, so this difference in hair color is not prohibitive.
In the scene where Alvin tells Geralt that he wants to be a witcher, the player can answer "Don't become a witcher, become a knight" to which Alvin replies "I will be a Witcher-Knight!" suggesting a knight who hunts monsters, as the Order of the Flaming Rose does. Furthermore, during a dialogue with Siegfried, Geralt learns that even a witcher "can" become a member of the Order.
In the Fields in Chapter IV, the player must choose a piece of advice to give to Alvin. Whichever advice you choose, it will be parroted back to Geralt by Jacques in the Epilogue, which is highly suggestive. The Quests section of the Journal even notes the correlation: "The Grand Master's words seem familiar, though I'm not sure to what..." For more information on this correlation, see below.
After defeating Azar Javed, Geralt has the option to ask Triss about Jacques. She tells him that he never had any education of sorcery and learned to use the Power by himself. It is very unlikely that Alvin was adopted by someone with knowledge as Triss' after going back in time, so if he learned to use the Power, it can be assumed it was self-taught.
At the end of the game, if the King of the Wild Hunt is allowed to take Jacques de Aldersberg's soul, he tells Geralt that he knew this soul under another name as well, possibly pointing to Alvin, although his name is not explicitly uttered. Also, all of the lessons given to Alvin by Geralt appear to have had a major influence on the Aldersberg's expressed views during the endgame speeches.
Alvin appears in the Icy Wasteland in the Epilogue. Perhaps he is summoned by Geralt, perhaps by Jacques, he quickly disappears without a chance to begin a dialogue with him Meeting Dandelion after the final confrontation, Geralt brings this question up himself. The two conclude that they will never know for sure.
The following is from the official game guide released by CDProjekt: "The mist is no more and you appear back in the courtyard. Fights are ending and the political situation is stabilizing. Search the body of Jacques de Aldersberg, powerful and insane man, who he was a short while ago. Now he is no more, he doesn't exist - he is dead. Take the last part of the Witchers' secrets and the strange amulet, very similar to the one you gave to Alvin in Murky Waters. Where did Alvin go? What happened to the poor boy?"
The game guide also describes what the Grand Master will say depending on what Geralt said to Alvin on the topics of destiny, other races and witchers. These fan speculations have neither been confirmed nor denied by the developers.
Correlated conversations.
As noted above, the player's choice of advice to give to Alvin in Chapter IV determines the content of a specific conversation with Jacques de Aldersberg in the Epilogue (the one following the confrontation with Abigail's shade), suggesting that Jacques is Alvin. Alvin asks Geralt what he should do about his visions of people dying; Jacques tells Geralt that his Grand Plan (created in response to "his" visions of people dying) was in keeping with Geralt's earlier advice to Alvin.
Alvin asks, "I want them to like me. I don't want them to die. What should I do?"
"If Geralt tells Alvin," "Your visions are a gift, not a curse. It's up to you to use them for good," "then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:"
Jacques: Only a grand plan pursued without hesitation could save humanity from what I saw in my visions.
Geralt: You trust your daydreams that much?
Jacques: I never asked for these visions, this gift.
Geralt: But you chose how to use it.
Jacques: Many times you insisted special gifts should be used for just causes. I chose the most just of causes - saving millions of lives.
Geralt: And pursued it by ending hundreds of others. How many more do you aim to condemn?
Jacques: You have no notion of the approaching cataclysm. The spirits of those who perished wander here. Tell them they had no right to survive.
"If Geralt tells Alvin," "Destiny isn't everything. We are masters of our own fate,"" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:"
Jacques: Only a grand plan pursued without hesitation could save humanity from what I saw in my visions.
Geralt: You trust your daydreams that much?
Jacques: Many of the gifted foresaw the White Frost. Global cooling is this world's destiny.
Geralt: Why fight it then?
Jacques: You always believed man makes his own destiny. I seek to change all humanity's fate.
Geralt: You robbed humanity of its right to decide. You understand nothing.
Jacques: Geralt, I hear the walls of those who perished. Hear their cries and you will know my pain
"If Geralt tells Alvin, "Keep your gift a secret. The lives of the gifted are rarely easy," then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:"
Jacques: Only a grand plan pursued without hesitation could save humanity from what I saw in my visions.
Geralt: You trust your daydreams that much?
Jacques: You think this burden easy to bear? Like you, I tried to hide my otherness. To use my powers to redeem my sin.
Geralt: What sin?
Jacques: The worst of all. My otherness. So I acted for the common good.
Geralt: The good of the few you hand-picked to survive.
Jacques: No, the good of all who would die. The dead wander here still. Tell them to their faces they did not deserve to live.
During the conversation about Berengar, Alvin says, "Witchers are brave. They never go ill."
"If Geralt tells Alvin," "Wouldn't you rather be a knight?" "then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:"
Jacques: How stubborn you are. I could use you to shepherd my sheep during the first years of winter.
Geralt: I doubt you mean it. You stole our secrets from Kaer Morhen – used them for the worst ends!
Jacques: Your guild's tenets proved a failure. Too much individualism.
Jacques: I needed holy knight as able as witchers, evoking an image of nobility, not a hand stretched out for coin.
Geralt: Bullshit, you wanted power.
Jacques: If you say so. When my troops arrive, ask what they think of me as their master.
"If Geralt tells Alvin," "We never get sick, but that costs us. And then there's pain... Would you like to hurt badly?" "then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:"
Jacques: How stubborn you are. I could use you to shepherd my sheep during the first years of winter.
Geralt: I doubt you mean it. You stole our secrets from Kaer Morhen – used them for the worst ends!
Jacques: Witchers were meant to be guardians but proved too weak. You loathe yourselves.
Jacques: I needed witchers, but perfect ones – emotionless, lacking human weaknessses.
Geralt: You see human traits as weaknesses? I pity you.
Jacques: Fear obscures your thinking. My knights never hesitate.
"If Geralt tells Alvin," "It's not true that witchers are never afraid. Besides, none remain who can complete the mutation..." "then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:"
Jacques: How stubborn you are. I could use you to shepherd my sheep during the first years of winter.
Geralt: I doubt you mean it. You stole our secrets from Kaer Morhen – used them for the worst ends!
Jacques: I needed witchers but knew the secrets of mutation had been lost.
Jacques: You witchers had it all, but lacked courage and vision. I merely did what you desired in your hearts.
Geralt: You took them, as if they were your own. You're a thief, a hypocrite.
Jacques: Are you incapable of seeing the golden path of my dreams? My knights will explain to you in a way you will understand.
Lastly, Alvin asks, "Geralt, why are the elves doing this?"
"If Geralt tells Alvin," "The elves refuse to concede that the world has changed. They cannot win but still they fight. It's their sad, desperate attempt at halting evolution." "then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:"
Jacques: Of course, I had to get rid of any standing in the way. Especially nonhumans.
Geralt: Why so obsessed about other races?
Jacques: Geralt, they are condemned to perish. I gave them a chance to die in battle.
Geralt: Humanity's also a passing phase. But unlike elves, we won't leave much behind.
Jacques: We won't disappear, not with the guardians I created. You'll see soon enough how well they manage in these conditions.
"If Geralt tells Alvin," "They're fighting for their freedom, for an ideal. Humans have them up against a wall and they see no other way..." "then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:"
Jacques: Of course, I had to get rid of any standing in the way. Especially nonhumans.
Geralt: Why so obsessed about other races?
Jacques: I was prepared to sacrifice anything, to save humanity at all costs. Do you know the saying, "The ends justify the means?"
Geralt: I do. You sound pathetic, De Aldersberg, as if you believed your own lies.
Jacques: Nonhumans, their extinction, is not a goal but a means. Since you detest humans so, I'll leave you with my no longer human serfs. You have much in common, you should get along.
"If Geralt tells Alvin," "They've lost their lofty, beautiful veneer. One can clearly see the deep hatred they hold for humans." "then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:"
Jacques: Of course, I had to get rid of any standing in the way. Especially nonhumans.
Geralt: Why so obsessed about other races?
Jacques: You're joking. They detest humans.
Jacques: With the slaughter in Vizima, they discarded their noble masks. How can you stand with murderers of women and children?
Geralt: Another lie. You provoked the nonhumans!
Jacques: Hatred for hatred. I'll show you my creations. Honest, they don't hide their intentions behind beautiful faces.
It is potentially 'telling' that a private conversation between Geralt and Alvin can influence Jacques' statements in this way. However, the argument that Jacques and Alvin share a core identity is made rather circular by the notion that the Ice Wastes are populated with manifestations of memories and thoughts, recalling the trope of 'conversations with oneself', wherein one does not know whether to trust a vision that may come entirely from one's subconscious. (Jacques has extraordinary raw power that could simply be used to craft convincing dialogue based on what he can detect of the effectively 'captive', at least while 'within' the Wastes, Geralt's memories and personal connections.)
Confirmation.
After a long time the theory of Alvin being Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg was confirmed in the final part of Geralt's trilogy: "". In the secondary quest: "Message from an Old Friend" bookseller Marcus Thaddeus Knut Hodgson tells the witcher about a message that someone left him a long time ago. This letter is named "Letter from "A" "and is placed inside the book titled "My Manifesto - The Life of Jacques de Aldersberg."

Cloister

The Cloister is where the Order of the Flaming Rose makes its headquarters in the city of Vizima. It remains locked and inaccessible for most of the game. We only begin to see activity outside its main doors during Chapter III and Geralt is only finally able to enter it during the Epilogue.
"There is really only one haven of law and order in the Temple Quarter of Vizima. It is the Cloister — the seat of the Order of the Flaming Rose. Crimson banners embroidered with a rose hang before the entrance. Only authorized personnel can enter. Inquiries should be directed to Siegfried, whose office is in one of the buildings belonging to the Order."

St. Lebioda's Hospital

Saint Lebioda's hospital is one of the most prominent buildings in the Temple Quarter. It is bound to the north by Peddler Street, to the east, by Hospital Street and to the west by Heroes of the Guard Street. The grounds boast a lovely garden tended by the gardener, a former mercenary. It is also Shani's place of work.
Access.
If the guard at the entrance won't let you in the hospital, he will let you in with a bribe. He may accept a lower amount, but 50 is a safe number. Alternatively, after much hassle it is possible to prove Vincent Meis' innocence as a part of prior to entering the hospital, to get City Guard signet ring from him. With it, the guard won't bother Geralt. This "bribeless" way is much more plot choice dependent and is not a foolproof mean of entering the hospital, leaving bribery as the only viable option.
"The hospital, named after the prophet Lebioda, was set up in a former temple of Melitele. To this day a triple-bodied statue of the goddess stands inside. Nurses and novices work there, trying to help those struck by the plague. It is not a pleasant place, filled with the moans of the suffering and the stench of their excretions. Those who do not survive the disease, meaning the overwhelming majority, are thrown into a pit behind the hospital. Every once in a while, the bodies are burned to prevent the plague from spreading. Recently the Order of the Flaming Rose placed the hospital under its protection."

Lakeside

The lakeside is where Geralt unexpectedly finds himself after his near fatal encounter with Princess Adda at the end of Chapter III. Luckily for the witcher, Triss managed to transport him some distance from Vizima and away from danger in the nick of time.
After his abrupt landing, he witnesses the locals watching a rather spectacular mirage rising above the lake and is greeted by a rather curious and chatty young girl, who fills him on on all the recent goings-on. Also in the vicinity is a naiad, a servant of the Lady of the Lake swimming in the shallows, and a friendly vodyanoi priest worshipping at the Lady's altar.
 "In the evenings, a light breeze from the lake ripples the waters of small inlets, the Fisher King gathers his nets, and the few villagers come to watch the mirage of the underwater city, seen above the lake's surface thanks to the unusually clear waters, the light of the moon and a little optical magic. There is also a cave in the area, a refuge for elven fugitives who live in peace alongside the inhabitants of the nearby village."

Blue-eyed lass was the unnamed sister of an Order of the Flaming Rose knight going by the name of Patrick de Weyze, and one of the beauties working at the House of the Queen of the Night, the finest bordello in Vizima that served the rich and powerful.
Ironically, her eyes were actually green. She loved sapphires, in any form, as they supposedly brought out the beauty of her eyes. She also had a mysterious scar on her neck, left by a vampire.
Biography.
She ran away from home to get away from her controlling brother but he wanted her to come back and marry the man he chose for her. She, however, had absolutely no intention of going back as she loved her life at the House of the Night.
"The blue-eyed beauty from the House of the Night has an interesting scar on her neck. Looks just like a vampire bite..."

Outskirts Inn

Known simply as the Inn, it is the first building Geralt finds upon reaching the Outskirts. It is surrounded by a palisade which also shelters a blacksmith, mercenaries and some stranded travellers, merchants among them.
There are two gates in the palisade. One leads to the Outskirts and the other presumably leads back towards Kaedwen, from whence Geralt arrived. The latter is locked by the mercenaries guarding it, and remains so for the duration of Chapter I.
"The inn in the Outskirts was established to cater to the needs of travelers and merchants headed for Vizima. The owner has surrounded it with a high palisade. Although the inn doesn't feature extravagant comforts, it is a safe place to spend the night and eat a meal. The innkeeper also offers a wide selection of alcohol. It is a favorite meeting place for the inhabitants of the Outskirts, so there's always someone to talk to or dice with."
Characters and Amenities.
Inside.
Alvin, Dandelion, Declan Leuvaarden, Kalkstein, Shani and Zoltan Chivay can also be found here at various times during Chapter I.

Crypt in the outskirts

The crypt in the Outskirts is located to the northeast of the village area, at the end of a path. Inside, it boasts a circle of elements, the Circle of Inner Fire and a Place of Power.
Initially, the crypt seems to have only two chambers and a rotunda, but later in Chapter I, after Mikul's fellow guards have picked through the additional walls to get at the much anticipated riches inside, four more chambers open up. The farthest of these contains a rather nasty alghoul, Ozzrel and some additional valuable loot.
"There is an old crypt in the Outskirts, and it has not been used for a long time. People are afraid to enter it because of the monsters that dwell there."
"Rumor has it that treasure is hidden inside the crypt. The truth is that people of old were buried there with valuable items; sometimes the graves of the wealthy were separated from the remainder of the crypt by an additional wall for fear of robbery."

A Most Uncommon Wine is an optional quest given to Geralt by Conrad, a young man the witcher meets at The Hairy Bear in Chapter II.
Walkthrough.
"Very old wine. This wine has matured for a very long time and connoisseurs will certainly find it enjoyable."
Conrad can be found drinking the night away at The Hairy Bear in Vizima. He complains about the quality of the inn's wine, says he knows of a much higher quality vintage, and suggests that Geralt retrieve some. He gives our hero the location of the "well-stocked cellar" which is then marked on Geralt's map.
 Note: The "directions" put in the quest log aren't very useful; just check the map and head for the red "Well-Stocked Cellar" marker.
Geralt then goes to the house, kills the monsters, grabs the wine from the barrels and returns to The Hairy Bear and speak with Conrad (he enters at 18:00) and collect his reward. But it is not that easy, Conrad tells him that he has no money, so he can not pay for the witcher's efforts but he offers a deal: he will take only one bottle of wine, and Geralt can keep the rest. The wine is quite valuable, so this is a good deal, and accepting it is not a bad idea, but Geralt "can" get an extra 80 for that one bottle.
This concludes the quest. Conrad will stay at The Hairy Bear permanently, it seems.
Phases.
Good Wine.
An eccentric young man asked me to obtain a very rare wine for him. I am to go to a house with a most well-stocked cellar. The only hitch about this is the fact that this cellar is said to be occupied by monsters. "I am to bring wine from a house with a well-stocked cellar."
The Location.
The house with the wine cellar is on the canal. I need to go through the gate leading to the Dike, to the house at the first junction. "I need to go to the house at the first junction past the gate leading to the Dike."
To the Inn.
I guess this is the wine Conrad was looking for. I must go to the inn in the evening and give it to him. "I must go to the inn in the evening and give the wine to Conrad." (500 XP)
Quest Complete.
I completed Conrad's quest and although he had no money for me, I don't feel like I lost out on this deal. "Conrad and I are even on this one." (1500 XP)

&lt;/infobox&gt;
A Gravedigger's Gratitude is an entirely optional sub-quest of Vizima Confidential. It is not strictly necessary to the completion of the investigation as a whole, despite being one of the most influential.
Walkthrough.
Outside the cemetery's main gates in the Temple Quarter, Geralt encountered the lone Gravedigger hammering nails into freshly built coffins. With the Salamandra investigation ongoing, it certainly could be worthwhile to inquire into trails and leads hidden in the place where the dead rest.
Yet the gravedigger refuses to grant the witcher access, claiming that he could only do so when presented with official pass issued by the City Guard captain, Vincent Meis. Or, one could still earn his gratitude if said person offered to buy out the gravedigger's debt owned by Thaler.
The witcher then sets off asking for help from the two. But obviously, things are never so easy: Neither of them are willing to help unless Geralt clears them of suspicion of working with Salamandra first.
Having done that, Geralt finally received the key to the cemetery from the gravedigger. However, things took a completely unexpected turn when the witcher found something of extreme importance in the cemetery crypt: the detective Raymond's body. And there is only one man with both the means and the will to assume his identity: Azar Javed.""
With the finding of this shocking "Grand Truth", the quest comes to an end when Geralt returned the cemetery key to the gravedigger.
Phases.
The Permit.
The gravedigger says the cemetery should be full of clues. I just need a permit to enter. I should ask someone who has contacts among the city guards or... I could just buy out the gravedigger's debts from Thaler... "I need a permit to enter the cemetery. Thaler or the city guards should provide me with one."
Talk to Thaler: If I mention Thaler, the gravedigger will let me in. "I may go to the gravedigger now."
or
Talk to Vincent: I received a pass to enter the cemetery from Vincent. "I may go to the gravedigger now."
Talk to Thaler: The gravedigger was grateful that I bought out his debts from Thaler and allowed me to enter the cemetery. I should take a look around the crypt. "I should take a look around the crypt in the cemetery."
or
Talk to Vincent: The gravedigger saw my pass and allowed me to enter the cemetery. I should take a look around the crypt." I should take a look around the crypt in the cemetery."
The Cemetery is Open.
The cemetery gate is open. I sense trouble. "I can enter the cemetery now."
The Discovery.
I found Raymond's body. Azar must have killed and impersonated him. How could I have fallen for this illusion! [] I have to tell the gravedigger about this - after all it's his cemetery. I also should return his key. "I have to tell the gravedigger about my discovery and return his key." (500 XP)
Raymond's Body.
I found the body of the real Raymond at the cemetery. Fighting my way through the ghouls was worth it. "I found the body of the real Raymond at the cemetery." (1000 XP)

<doc id="2241" url="http://witcher.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2241" title="The Witcher alchemy">
The Witcher alchemy

The art of alchemy is widely used in "The Witcher", not just by Geralt, but by other characters as well.
Formulae.
"For the main article, see :Formulae."
All alchemical creations are based on formulae. These recipes are generally found in the form of scrolls, but some are acquired through word of mouth. Scrolls can be purchased, found or acquired as rewards for services rendered.
Experimentation.
As mentioned by Kalkstein, when asking him about alchemy, formulae can be obtained by experimenting. This method requires manually mixing ingredients along with an appropriate base in an attempt to create a new potion, oil or bomb. The result will always be an unknown potion, oil or bomb and must first be tested in order to see if the experiment works. If your ingredient combination was correct the formuae will be added to your journal and can now be used just like any other unlocked recipe. If it doesn't work then the experiment will likely hurt Geralt, or in the case of oils his sword.
When experimenting to find formulae there are 56 possible combinations for 3 ingredient bases, 126 for 4 ingredient bases, and 252 for 5 ingredient bases. This is a total of 434 possible combinations for each type, a grand total of 1302 combinations. Keep this in mind when you wish to experiment in finding formulae when experimenting.
It is possible to tell if an experiment is a failure or a success based on their inventory icon as failed experiments always have the same icon while all success' have individual icons. For example if you mix while using a potion base it will unlock the recipe for White Honey or Specter Oil if you use a blade coating base instead.
A clear benefit of using this method is that any recipe can be obtained at any time. This also includes mutagenic potions like Werewolf's Wrath, however, since those require unique ingredients you only have 1 attempt at getting the recipe correct, also you will usually obtain the appropriate recipe prior to obtaining the unique ingredient.
Ingredients.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher ingredients."
Mixtures (potions, oils and bombs) are created by combining selected ingredients, which include herbs, monster parts and minerals, with a medium, referred to as a base. The base determines the type of mixture to be created. Alcohol is the base for potions, grease is used for oils, and black powder serves as the base for making bombs.
Basic substances.
Alchemical ingredients all contain one of the six substances shown below. Just click on the icon for a more complete description of each substance:
Mixture formulae list the proportions of substances that need to be mixed rather than ingredient amounts. For instance, White Gull () is obtained by mixing two measures of vitriol and a measure of rebis with concentrated alcohol.
Substances are present in various ingredients, consequently various combinations of the latter may be used as long as they contain the required substances. For example, vitriol is found in both sewant mushrooms and in ghoul blood, so either of these ingredients may be used to create White Gull.
Additional substances.
There are three additional (or secondary) substances: albedo, nigredo and rubedo. A given ingredient may contain only one of these substances, or may contain none. If all ingredients selected to create a potion (and only a potion) contain the same additional substance, the resulting potion will provide the following additional benefits:
Example: The Bindweed potion requires 1 aether, 1 quebrith, and 1 vermilion ingredient. If mixing an aether ingredient containing albedo with quebrith and vermilion ingredients which contain rubedo, a standard Bindweed potion will result because all of the ingredients don't contain the same additional substance. However, if mixing an aether ingredient containing rubedo with a quebrith ingredient containing rubedo and a vermilion ingredient containing rubedo, the result will be a Bindweed potion with the dominant substance rubedo.
Another thing to bear in mind is that White Gull can also be mixed to contain a dominant substance as well as being used as a potion base. If it has a dominant substance and is used to create another potion, the rest of the ingredients need to contain the same secondary substance as the White Gull or a normal potion will result. If it contains no dominant substance while the rest of ingredients all contain, say, rubedo, then a potion containing rubedo will result.
Also, potions with a dominant secondary substance will stack separately from "regular" potions in Geralt's inventory.
Special ingredients.
 Items which can be obtained by slaying unique monsters, and occasionally, from plants. These can be used to create unique potions with powerful effects (often granting additional talents to be used to obtain skills, or granting special skills directly).
Creating Mixtures.
To create a mixture, make sure you have the required ingredients first, then find a place to rest and, while meditating, choose the Alchemy icon. The Alchemy panel includes a mixture brewing window and provides access to previously gathered ingredients.
Mechanics.
Known formulae appear on the left side of the Alchemy panel. A formula is available or "activated" when Geralt possesses all required ingredients and a base of appropriate potency. Clicking on a formula in the list will transfer the necessary ingredients and base to the mixing slots, but possibly not the exact ingredients you want. Any suboptimal choice of ingredient can be replaced by dragging the preferred item and dropping it onto the one to be replaced.
Mixture categories:
Mixtures are most often created based on formulae which list substances that must be mixed with a base. Substances are found in ingredients that include , minerals, and monster parts. A given substance, for instance vitriol, might be found in several different ingredients, meaning that potions based on vitriol can be composed in many different ways. Any formula the witcher learns (reads, hears about) is automatically added to the Alchemy section of the Journal.
Mixtures can be created without a formula by trial and error. Each such attempt results in the creation of an unknown mixture, the use of which is potentially hazardous, for unlucky mixtures can be harmful, possibly even fatal. However, if the ingredients are matched correctly, Geralt automatically receives the formula for the mixture he has discovered.
Potions.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher potions."
The transformations witchers undergo as children enable their mutated bodies to use magic potions that would be deadly to an ordinary person. These potions increase witchers' fighting abilities, render them immune to venoms, enable them to see in the dark. Witchers usually drink magic decoctions in preparation for a fight, but do so less frequently in combat due to lack of time.
Mechanics:
Witchers' potions are toxic and slowly poison Geralt, though one of his special abilities is a tolerance for toxins, represented by the green status bar (below the Endurance and Vitality bars) in the game screen. Each potion consumed increases the body's level of Toxicity, the green status bar. If this passes a certain point, Geralt becomes dizzy and loses Vitality. If his tolerance level is exceeded, Geralt first loses consciousness, then dies.
Meditation rids the body of poisons rapidly. If they expire, current potion effects will be canceled during time spent meditating.
Oils.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher oils."
From studying the weaknesses of various monster species, the witchers gained knowledge that allowed them to develop deadly blade coatings. These coatings, referred to as oils, employ simple magic and are adapted to take advantage of vulnerabilities in each beast's physiology.
For example, knowing that he may face a ghoul, the witcher prepares Necrophage Oil and coats his weapon with it before the battle. The oil will also be effective against other necrophages like graveirs.
Information on monsters' weaknesses, including their susceptibility to blade coatings, can be found in books that record the experiences of generations of witchers. When the witcher reads a book of this kind, the knowledge he acquires about a given beast appears in his Journal.
Note that oils can only be created if Talent points have been invested in the Oil Preparation skill.
Oils are created much like other mixtures, the ingredients are mixed with a base, which in this case is grease.
Blades can be coated with oils from the Inventory at any time, but it does take time to do this, so the middle of a battle is not considered a "good" time.
Mechanics:
Bombs.
"For the main article, see :The Witcher bombs."
The formulae for explosives or bombs were brought by merchants from faraway Zerrikania. These devices are rare. Traditional witcher training does not include any schooling in bomb use, but thanks to their basic alchemy abilities, witchers are capable of making and using explosives.
Note that bombs can only be created if Talent points have been invested in the Bomb Preparation skill, which in turn requires the Oil Preparation skill.
Bombs are made much like other mixtures. Their ingredients are mixed with a base, namely black powder.
Mechanics:

&lt;/infobox&gt;A Pilgrimage is an optional quest in Chapter II which Geralt can undertake after meeting Gramps near the landing in the swamp.
Walkthrough.
Gramps, a man that seems as old and lonely as the swamp itself, waits helplessly along the rocky road near the docks. He awaits the muscle of some kind stranger, so to speak, to offer him their assistance. No good deed goes unpunished.
Phases.
Escort.
The old man that wants people to call him Gramps asked me to escort him to the Melitele shrine in the swamps. I must follow him and make sure nothing happens to him. "I must escort Gramps to the Melitele shrine." (200 XP)
The Vodyanoi Cult.
Gramps told me about a strange cult of the brickmakers. They worship creatures called the vodyanoi and they communicate with them through items the leave on the altar. I must follow Gramps all the way to the Melitele shrine. "I must escort Gramps to the Melitele shrine." (200 XP, location: Clay Pits)
The Tomb.
Gramps told me that wild dogs turned the cave into their den. Despite that, it may prove to be an interesting place as somewhere in the dark here is a tomb with a vran treasure. Gramps set off to continue his journey. I must follow him. "I must escort Gramps to the Melitele shrine." (200 XP, location: Cave)
The Tower.
Walking past an old tower, Gramps told me gossip about it. Since its owner's death, no one has managed to get inside. In order to do it, one has to place special runes on appropriate pedestals. Gramps vigorously got back to his journey. I must guard him.
"I must escort Gramps to the Melitele shrine." (200 XP + Mage's tower journal entry, location: Mage's Tower)
Celandine.
Gramps told me how to use the [] celandine. I memorized his lecture and I will try to make potions using this plant. I hope the chapel is not far away. "I must escort Gramps to the Melitele shrine." (200 XP + formulae for Maribor Forest and King and Queen, location: Three Islands, northwest of the Clay Pits)
The Shrine.
I escorted Gramps to the Melitele shrine. Let the good old man pray in peace.
"I took Gramps safely to the Melitele shrine."
Berengar.
As I was leaving Gramps, he told me that he had met Berengar. The witcher was interested in the druids' Elemental Circle and the tower ruins. The druids should know more about this. Gramps invited me to his house as well. Perhaps I should accept his offer one day? "Gramps asked me to pay him a visit." (1500 XP)

Walkthrough.
Geralt acquires this quest by slicing and dicing this overgrown asparagus in his travels through the Swamp. After slaying the Beast of the Sewers, he consults Vincent Meis for a list of other monsters which fetch a good price, and this plant is at the top of the captain's list.
After the witcher has slain the plant, he returns to town to present the trophy head to Vincent for a nice reward.
Phases.
Archespore.
I have proof of having killed the archespore. I should take it to Vincent. "I need to get the proof of having killed the archespore to Vincent."
A Reward.
Vincent no longer holds the key to the coffer. I need to see the Royal Huntsman about my reward. "Vincent no longer disburses rewards. I need to find the Royal Huntsman."
A Reward.
I killed a very dangerous plant in the swamp. My pouch is now heavier by 400 orens. "I received my reward for the trophy." (400 + 3000 XP)

Finders Keepers is an optional quest which is given to Geralt by a shady character known as the "con artist" who hangs out near the entrance to the sewers in the Temple Quarter in the mornings. He would like a valuable ring retrieved from a dangerous place. Sounds like witcher's work.
Walkthrough.
An early morning stroll along the canal that channels filthy run off and rain water into the sewer may lead to an encounter with a con artist in need of Geralt's assistance. He loiters directly outside the sewer entrance, which is down a flight of stairs outside the Detective's house, blocked from view by the high brick wall, between 06:00 and 09:00 every morning.
It seems that he needs a ring retrieved from a crypt in the sewers. Unfortunately (especially for his associates who also tried to retrieve the ring earlier), the crypt is infested with ghouls and graveirs. To date, no one who has entered has returned alive. He asks the witcher to try his hand at retrieving the ring, promising as a reward that anything else found along the way can be kept in lieu of cash.
Geralt accepts and it is off to the sewers. The crypt is easy to find, it is immediately on the left inside the sewer entrance, through an iron gate to which the witcher now has a key. There are four graveirs (possibly five) and about five or six ghouls in the crypt. After dispatching them, the witcher finds the ring in a chest bearing the shield of Temeria in the large chamber in the northeastern part of the crypt. There is a campfire in the same room as the chest containing the quest items, this crypt is an excellent spot if you feel like taking the time to grind a little. If you do this some necrophage oil, and Cat potions will make it much easier. Each graveir gives 240 exp at level 12, decreasing by 5 every level gained. I did this for one full day after receiving the quest and gained about a level and a half.
The witcher then resurfaces to give the ring to his employer. At this point, the con artist lets it slip that this really was not "his" family ring, just "a" family ring and that he has used our hero to get what did not really belong to him. You win some, you lose some.
Phases.
Family Heirloom.
I was hired to recover some family heirlooms. I must go to the sewer and find a hiding place. The undead are probably nearby. My employer is interested only in a family signet ring, so I can keep the rest of the treasures. "I must go into the sewers and find a hidden cache."
Key.
I received a key to the crypt in the sewers. I must find the door this key fits. "I must find the door this key fits."
Success.
I found the heirlooms - a lot of them. Now I must return to my employer; I will find him at the sewer entrance. "I must return to my employer. I will find him at the sewer entrance." (500 XP.)
Loot.
I was deceived. The family heirloom turned out to be stolen goods. (2000 XP)

A Ghost Story is an optional quest in Chapter II or III which Geralt can undertake if he happens to meet a certain thug in a certain house in the slums. The quest does lead to a Romance card, but otherwise has no impact on the narrative.
Walkthrough.
A morning stroll into the wrong neighbourhood quickly climaxes into something more. When Geralt enters the door across from the warehouse in the Temple Quarter's slums during the day, after 6:00 am, and has a look around, he is likely to find a thug.
This thug will either already be there, sweeping, or enter after Geralt, if he arrives before 6:00 am. He will demand to know what the witcher is doing there, to which our hero will give one of his quick and less than informative retorts.
The thug will then offer the witcher a quest. Apparently, there is a haunted house not far away with some treasure going spare because of the specters. If Geralt meets him there and helps dispatch the ghosts, they can split the treasure. The thug marks the place on the map and leaves. Geralt follows him, but he is too quick and has already vanished from sight, so our hero must rely on his trusty map to find the dwelling.
Once there, he enters only to be ambushed by the same thug who sent him there and some backup in the form of three more ne'er-do-wells. It seems they have been holding a half-elf woman captive while waiting for the witcher. A skirmish breaks out, the usual course of action follows and Geralt checks that the damsel is no longer in distress.
She does not speak the language very well, but manages to communicate her thanks and that she will give the witcher a reward if he goes to see her later, in the non-human district. She says that she is staying at the dwarven blacksmith's house. This is "not" the living quarters above the Dwarven blacksmith shop, but the house facing Kalkstein's and Golan Vivaldi's places. It is separated from them by a low wall and so must be accessed from the alley off Peddler street next to the hospital.
Not being one to pass up a reward, Geralt finds the half-elf a while later, at the blacksmith's house and gets in a little practice speaking some Old Speech. If his memory serves him correctly, a roll in the sack ensues.
Phases.
A Ghost Story.
I should find out what's going on in a haunted house in the quarter of the poor. "I should find out what's going on in a haunted house."
The Half-Elf.
I killed the thugs who lured me into a trap. I think they wanted to kill the half-elf they were keeping. I should talk to her. "I should talk to the half-elf." (500 XP)
Reward.
The half-elf thanked me for rescuing her and promised to reward me. I should meet her at the house of the nonhumans. "I should meet the half-elf in the nonhumans' house." (2000 XP)

A Lost Lamb is a quest given to Geralt by Vaska in Chapter II, during his first visit to the Brickmakers' village in the swamp.
Walkthrough.
As our hero makes his way in and around Vizima, he ultimately ends up trudging through the swamp forest. In the forest there is a village of brickmakers, led by their eldress, Vaska. The witcher is initially looking for information on Berengar and the mysterious Mage's tower, but in the course of his investigation, he finds that the brickmakers have lost one of their own, a young boy.
Vaska believes the child has been kidnapped by druids to be transformed into a dryad, so Geralt's first stop is the Druids' grove to speak with them and get their impression of the situation. The druids laugh off the idea of kidnapping children. They only accept adults into their ranks. They certainly did not kidnap the boy, and turn him into a dryad? Honestly!
Luckily there is a dryad, Morenn, staying with the druids in the grove. The witcher can ask the dryad directly about transforming boys. Morenn also laughs off this suggestion, pointing out that only "girls" can be dryads. At this point, the conversation turns to where little dryads come from.
Morenn explains that dryads, having no men among them, take in men from other races to further their species. They take only the most agile and strong, hoping the young girls will inherit their fathers' physical attributes. Such a man would have to prove himself as a hunter, by bringing her a wolf pelt.
If brought a wolf pelt, the dryad intimates that she is fully aware that witchers are sterile and since no procreation could come of their union, there is no point. Geralt is not so easily dissuaded and points out that sex without procreation can be good. She counters that good just is not enough. He then suggests that sex relieves stress, which is good for the mind "and" body. She sees the logic in his argument and relents. They have sex.
But that does not find the lost boy, in fact, nothing does in Chapter II. It is not until Chapter III and the Reaping Time quest that our hero finally locates the missing child.
Phases.
Lost Boy.
Vaska claims the druids kidnapped a boy to turn him into a dryad. She asked me to find him. Perhaps I will go to the druids' grove and ask around about the boy. "I must ask the druids about the missing boy."
The Dryad.
The druid laughed at me when I told him about the brickmakers' suspicions. I will talk to the dryad. "I should talk to the dryad about the kidnapped boy." (500 XP)
To Vaska.
The dryad confirmed what the druids said and she also told me that dryads only kidnap little girls. I must go and tell Vaska that her suspicions were wrong. "I must go and tell Vaska that she was wrong in her suspicions."
A Promise.
I told Vaska that the boy's disappearance had nothing to do with the druids and I promised to bring him home if I find him. "I promised that I would take the boy home when I find him." (500 XP)
Found.
The kid was really messed up. Oh well, it's a good thing he was found. I should talk to Vaska about it. "I should talk to Vaska about the boy." (500 XP)
Success.
Vaska is grateful for finding the child. (2000 XP)

Giant centipede

Giant centipedes, (scientifically, "scolopendromorphs"), also known as "yghern" in Elder Speech, are found in the forest of Brokilon and possibly elsewhere. They are about twelve feet in length with dark brown chitinous armor. They are very dangerous and tend to wrap themselves around their victims before poisoning them. They are related to myriapodans.
While on their way to Duén Canell, Geralt and Braenn confront such a beast who is threatening what appears to be a halfling in the short story "The Sword of Destiny". The "halfling" ultimately turns out to be Ciri.

 "Among the fascinating flora and fauna of the duchy of Toussaint, one also encounters creatures of the decidedly unpleasant sort, such as giant centipedes. Not only do these beasts look hideous to the eye, they can do colossal damage to the flesh as well. I decidedly advise against them.– "A Visit to Toussaint," one of the many guides authored by Peterin Safles"
"Giant centipedes are enormous, insect-like monsters which can be found in many places in the world, but are particularly common in the lands (or more precisely, under the lands) of Toussaint. There they often dwell in close comity with shaelmaars, for a sort of monstrous symbiosis has developed between them: giant centipedes feed on the small creatures which eat Shaelmaar dung."
"Hard chitinous armor covers nearly the entire body of a giant centipede. Sticking out from under this carapace are rows of hooked limbs. Giant centipedes are able to burrow into the ground with shocking speed, only to then appear back on the surface in another place. Once they select a target, they will circle it determinedly, trying to get close enough to deliver a blow. They attack primarily with their powerful mandibles, but they also possess glands allowing them to spew acid."
"The greatest obstacle when fighting giant centipedes is their thick armor, which deflects most blows not only from weapons, but also from magical means – such as those dealt by simple spells or witcher Signs."
"When attacked with a weapon, they will often parry the strike, then quickly reply with their own forceful counter. Thus the best method for fighting them is to chatch them in an Yrden trap, keeping them from protecting themselves with their armor or burrowing into the ground."
Combat tactics.
The best way to deal with the giant centipede is the Yrden Sign trap; if it rises within one, the centipede will be paralyzed and won't be able to burrow, allowing you to get quite a few hits in; just make sure to land your hits in the front, and not the back, as it's largely immune to attack from there. Once hit several times it will curl into a protective loop. Make sure to roll away when this happens; not only is it a guard move that will make you do very little damage, after a couple of seconds it will swing its body around in a wide sweeping attack before burrowing in the ground to reappear elsewhere.

Dryads, also known as eerie wives by humans and "Aen Woedbeanna" in Elder Speech, are the nymphs of the woods, concentrated primarily in their forest realm of Brokilon. Born through sexual contacts with other races or transformed by the Water of Brokilon, they are exclusively female and their descendants remain so for many generations even without drinking the Water.
Transformed dryads are referred to as naturalized dryads, while the sub-race of dryads who have the deepest connection with the forest and are symbiotic with given tree are called hamadryads.
History.
Origins.
Some legends claim that the dryads' origin lies in the elven scheme to use enchanted human women in battles against Nordlings. While they are indeed spotted in certain elven ruins as guardians of the nature, according to the dwarves they were already present on the Continent ages before the arrival of either Nordlings or Aen Seidhe. There are even assumptions that dryads and other nymphs came here as early as the first trees, thus grouping them among the earliest colonizers of the world.
Contacts with other Elder Races.
Dryads generally ignored gnomes, perceiving them as not worthy of attention as long as they tended to their own matters and did not endanger nature. Their attitude towards dwarves was more hostile – mutually. The nymphs felt hatred for an industrial race polluting the natural environment, while the dwarves perceived them as savage barbarians.
The arrival of the Aen Seidhe changed the dryads both physically and culturally. Elven genes allowing long life and Elder Speech spread throughout the eerie wives, beautiful elven cities harmonious with nature changed the way the dryads perceived other intelligent races, though the idea of bending nature to one's will was still disgusting for keepers of the forest. The most shocking cultural impact was however yet ahead: the First Landing of humans.
War for the Forest.
At the beginning, humans perceived nymphs as monsters, demons who had to be either expelled or destroyed in order to obtain new lands. Leimoniads and oreads faced near extinction, the number of hamadriads were decreasing with each cut tree. By the 13th century, humans conquered or subjugated almost the whole area of now-called Northern Kingdoms and Brokilon became the sole independent habitat of the dryad race. While after the conquest some dryad cultures survived in other forests and forged a relative peace with Nordlings, it was Brokilon which was most famed. Brokilonian dryads never surrendered and swore to protect their forest until the last dryad falls dead protecting it.
Culture.
Dryads are known for their amazing archery skills and can easily kill a human from the distance of 200 feet without the person ever knowing they were there. They use this ability extensively to mark their border: if an arrow lands at one's feet or in a nearby tree, that's as far as the intruder is allowed to travel alive as the next shot, should they not heed the warning, will kill them. To prevent the decay of bodies from filling the air, the dryads tend to mark their border by the rivers so the bodies can be washed away with the current.
Dryads are also proficient in treating wounds. When Geralt was wounded in a fight with Vilgefortz, he had cracked ribs, a broken forearm and femur, and a concussion but, upon arriving in Brokilon, he was treated with expert care and was well enough to move when the bard Dandelion came to see him. They also did a similar feat with Freixenet, who was nearly dead from their attacks but, after being found by Geralt, the dryads patched him up to the point he was able to sit up and talk for a bit when the witcher rejoined him several days later.
Being dryads, they have a love for the trees, forest, and music and have learned to master abilities to shape trees to their will while not harming the tree itself. Since fire is forbidden in the forest, they instead create light, by stimulating certain fungi, and crafting a wreath out of the plant to make a light source. They generally sleep huddled up in groups for warmth on the forest floor.
Dryads do not eat dinner and the sentinels at the border rarely eat breakfast as well.
Characteristics.
Physical description.
Dryads tend to have a slender and small build. It is generally impossible to distinguish a naturally born dryad from the transformed one; only older girls who became dryads after 10 or up can be recognized due to lack of distinct dryad sweat which smells like willow's leaves.
Dryads and hamadryads are generally similar to humans and can be mistaken for them in certain situations, and vice versa.
Their hair is typically chestnut, green or red and is often dreadlocked. Born dryads rarely have blond or silver hair or blue eyes, but these can be inherited from human or elven fathers.
Their skin tones can be described as similar to humans, though often take on forest-like tints of olive, chestnut, red or green. At some occasions however they may appear entirely green. The exact shade is often unclear due to Brokilonian habit of painting skin into camouflage patterns by scouts and sentinels, as well as wearing clothes patched up out of their natural surroundings, like leaves and twigs, which help them to blend into the forest. Dryads living in settlements in the heart of the forest, like Queen Eithné, tend to wear more fanciful dresses.
Mental traits.
The relation between dryads and magic might be very strong, though the Sources are practically absent among members of this race. The Water of Brokilon often activates the magical abilities in young girls, in similar way the witcher mutagens do it in witchers.
Apart from the common sources of Power, of which the dryads utilize Air, Earth, and Water, dryads are also able to draw it from trees. No dryad however, especially a hamadryad, do it without a serious motivation, such as the enemy invasion. Even then she chooses the oldest and the largest tree in the area, to ensure that it survives without complication.
Procreation.
Dryads are exclusively female and use males of other humanoid races only for mating purposes, taking strong ones to pass their traits onto their children. While it might seem a pleasant occasion for some jovial men, dryads take mating very seriously. Even though some of them may form romantic relationships, they mostly perceive males as a means of procreation. Because of this they may sometimes grumble about witchers and other infertile males.
Apart from the sexual encounters, a dryad can be made by mutating a child of different race through drinking the mutagenic Water of Brokilon. While originally such fate was rather rare, wars with humans forced dryads to be less benign. Should any young girl wander into their forest, be her a peasant's child or even a princess, she is subjected to transformation. During Eithné's rule this policy went so far so the human children became abducted from areas outside Brokilon. However, the older the abducted girl, the more likely for her to have glimpses of past life and not to match skills of the pure dryads.

Disclaimer: the content below has not been released yet. It can be changed in patch or not appear at all.
"Scroll 1: It is common knowledge that among dryads – known also as eerie wives – you will find only women. They require human men for reproduction, which begs the question... What are they really? What is their origin?"
"Scroll 2: Many scholars contend that dryads do not comprise a unique race, like gnomes or vrans, but humans fundamentally altered by magic. If true, dryads would be considered cursed beings, not unlike werewolves..."
"Scroll 3: Indeed, one legend tells that the first dryads were ordinary human women, enchanted by elves to support the Aen Seide in battle. Rather than fulfill their intended purpose, however, they took to the forest and have remained there ever since."
"Scroll 4: And what of the eerie wives themselves? Have they knowledge of their origin? One ambitious student from Oxenfurt ventured to Brokilon to find out. Unsurprisingly, he was never heard from again... Yet a dozen-odd years later, scholars from his department spotted several young dryads who bore a striking resemblance to their lost colleague..."
"Chest 1: The number of dryads known by name can be counted on a single hand. One such dryad was Braenn, made famous by the ballads of Master Dandelion. Unlike most dryads, however, neither her eyes nor her skin were green – evidence she was once an ordinary human child, forever changed by the Waters of Brokilon. Under their influence, she forgot her past, even her true name. Despite her human past, she guarded borders of Brokilon with a ruthlessness equal to that of her dryad sisters."
"Chest 2: Contrary to common belief, dryads on rare occasion would permit humans into their forest. Among that privileged minority was Milva Barring, well-known human archer and guide. She was often contracted by enemies of Brokilon – unaware of her allegiances – to lead expeditions against the dryads... Every time leading her patrons into an ambush..."
"Chest 3: Dryads can survive even the gravest of wounds. Their ability to heal via magic is unrivaled. In fact, it was they who saved Geralt of Rivia following his brush with death against Vilgefortz. His bones crushed, it seemed the witcher might never walk again. But under Eithné's care, the White Wolf recovered and soon returned to the Path."

A half-elf is a child of a human and an elf or of two half-elves. Half-elves inherit characteristics of both their parent races, but are treated with distrust and often contempt by both elves and humans. A human with a quarter of elven blood is called a quarter-elf.
History.
In the years following 1263, many half-elves chose to support the Scoia'tael, due to the prejudice growing related to nonhumans. While some volunteered to join their ranks, others simply chose to provide shelter and food for the guerilla forces.
Appearance.
Like humans and elves, half-elves vary by appearance, with some easier to detect their half-blood status than others. For example, the half-elf Schirrú was commonly referred to as a half-elf before his name was even known to others, with a dead giveaway being his eyes: large, almond-shaped, and yellow-green. However, others, like Beatrix of Kovir, were said to display almost none of their elven heritage and even by human standards she was considered ugly.
"The Witcher".
During the quest "A Ghost Story", Geralt rescues a half-elf from a gang of thugs who have been holding her against her will in an abandoned house in the slums of the Temple Quarter. The following journal entry is the direct result of this rescue and its subsequent reward.
"Vizima is also home to half-elves, born of unions between humans and elves. Female half-elves are possessed of a delicate, inimitable beauty. Many are fluent in the Elder Language."
Romance card.
After Geralt saves her he can speak with her to get her card. She can be found in a house almost exactly opposite Vivaldi's place, across a small barrier (you can enter this part of the green light district from the St. Lebioda's hospital side).

Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, better known as Dandelion (Polish: "Jaskier"), was a poet, minstrel, bard, and close friend of the witcher Geralt of Rivia.
Biography.
Early life.
Not much is known about Dandelion's family except that he was of noble birth and was a cousin of Ferrant de Lettenhove, the royal instigator of Kerack.
He received his early education in a temple school, where, according to Geralt, literacy was "beaten into him with a cane". However, he didn't truly get into poetry until he was 19, after being inspired by his love for Countess de Stael. Dandelion studied the seven liberal arts for four years at Oxenfurt University before later becoming a professor, but only taught students for a year before leaving the academy to travel the world. He would, however, visit Oxenfurt from time to time to give guest lectures.
Within a very few years he gained worldwide fame and became known as one of the best minstrels in the Northern Kingdoms, with his best known song was the Ballad of the Lion Cub of Cintra.
Meeting Geralt.
In the mid-to-late 1240s, Dandelion first met Geralt at a fête in the town of Gulet in Aedirn. There, the poet had knocked up a girl under the musician's podium, and her four sturdy brothers were looking for him all over town, threatening to geld him and cover him in pitch and sawdust.
The so called Valley of Flowers seemed just right the right location for the duo's swift escape, as it was supposed to be the edge of the inhabited world, the last outpost of civilization. It was in the small town of Upper Posada, located in a part of the Northern Realms that later became Dol Blathanna, that the pair had their first adventure together, involving a nasty sylvan and an encounter with Dol Blathanna's native inhabitants, the elves. During this adventure, Dandelion received his priceless lute from Toruviel.
Temple of Ellander.
Later, in 1252, Dandelion was in Vizima and heard word of Geralt being injured and recovering at the Temple of Melitele in Ellander. He visited the temple and spoke to Nenneke, trying to win her favour, despite her annoyance of him flirting with one of the priestesses.
After, he went and saw Geralt and the two spent time discussing Dandelion's education, as well as the lack of work for the witcher. Later that day, the two left for the city of Ellander. Once they arrived in the city, they were confronted by Dennis Cranmer, Arthur Tailles and Count Falwick, and Geralt was forced to duel Tailles. After the conflict the witcher and the bard returned to the temple and said their goodbyes before leaving.
After the First Northern War.
In 1263, during the First Northern War, Dandelion was around the Yaruga, but fled far north, unknowing of Geralt's fate. He went to Pont Vanis, in Kovir and Poviss, to join King Esterad Thyssen's court. After a long time, he left the king's company to go to the Hengfors League, into service with King Niedamir. He also became an associate of the Redanian Secret Service, answering to Sigismund Dijkstra, who requested information on King Ervyll after Dandelion visited Verden.
Bleobheris.
In 1266, he performed a concert reciting stories of Geralt and Ciri to over a hundred at the giant oak Bleobheris in Velen. Donimir of Troy, Sheldon Skaggs and Radcliffe were among those who attended.
After sneaking away from the concert, he travelled to a nearby town and visited the brothel Mama Lantieri's. At the brothel, he was approached by the mage Rience, who was looking for Ciri. After refusing to give up information and attempting to run, Dandelion was tortured by Rience and two other men in the pigstys behind the brothel. Yennefer then appeared, scarring Rience's face, and creating a portal for the two of them to escape.
Oxenfurt.
After Yennefer's help, in early 1267, Dandelion went to Oxenfurt, to report details of Verden to Dijkstra. In the marketplace he marveled at the sights and services, noticing he was being tailed by two men, and so rode on to the Oxenfurt Academy, where he signed in at the main gate and watched the students and tutors hard at work.
As he entered the academy, he saw the young student Shani, and proceeded to pretend to flirt with her, as to detach attention from the two men following him. After she promised to deliver a message to Geralt, Dandelion went up to the men, who were spies working for Dijkstra. They led him to the spymaster, joined by Philippa Eilhart and Ori Reuven for the meeting. Sigismund revealed their true interest was Geralt, and asked the bard for information on his location. Dandelion played dumb, having already seen Geralt in Oxenfurt, and so Philippa pushed for information about Ciri instead. After the bard promised to try and arrange a meeting, he left the building and spent several hours lingering around the academy, visiting different faculties, until it got dark. He used the night to sneak across the city to Wolfgang Amadeus Goatbeard's house, a brewer friend of his where Geralt was staying. After entering through the attic window, and discovering Geralt and Shani naked, Dandelion revealed Dijsktra's main objective was to find Ciri, and so if Geralt didn't flee, he would be forced to give up information. As the three went to leave through the window, they were interrupted by Philippa who polymorphed from an owl, and told them Dijkstra was under strict orders from King Vizimir II and Shani revealed she knew Rience, as he had visited a local store owned by Myhrman two days previous.
That night, the four went to the docks where they broke into Myhrman's house, and Geralt and Philippa tortured him for information on Rience. They were able to obtain an magic amulet that Geralt used to message Rience, and before dawn they prepared to meet him. While Geralt dealt with the Michelet brothers and Rience, Dandelion and Shani stood on the palisades watching. After the last brother fell, Shani cried out and attempted to run and heal them as she was a medic, though Dandelion held her and told her it was too unsafe.
Meeting Ciri.
After Oxenfurt, Dandelion stopped in the city of Dorian in Temeria, where he told Codringher and Fenn of the events with Rience, somewhat limited by his promise of secrecy with Geralt. He next went with Geralt to Hirundum, the Hofmeier family farm, where he would spend nights discussing political matters with Bernie while Geralt hunted a monster. They were deep in a conversation during the stormy night of June 29th, when the young girl Ciri rode up to the farm, followed by Geralt and then Yennefer, all from different ways. The next morning's talk between the sorceress and witcher included an invitation for Dandelion to accompany them to Thanedd Island. The following day they all went to Thanedd, and during the reception at Loxia, Dandelion spent his time collecting gossip from the arriving mages.
After the reception, Dandelion found some minstrels and performed ballads to them throughout the night, including "Elusive". In the early hours of the morning however, a large-scale coup took place between the Brotherhood, with many siding with the North or Nilfgaard. Dandelion fled the conflict, and being told of Geralt's injuries and location by Triss Merigold, after the beginning of the Second Northern War, he travelled to the city of Brugge. There, he met with King Venzlav and told him of his mission to find Geralt so as to receive safe conduct through Brugge, which was met with a royal guard envoy. By early August, they escorted him to the Ribbon river near Brokilon, though left Dandelion somewhat short of the riverbank, fearful of the dryad's arrows. He rode his horse Pegasus deep into the forests where he found and began singing the ballad "Elaine Ettariel" to the dryad Fauve and her friend, who led him to the healing Geralt. He told the witcher of the events of the Nilfgaardian invasion, including details of the fall of Rivia and Aedirn. Fauve returned and the three of them noticed a group of Scoia'tael breaking through the tree line; Geralt left to aid them and so Fauve spoke quickly to Dandelion and then returned to the underbrush. After an hour, the witcher came back with Pegasus and another mare given to him by the Scoia'tael, before they set off from Brokilon to Nilfgaard, as Milva had told the witcher of a false Cirilla (unknowingly) who had been transported there.
On the road.
Geralt and Dandelion began their journey south following the Ribbon to the Ceann Treise falls, where they planned their march to Verden, and then further onto Cintra along the Yaruga. As they set off and a heavy storm hit, they were surprised by two havekars, Kolda and his boss, though were quickly let go due to the traders mistaking the pair for elves because of their Brokilonian clothes. As they went to leave, however, Imperial agents arrived to grab the havekar's tied-up prisoner: Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach. While first furious at the belief the traders had killed Cahir, due to him being tied up in a coffin, the meeting then turned into a mutiny when the Imperials attacked their so-called "allies". Milva then arrived, having been following Geralt's trail, and helped the witcher kill the remaining Imperials. Spotting the coffin again, the group opened it and untied Cahir, and upon Geralt's first unveiling and near-distain of the Vicovarian, they ambivalently decided to spare only his life, untie him, and leave him there to fend for himself, this being the second time the knight received mercy from the witcher, though he was warned of his doom should they meet again.
Despite Geralt's warning, Cahir took off after the group, though he never directly approached them. It was only several days later when the group, fed up with knowing someone was following them but not sure who, confronted them only to find Cahir once again in their presence. As Geralt demanded Cahir fight him, the knight stated he didn't wish to fight but to join them in rescuing Ciri. Geralt strongly objected to this, threatening to kill him once more but Cahir, unwillingly to pull out his weapon like Geralt demanded, reiterated that he didn't want to fight, leaving the two in a stalemate. Only when Milva stated she could put an arrow in his horse to prevent Cahir from catching up with them as they continued on did Cahir mount and run off.
Eventually, while travelling through the forest, they came across the dwarf Zoltan Chivay and his company. The dwarves told them of their plan to travel to the Turlough Hills, then the Old Road to the river Chotla in Sodden, before continuing onto the Ina. Zoltan, after hearing of the three wanderers journey south toward enemy clutches, invited them to join the dwarves on their march east, which was accepted.
Ciri returns.
In 1272, Dandelion was contacted by Ciri for aid in fixing a phylactery, which could either be used to cast or lift a curse; Ciri kept her objective to herself and Dandelion was unwilling to pry any further. Unfortunately, with mage hunts going on in Novigrad, Dandelion decided to turn to Whoreson Junior, a member of the Big Four crime lords of Novigrad. Junior agreed to find someone to repair the phylactery but for a steep price: he wanted Dandelion to steal Sigi Reuven's treasure and who was another Big Four.
Dandelion eventually conjured up a plan with the help of Dudu and Kalkstein and while he succeeded in getting the treasure, the commander of the Temple Guard, Caleb Menge, found out and took the treasure for himself. Believing the bard had betrayed him, Whoreson Junior's men chased Dandelion and Ciri all the way to Temple Isle. Ciri manged to barely escape from being killed by teleporting away, but Dandelion was unfortunately captured by Menge's men and was jailed while Menge waited to publically execute the bard on Oxenfurt.
Known ballads.
During his travels with Geralt, Dandelion started to write his memoirs, entitled "Half a Century of Poetry"; twice, in fact. His first attempt was lost in the bottom of the duchess of Toussaint's closet after the poet was banished from her duchy. But rather than bemoaning that loss, the poet decided to rewrite his memoirs from scratch. His poems were later bound in two collections: "The Adversities of Loving" and "Time of the Moon". The following are the named ones:
"The Witcher".
In the game, Dandelion is an avid dice poker player, a sharper rank. From Chapter III onward, Geralt can play him for the sheer pleasure of the game and orens, but officially, it is only in Chapter IV that he can play the bard as part of the .
"I've heard rumors that the famous bard and poet Dandelion visited the Outskirts."
"I met Dandelion, who has supposedly always been my best friend. From what I've heard, Dandelion is an indefatigable windbag, a buffoon, and a wastrel. He is also a womanizer with an incredible talent for getting into trouble. At the same time, Dandelion is a truly talented artist, despite his tendency to wander the countryside and eke out a living through occasional performances."
"Dandelion got into trouble and I had to help him out. Everything I've heard about him has proven to be true."
"A friend in need is a friend indeed. Dandelion somehow convinced Triss that I needed him and she teleported him here. He has joined me in my exile in Murky Waters."
"I ran into Dandelion again and I think it was no coincidence. Either Dandelion wants to aid me in my search or he wants to witness the end of this journey so he can compose a ballad afterwards. It could also be both."
"A troubadour and bon-vivant, Dandelion is an old friend and companion. Known for his promiscuous lifestyle and romances, he also has an incredible talent for getting into trouble."
"".
Dandelion first appears in Flotsam as he's about to be hanged at the main square for debauchery and burning down one of Flotsam's buildings. Geralt, Triss, and Vernon Roche (for whom Dandelion has secretly been working as a spy) come across this scene and deal with the problem.
 "It is always awkward to write about oneself, yet I cannot shirk this duty. In an effort to preempt any accusations of partiality, I shall set down the humblest of notes, relating only the best-known facts. Dandelion, in reality the Viscount de Lettenhove, though titles are unimportant, is a certified troubadour, a lecturer at Oxenfurt University, a persona known among society as a charmer, poet, dandy and unparalleled lover. Almost everyone north of the Yaruga has heard of him, and those who have not are either boors or simpletons or both, as a result of which their opinions do not matter in the slightest. Dandelion played a significant part in the most important events of the era. He loved, fought, negotiated, and acquired immense knowledge, even that of the forbidden variety. His works are a testimony of the times, but it is his moving poetic tropes that have brought him true fame. The important thing in this story is that Dandelion was a friend to Geralt of Rivia – possibly his only true friend. He was Geralt's confidant, advisor, and companion in misery (for it was impossible to experience good fortune in the witcher's company). What Geralt did, Dandelion faithfully recounted, and one should not give credence to those who accuse this humble chronicler of confabulating."
 "Discretion, a virtue I have always professed, obliges me to remain silent about the circumstances in which, through the person of Vernon Roche, I began working with the Temerian intelligence service. Suffice it to say that there comes a moment in everyone's life when, facing great events, they cannot remain indifferent. And so I could not stand aside as history took shape before my very eyes. My dedication to the cause brought me to Flotsam at the time. There, through an unfortunate incident involving twins at the local brothel, a town guard, a dog, a cat, and an oil lamp, I wound up on the scaffold in the town square, from which I barely escaped with my life."
 If Geralt chooses Roche's path during the end of chapter I:
 "Obviously, when Geralt decided to continue his search in King Henselt's military camp, located in a borderland soon to be engulfed by the flames of war, I chose to accompany him, for the witcher could at times be naive as a child and knew as much about politics as a ghoul knows about cooking. Thus the chances were slim to none that, bereft of my help, he would manage to find new leads without getting embroiled in some trouble along the way. As his friend, I clearly could not allow that."
 "In hindsight, the pamphlet against Henselt's rule could have been better written, yet I am pleased with it anyway. I'm not accustomed to ignoring human misfortune, and Henselt made a mistake when he insulted art – I was merely the instrument of its retribution."
 "When Geralt and Roche headed for Loc Muinne to meet their destiny, I had little desire to sit in Henselt's camp. Despite their victory, the Kaedwenis' mood was as sour as milk in the udders of a dead cow. Therefore I packed up, resolving to reach Loc Muinne in time to witness the important events transpiring there. This was not to be, however, as Geralt's arrival accelerated events as usual. Thus I know the rest of the story only from the accounts of others, yet I present it here as faithfully as possible – anything omitted was surely not worth a mention in the first place."
If Geralt chooses Iorveth's path during the end of chapter I:
 "Obviously, when Geralt decided to continue his search in Vergen, located in a borderland soon to be engulfed by the flames of war, I chose to accompany him, for the witcher could at times be naive as a child and knew as much about politics as a ghoul knows about cooking. Thus the chances were slim to none that, bereft of my help, he would manage to find new leads without getting embroiled in some trouble along the way. As his friend I clearly could not allow that."
 "Having taken part in many adventures by Geralt's side, when he asked for my help I agreed without hesitation. I had already been imperiled when helping him in less rewarding tasks than using poetry to lure an unparalleled demonic lover. Thus I had the chance to risk my life in the name of three most beautiful values: friendship, poetry and love – there was no other decision to make."
 "Geralt and Iorveth headed for Loc Muinne to meet their destiny, yet I decided to stay in Vergen a bit longer. I had more than enough material for new ballads, therefore I fought the urge to reach Loc Muinne in time to witness the important events transpiring there. Thus I know the rest of the story only from the accounts of others, yet I present it here as faithfully as possible – anything omitted was surely not worth a mention in the first place."
"I would wager anyone that you, dear reader, are a person of culture and taste - and therefore already familiar with me, Dandelion, and the role I am to play in the following tale. Nevertheless, allow me to sketch a few lines by way of self-portrait, for the sake of thoroughness, and in the event you have spent much of the last half-century in some dark corner where the light of my star has yet to reach."
""Born in 1229, a talented poet and troubadour, a graduate of Oxenfurt Academy, a frequent performer at royal courts, an unequaled lover appreciated, and in some cases adored, by ladies worldwide, a skilled negotiator and a stirring orator" - such is the image of the bard Dandelion as painted by his friends and promoters."
"This image is, of course, somewhat overbright in its coloring - I personally prefer to think of myself as a dedicated artist in thrall to his Muse, one whose work has benefited immeasurably from the fact that I was, am and forever will remain a close friend and steadfast companion to the witcher Geralt. It is his fate I chronicle in this present work and his story which I shall sing till the end of my days."
"Having learned of my disappearance, Geralt dropped everything to find out what had become of me. Though at first he suspected the cause of my trouble lay in my many and turbulent affairs of the heart, he later determined that I had strayed into a life of crime, seeking to steal treasure belonging to one of the leaders of Novigrad's underworld."
"The motivations for my actions became clear some time later. I proved that, when it came to helping Cirilla, I would not balk at sticking my head into the lion's maw, let alone crossing such common scum as Cyprian Wiley, better known (for good reason!) as Whoreson."
"Only a madman calls it courage to fight when faced with overwhelming odds. Though known for my capricious and unpredictable charm, I am not yet considered mad, and so, while defending my companion's escape to the very last, I ultimately allowed the temple guard to take me to their prison, where I awaited my imminent execution."
"The saying does not lie - "true friends show when fortune hides her face." My dear comrades gave ample evidence of this by breaking me free from my prison transport, saving me from certain and painful death."
"Julian Alfred Pankratz Viscount de Lettenhove, better known as Dandelion—a minstrel, poet, and lecturer at the Oxenfurt Academy, and also the best friend of Geralt of Rivia. His love of women, spirits, and the sound of his own voice is constantly getting him into trouble and then providing him the means to get out of it. Those who underestimate him commit a grave error—this seemingly harmless bard is capable of unmatched feats of intellect and diplomatic maneuvering. A friend to kings, and a lover to the most influential women in the realm, one word from his lips can carry more power than an army of tin-plated brutes—provided it's not interrupted by a wine-scented belch."
"Thanks to his vast network of contacts, Dandelion rarely engages in combat. He has others to do the dirty work for him. To fuel his vagabond, yet lavish, lifestyle, the minstrel needs a hefty amount of cash; therefore—when he's not drinking—you'll frequently see him giving concerts and also providing that extra special encore for the ladies in the audience. Be it a slap on the cheek or a fat purse, the man always gets his share. Dandelion is a force of chaos and serendipity, the only person that can turn a hopeless situation into a surefire success...and the other way around."
"He finds silver linings where others see only dark clouds; yet, frequently to his own peril, he can't keep his mouth shut when silence is worth far more than twice his weight in gold."

Scoia'tael

Scoia'tael were nonhuman guerrillas also known as the Squirrels, due to the squirrel tails they wore on their hats/caps, that they primarily lived in the forest, and that they ate nuts.
Racism and deep-seated discrimination against nonhumans inflamed a great hatred of humans amongst nonhumans in the Northern Kingdoms. Most of the Squirrels were elves, however it wasn't uncommon to find halflings, dwarves (distinguished by their non-standard plaited beards), gnomes and half-elves among them. Scoia'tael were divided into commandos (considered to be a gnomish term) comprised of several fighters.
Bigger, more highly promoted commandos were rare and strictly established during battles or for special tasks (e.g. during the Thanedd coup). The most well-known Scoia'tael special tasks group was the Vrihedd Brigade, commanded by Isengrim Faoiltiarna. They were identified by their silver lightning bolt symbol.
Scoia'tael were allied with Nilfgaard and used by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis for diversion, as well as support for the Nilfgaardian Army during the Second Northern War. In exchange for their support, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis gave the elves Dol Blathanna as their own, independent state, and made Enid an Gleanna its queen. After the Peace of Cintra, they were condemned as outlaws even by their elven queen.
History.
In 1263, at the start of the First Northern War, the Scoia'tael were established, starting a guerilla war over the following years, attacking trade caravans and northern army regiments, such as Beeches and Badger Ravine, hoping that the Nilfgaardians would be successful in their invasion, and that the elven rule may reinstated if all the humans were killed. They continued their campaign for a while, with the goal of pushing back the "humans to the sea", and the phrase becoming a war cry in their attacks.
In February 1266, they attacked a fort in Kaedwen, laying waste to many soldiers in a brutal battle. Afterwards they were tipped off by Kaedwenian soldiers to Yarpen Zigrin's company, that was leading a "special" convoy through the woods. At the elven palace of Shaerrawedd, a regiment attacked the company, as well as Geralt, Ciri, and Triss, who were travelling with them. The group killed Vilfrid Wenck, Paulie Dahlberg and Yannick Brass, before the Dun Banner arrived and slaughtered the elves. Demavend III of Aedirn afterward set up a specific group called the Aedirnian Special Forces to repel the forces.
By early 1267, after Foltest, Demavend, and Henselt spent a year conducting operations against the Scoia'tael, their numbers were greatly reduced and the commandos were forced to retreat to the forests in smaller groups. The members captured were tortured in town squares, and left to rot on roadside posts, pecked to pieces by the crows and ravens, as a warning to other members.
In July, after the beginning of the Second Northern War, and Francesca Findabair's ascension to queen of Dol Blathanna, Emperor Emhyr stipulated instead of recalling the guerrilla fighters to the capital, she would allow them to continue creating chaos in the north. Concurrently, for their support Foltest and Henselt demanded she not help them, leaving the Scoia'tael without aid from anywhere except Brokilon, where Milva guided members from their decimated commandos to, allowing them rest and their wounds healed. In August, they helped the Nilfgaardians conquer Brugge in several smaller skirmishes, such as the precedent battle of the village near Owl Hills on the 7th.
Battle tactics.
Although there are some cases where they fought in a vanguard (like during the sack of Vengerberg, or the Battle of Brenna), Scoia'tael usually remained hidden in the woods, where they waited in the vegetation for a convoy or a cavalry squadron to ambush.
When it came to buying equipment and weapons, since they were rejected by society and by most of the merchants and weapon-smiths, the Scoia'tael usually dealt with havekar, local smugglers who could provide them with supplies and arms at high prices.
 Elves
""The Scoia'tael are a group of elven and dwarven rebels fighting against the discrimination of nonhumans. They are divided into commando groups, or independent squads. Their protest against racism quickly turned to violence. Scoia'tael rob merchant caravans, plunder and burn villages, and kill. Instead of finding a peaceful solution, humans send troops to fight them. Scoia'tael means 'squirrel' in elven and the name probably comes from the rebels' habit of attaching squirrel puffs to their clothing."
"According to the author of "The Aftermath of the War", the Scoia'tael are inspired by Nilfgaard and other powers. The leaders of the rebellion send their people to certain death because they are blind or manipulated. The author also claims that wars between humans and non-humans will never cease because there is too much hostility between the races. In his opinion, the elves are doomed to extinction.""
"The Witcher".
Notes.
The book The Feudal Society and Its Enemies provides a journal entry on dwarves and squirrels.
"Scoia'tael is a name used by the rebels fighting for nonhuman freedom. In the common tongue it means "squirrels". As some would have it, it is because of squirrel tails that adorn the rebels' caps, or from the forest board they had to survive on. Scoia'tael formed units over a score strong, consisting mainly of elves, yet sometimes dwarves and halflings joined too. During the last war against Nilfgaard, the Scoia'tael fought on the side of the Empire, making diversions and great damage beyond our lines. Despite the provisions of the Peace of Cintra, many did not disarm and continued to fight, especially when it turned out that Nilfgaard sacrificed them in the name of peace and gave the units' leaders to the Nordlings to be executed."
Notable Scoia'tael.
Although the Scoia'tael play a less important role in " due to the Third Northern War, there are appearances of several camps and a few side quests revolving around the elves.
They also have their gwent card deck containing all important leaders, dwarves, elves, and hav'caars.
"Terrorists or freedom fighters? Squirrels, or Scoia'tael as they call themselves in the Elven tongue, is a common name for various nonhuman splinter groups that forcefully oppose the racial inequality resulting from maltreatment by humans on the Continent. Their name comes from their lifestyle: living in forests and frequently changing locations, these small communities are highly mobile and always ready to strike when no one expects them. Consisting mainly of elves, the Scoia'tael also harbor members of other races, such as dwarves and halflings. A typical unit is formed by joining several members of a given group; the larger ones, with a few dozen members, were generally task-oriented, put together for a specific mission. The objectives of such groups vary from assassinations and battlefield diversions to trade route harassment and espionage. The Socia'tael's symbol is a squirrel tail attached to their hats or other parts of their garments. As for their political affiliation, the group was once allied with the Nilfgaardian Empire, and in return Emhyr var Emreis provided the Elves with their own country, Dol Blathanna—then forced the Free Elves to disown the Scoia'tael as war criminals, leaving them to fend for themselves in a hostile North."
 "Scroll 1: Not many on the Continent understand Elder Speech – the language of the elves and dwarves. That said, all are familiar with the word "Scoia'tael," or Squirrels – warriors who fight for the rights of non-humans... And don't shy away from cruelty..."
 "Scroll 2: Thrown into crowded ghettos, harrassed at every street corner, elves and dwarves awaited the perfect moment to strike back at the callous kingdoms of the North. That moment came during the war against Nilfgaard. As the Imperials crossed the border, the non-humans began their fight from within."
 "Scroll 3: As devoted allies of Nilfgaard, no mission for the Scoia'tael was too risky – no sacrifice too great. Yet when it turned out the Empire had overestimated their own might and were forced to seek peace with the Northern Kingdoms, the newborn alliance quickly began to unravel..."
 "Scroll 4: Betrayed by Nilfgaard, despised by the Northern Realms, the Scoia'tael were in no position to achieve victory. Yet, by no measure did this mean they would surrender. Overcome with hatred, they continue to fight – not for victory, but vengeance."
 "Chest 1: The Scoia'tael's identifying symbol is a squirrel tail pinned to the belt or cap. Perhaps it has something to do their nimbleness and agility in the forest. If not, then their decision to use this particular rodent is indeed puzzling. Not least because in the regions with the greatest Scoia'tael presence, squirrels are on the brink of extinction. Oh, the irony..."
 "Chest 2: The Scoia'tael do not employ the rigid hierarchy of traditional armies. The partisans are divided into groups called commandos, each usually about a dozen strong. The unit's commander is typically a warrior who has displayed exceptional bravery... As well as extreme cruelty toward humans."
 "Chest 3: It is worth emphasizing that not every non-human supports the Scoia'tael. Many perceive the partisans as shortsighted, naive rebels who likely do more harm than good. The sharpest criticisms of the Squirrels, interestingly enough, came from none other than Brouver Hoog... Characteristically ignorant to the nuances of non-human affairs, most humans nevertheless lump them all into the same group."

Shani (d. 1340) was a medic, having studied at Oxenfurt Academy. She participated in the Battle of Brenna as part of the staff of Milo "Rusty" Vanderbeck's field hospital and, many years later, she became the Dean of the Department of Medicine of her alma mater.
She died in 1340, 72 years after the Battle of Brenna, at 90 years old.
Biography.
Studying at the Academy.
In 1267, Shani was a 17 year old, third year medical student attending Oxenfurt Academy. It's unclear how she and Dandelion met, but the two were friendly enough that when the bard came by to visit that year, he called her over from where she was sitting and the two pretended to flirt as Dandelion was being followed by some of Sigismund Dijkstra's spies. He then asked her to go and deliver a message to the witcher Geralt, who was hiding in Oxenfurt in his hunt to find the mage, Rience, and the two split off.
While she successfully found and delivered the message, she and Geralt also proceeded to engage in sex before being interrupted by Dandelion and then Philippa Eilhart. As the group discussed the reason Geralt was in the city, the conversation turned to Rience and Shani spoke up, asking if he had a really bad burn mark on one side of his face. With everyone looking at her in wonderment, Shani explained that tuition was too costly for her stepfather to cover all of it so she'd been stealing supplies from the school and selling on the side to a local named Myhrman. One day when conducting such business, Myhrman had been entertaining a guest he called "Master Rience" with a burn mark on his face and who'd made unwanted advances at Shani before Myhrman told him to cut it out as he still wanted to do business with the medical student. With this new information, the group asked Shani to take them to the local, who was now Geralt's best lead in finding Rience.
That same night, Shani led them to Myhrman's home: a small tower out in the waters that was only accessible with a draw bridge that Myhrman controlled. However, Shani convinced Myhrman to lower it and the group entered before Geralt and Philippa began to interrogate him on what he knew of Rience. Shortly after, Geralt was able to send a message to the mage and the two met out on the streets, though Rience had brought several hired killers. After the mage ran, letting the Michelet brothers fight Geralt, the witcher quickly cut all four of them down. Shani, who'd been standing on the bridge with Dandelion, saw the men fall and screamed out, attempting to rush over and save them, but Dandelion held onto her due to the dangerous situation. However, Geralt had been badly wounded and while he almost succeeded in killing Rience, Philippa cast a paralyzing spell on the witcher, letting Rience escape. With Geralt suffering from a great loss of blood, Philippa asked Shani, who'd now joined them, to be ready to help as the witcher was going to pass out soon and would need to be patched up quickly.
The following year, in March 1268, the Battle of Brenna took place and she worked in one of the field hospitals under Milo "Rusty" Vanderbeck. Despite Rusty believing Shani was too young and would soon keel over from either exhaustion or from the gruesome operations, she proved she was quite capable of helping out. Even if she wasn't fully trained in other areas, like sewing up a patient, Rusty simply told her to sew "red to red, yellow to yellow, white to white" which eventually became a famous joke of hers many years later as the dean of the Department of Medicine at Oxenfurt Academy.
After Vizima.
After she left Vizima in 1270, she returned to Oxenfurt to finish her doctorate before opening her own practice within the city. However, as the city was part of Redania, this also meant she had to be ready when called upon by Redania's Army with various urgent matters. By 1272, she was doing well for herself when she was ordered to assist with finding a cure for those being poisoned by something in the city's waters. This eventually led to her entering the sewers with a full army unit to try and find the unknown monster within, while she went to get fresh samples to make an antidote. However, they were attacked by the monster and Shani barely escaped with her life thanks to several of the men's sacrifices to get her to safety.
As she fruitlessly tried to save one of them, Geralt, having been sent on a separate contract to kill the monster, ran into her here and together they explored the sewers to try and find the monster's lair, as that was where Shani would likely find a clean sample. After they found it, Geralt then sent her to hide, with strict orders to run if the monster appeared. Following the witcher's instruction, she did run back home, thankfully not being spotted by Ofiri soldiers who'd also entered the sewers to try and rescue their cursed prince.
Back in her clinic, she successfully created an antidote to heal those sickened by the toad's poison before Geralt approached her once more, this time requesting help in learning the location of the Von Everec family crypt. As it was a place known for beautiful architecture during its prime, and as the witcher needed a censer only she could acquire from the academy, she invited herself along to see the crypt. However, to complete his task, this meant Olgierd's dead brother's ghost, Vlodimir, took temporary possession of Geralt. As Shani needed a date to a friend's wedding, she offered Vlodimir/Geralt to accompany her and he heartily agreed, not holding back on flirting with her.
With Vlodimir/Geralt by her side, the two had a good time at the wedding. However, she had to go think things over about where she and Geralt stood and concluded to just remain friends, as she needed someone who'd be home at the end of everyday. Geralt then requested if she could look into Olgierd some more to learn exactly who he was. While she didn't find anything in the books, she did learn of a Professor Premethine Shakeslock who had known Olgierd.
"If Geralt talks to her to learn more:" Shani helped Geralt into the locked down academy so he could talk to Shakeslock, while she returned home.
Shortly after, she packed up her clinic and left for the eastern front in Kaedwen, as the Redanian Army had called on her to help tend to their wounded there.
"The Witcher".
In "The Witcher", Geralt meets Shani in the Outskirts of Vizima, trying to get into the city in order to help treat victims of the Catriona at St. Lebioda's Hospital. She is surprised to see him, because, as she tells him, "I heard you died". While in the Outskirts, Shani stays at the Inn, healing Geralt whenever he enters, and looking after Alvin until Abigail takes him under her wing.
Once in Vizima, Shani can be found in St. Lebioda's Hospital during the day (roughly from 9:00 to 18:30), and in the streets or at home during the evening, night and early morning. If Geralt visits her at the hospital, Shani will heal him.
She lives near the statue of the aesculapian snake off the merchant's area in the Temple Quarter of Vizima. Her apartment upstairs can be difficult to get to because of Grandma who stands vigil downstairs. It seems that Grandma has lived a full life but now, in retirement, she prefers to play sentry.
To get past Grandma, Geralt can use sweet talk, gifts (alcohol or a pair of gold gloves), some orens, or a particular ring. Sometimes this will gain him entry only that one time, other times permanent entry is gained.
Old Friend of Mine takes place almost completely in Shani's house. Over the course of the evening, we learn that years ago, Dandelion interrupted something between Shani and Geralt. After the party ends, and Geralt's thank-you or apology, Shani reveals just what it was that the bard had so rudely interrupted. If you give her a red rose, sex will ensue.
The medic is also an invaluable resource during the witcher's investigation in Vizima. As the only medical professional, she is the only one who can conduct an autopsy. Luckily for Geralt, she is a friend.
In Chapter III, Geralt is forced to choose a guardian for Alvin, his only options being Shani and Triss Merigold. If he chooses Shani, he gets a second chance to know her better. If not, he neither sees nor hears from her again until Chapter V, where she relocates to create a field hospital of her own, treating plague victims and the casualties of the battle, regardless of race or affiliation.
"Soon after I arrived in the Outskirts I met Shani, an acquaintance from a long time ago, in quite dramatic circumstances. Shani is completely devoted to medicine, her passion, and she had plenty to do in the Outskirts, so there was no time for small talk. I got the impression that this sensible, intelligent girl likes me a lot."
"I dragged Shani into the business with Salamandra, and although the girl was in danger, it all ended well. Shani finished what she had to do in the Outskirts and returned to Vizima, to her house in the Temple Quarter."
"Shani works at Saint Lebioda's Hospital during the day and spends evenings at her lodgings in the Temple Quarter. She hates it when people disturb her at work so it's best to visit her later in the day."
"During the party Shani recounted her experiences during the Battle of Brenna, where she tended to the wounded. I have a feeling Shani has come to like me a lot."
if Geralt left Alvin with Triss:
"I left Alvin in Triss' care. Shani decided that I don't trust her and that I prefer the sorceress. She is angry with me, and it seems our affair is over."
if Geralt left Alvin with Shani:
"I've decided to leave Alvin in Shani's care. The medic took my choice to be a proof of my trust. She decided that I like her more than Triss, which only improved our relationship."
"Dandelion delivered a letter from Shani. The girl asks me to find Alvin, who has gone missing. Her letter exudes worry for the boy and me - Shani hopes to see us both soon and also hopes we can become a family."
"I answered Shani's letter and explained my feelings."
"Shani has moved back to rebellion-torn Old Vizima. She is tending to the wounded of both factions in a makeshift field hospital."
"I met Shani, or actually a vision of her created by my mind, in the Ice Plains. The medic aided me as I pursued the Grand Master."
Journal entry (Enhanced Edition).
if Geralt left Alvin with Shani:
 "Some of you have surely heard the rumors about the relationship that bloomed between the young medic Shani and Geralt. I hasten to inform you that they are all true. I consider Shani a friend both true and old. We go back to the days when I lectured in minstrelsy at Oxenfurt University, and I was the one to introduce her to the witcher. Upon Geralt's return to the living, they were reunited in Vizima, where the red-haired medic competed with Triss Merigold for Geralt's heart. She emerged victorious from the rivalry. The flame of their romance blazed bright, but it burned out quickly. Though a very young woman, Shani proved more mature than the witcher, who had always found relationships puzzling and difficult. Geralt would dodge his obligations towards her, preferring instead to pursue the missions King Foltest assigned him. The medic quickly realized this flour would yield no bread. She had a serious conversation with the witcher, and they parted amicably. Shani accepted an offer to teach at Oxenfurt and left for that city, whereas Geralt followed Foltest to the lands of the La Valettes. After splitting with Shani, the witcher needed comforting and quickly found solace in Triss Merigold's arms."
 "Geralt entered the Oxenfurt sewers expecting to hunt down a hideous monster – so you can imagine his surprise when down one of those dank, slimy corridors he ran into Shani, an old and dear friend. Geralt and I had first met this extraordinary young woman years earlier, when she was just a coltish coed, but by this time she had grown into a dignified doctor and a fearless field medic for the Redanian Army."
 "This latter role had led her, and a unit of soldier escorts, to descend into the sewers. Their goal was to gather a sample of the venom spewed by the monstrosity squatting there. Geralt, a gentleman through and through, agreed to help her in her task."
 "Geralt's encounter with Vlodimir von Everec reminded him that he and Shani had once shared passionate (though passing) feelings for each other. He also became aware some remnant of these feelings was still lodged in his heart..."
 "At times fate composes tales so shocking no poet would dare put his name to them, for fear his public would mock them as overly outlandish. Such was the case when Geralt and the ghost of Vlodimir von Everec shared a body for an evening and accompanied Shani to the wedding of Aldona, her friend from the Academy. Some might have let this unusual escort interfere with their enjoyment of the evening – but not Shani. Looking around at the tasteful wedding decorations, smelling the rich odor of berry-laden rowan – a plant near and dear to her heart, one which summoned up fond childhood memories – Shani felt the heedless abandon of her younger years return and, overjoyed, threw herself into the thick of the festivities."
 "One thing is certain – Shani was not bored by the company of Vlodimir von Everec, who showered her with professions of burning desire and swept her off her feet with his maniacal energy. Yet when the hour came for him to return to the netherworld, she breathed a sigh of relief, for now she could spend some time alone with Geralt, who was much more sensitive and predictable (though Vlod would probably just call him boring)."
 "A pleasantly-begun evening blossomed into a night of rapture, then settled into a golden dawn on the shores of a lake, serenaded by nature's first awakening murmurs. Though Shani seemed delighted by this course of events, the morning air had put her in a reflexive mood. She parted ways with Geralt, explaining she had to think through what had just happened."
 "Fate decreed Shani would not linger long in her hometown of Oxenfurt. For as long as the war lasted, she was the Redanian army's to command, and her commander had decided to send her to Kaedwen, the conflict's eastern front. Before setting off she managed to inform Geralt about a certain Professor Shakeslock, who might be able to help with Gaunter O'Dimm. Geralt thanked his friend and they parted ways, hoping they would meet again, later or, quite preferably, sooner."

Zoltan Chivay was a veteran of the Second Nilfgaard War and a friend of the witcher Geralt of Rivia. They first met when Geralt and Zoltan's company were going towards the Yaruga river from Brokilon, but the dwarf advised them to join his company and go eastwards. It is from Zoltan that Geralt got his sword - a sihil.
After the Battle of Brenna, where him and his mates killed Field-Marshal Menno Coehoorn, Zoltan got engaged to Eudora Breckenriggs.
He also had a talking parrot, Field Marshal Windbag, which he sold to the gnome Percival Schuttenbach when he started a jeweler's workshop in Novigrad following the war.
Biography.
Forming a company.
When the Second Northern War erupted in July 1267, the dwarves, Chivay, Munro Bruys, Caleb Stratton, Yazon Varda and Figgis Merluzzo, along with a gnome named Percival Schuttenbach and a green parrot named Field Marshal Windbag, formed a company to escape from the enemy front and reach Sodden, passing through the Turlough Hills, the river Chotla and the Ina.
Stopping in Dillingen, the group waylaid and robbed a rich hawker who tried to flee the town after the townsfolk exposed his trade with the Scoia'tael. The merchant defended his property like a lion, shouting for aid several times before the dwarves attacked him with batons. Intending to fund future enterprises of each individual with the treasure, the group helped load the trunks on a wagon and set off into the forest. During their trip forward, they met some refugees from Kernow (only women and children), and they decided to help them and travel with them.
Meeting Geralt.
In early August, three days after joining the refugees, they found the witcher Geralt of Rivia with his friends Dandelion and Milva, and told them of the dwarves' plan to travel to the Turlough Hills, then the Old Road to the river Chotla in Sodden, before continuing onto the Ina. Zoltan invited the three wanderers to join them on their march east, which was accepted.
"The Witcher".
 Geralt first meets Zoltan in the Outskirts of Vizima, surrounded by thugs. After giving them a sound beating, the dwarf is surprised and very happy to see Geralt, whom he claims to have witnessed dying five years earlier with his very own eyes.
During the ensuing chat, the dwarf also mentions that his in-laws-to-be, the Breckenriggs (this name is spelled in a few different and interesting ways throughout the game: Breckering, Breckenridge, ...), who value material possessions more than Zoltan does. Lucky thing, since he has far fewer after the Common Cause Mine failed.
Zoltan is the one to acquaint Geralt with dice poker, and to give him a couple of pointers about whom to challenge. After the initial meeting, he can be found in the Inn for the remainder of Chapter I.
Later in the game, Zoltan can be found wandering around the Temple Quarter (roughly from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.) and, if choosing to side with the Scoia'tael or take the neutral path, in the Old Vizima. He also often spends time with Golan Vivaldi. Arrives at Golan Vivaldi's home at 10:30 during chapter 2.
If Geralt outdrinks him at the Inn, Zoltan will give him a diamond.
"The dwarf's name is Zoltan Chivay. He claims to have witnessed my death years ago in Rivia. Zoltan seems reasonable and pragmatic. He takes the world with a grain of salt and sees irony in most things. Just like other nonhumans, he also seems vexed by the racist atmosphere in Temeria."
"I helped a dwarf being attacked by racists. He recognized me as an old friend of his."
"In front of the inn in the Outskirts a group of racists attacked a dwarf, but I ignored them. It turned out the dwarf is an old friend of mine."
"Zoltan managed to get to the Temple Quarter. The dwarf was happy to see me again."
"I met Zoltan again. This time it was on a hill, when the fight between nonhumans and the Order began for earnest."
"Zoltan organized the nonhumans' escape from the ghetto. I helped him and the group managed to get through the burning city. I bade farewell to Zoltan. I have a feeling I will not be seeing him soon."
"".
Zoltan once again appears in the second witcher game. His appearance has only slightly changed. Although originally expected to have the same voice actor as the original witcher game, he was ultimately voiced by Alexander Morton. His first appearance in the game is standing on a gallows platform in Flotsam during Chapter I. He is saved from being hanged (His crime? Colluding with the Scoia'tael) alongside another friend of Geralt's - Dandelion (himself accused of debauchery, or maybe setting fire to a tower, or possibly both!).
Since they saw each other last, Zoltan's engagement to Eudora Breckenriggs has fallen through, as has his career in the mining industry, so he's settled for life as a "simple merchant", and occasional jewelsmith for a certain sorceress.
After Flotsam, he heads to Vergen where he is reunited with his old pals, Yarpen Zigrin and Sheldon Skaggs.
"The dwarf Zoltan Chivay is a close friend of Geralt's and mine, met while we were sneaking through the forests and wilderness of Brugge and Sodden, when war raged all around and the hooves of Nilfgaardian cavalry thundered on the high roads. Like many of his kin, he later fought at Brenna in the Mahakam Volunteer Detachment, a unit that contributed greatly to the victory, although this fact is sadly ignored by most chronicles. After the war he wanted to start a business, and even thought about taking a wife, yet fate had things arranged a bit differently. Zoltan had proved his friendship to the witcher many times, eagerly standing at his side in any moment of need, disproving those who claim that each and every dwarf is a spiteful, aggressive son of a bitch, that they do nor care for human plight and that coexistence is impossible. I know many nonhumans and if anything stands in the way of coexistence, it is human ignorance, spite and ungratefulness."
"They say a dwarf would get himself hanged for a friend, but Zoltan was in my company on the scaffold for another reason. The local authorities had accused him of colluding with the Scoia'tael, and that is usually enough to earn one the main role in entertainment like a morning execution."
 "The charges that Zoltan had contacts with the Squirrels were not entirely baseless. Though he did not actively participate in military action, the dwarf knew the unit's leader, Iorveth, among others."
 "It was not surprising, really, that, having encountered the aforementioned human spite and ungratefulness at every step, Zoltan sympathized with the dwarven and elven freedom fighters. He was balanced in his views, however, and valued loyalty to old friends above all else."
 If Geralt chooses Roche's path:
 "Though it was not exactly Zoltan's cup of tea to visit Henselt's camp, a place where non-humans were at best treated with mistrust and disdain, he decided to go with us. Yet he felt rotten, knowing nearby his kin were preparing to repel the same Kaedweni we were visiting."
 "Everyone's patience has limits. Thus it should not be surprising that he eagerly took the chance to leave Henselt's camp and head to Vergen."
 "After the fall of Vergen the roads were flooded with refugees. On one such road outside Henselt's camp, I met Zoltan, who had luckily managed to flee safely. It is hard to remember the last time I was as happy as when I saw his bearded face. Zoltan and I kept each other company during that journey and we reached safety together. But that is a different story altogether."
 If Geralt chooses Iorveth's path:
 "Zoltan went with us to Vergen and, with enthusiasm worthy of his military past, began training the local militia that would soon see it's baptism of fire. Though it appeared they would have a hard time, Zoltan was ready to defend the cause he believed in, fighting at the side of elves and men."
 "Given an occasion to heave an axe in good company, Zoltan grabbed it faster than I can unlace a woman's corset – which is pretty fast, provided I'm sober. He followed Geralt without hesitation and proved his worth, showing that there's more to him than just a loud mouth."
 "Zoltan won great renown during the defense of Vergen, closing the gate and stopping King Henselt's retreat nearly single-handedly. Thus he sealed the victory over the Kaedweni army that memorable day."
 "Just as I did, Zoltan decided to remain in Vergen when Geralt and Iorveth chose to travel to Loc Muinne to complete the final chapter of this story. There was still much to do in the newly independent Pontar Valley, and the dwarf turned out to be the right sort to take up some of the responsibilities."
"The Witcher Battle Arena".
Zoltan Chivay was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA.
"Dwarven adventurer and close friend of Geralt of Rivia, Zoltan Chivay is an excellent warrior, who excels at close quarters combat. Zoltan is the perfect initiator, his skills allow him to quickly jump into the fray, as well as vacate battlefield hotspots when the situation becomes too intense. His passive skill allows him to deal 25% more damage to stunned enemies."
"Bull Rush is a skill that can be used in various situations. You can employ it both to initiate attacks and to run away from enemies. Zoltan rushes towards the enemies, lifting them up in the air and temporarily disabling them. Bull Rush also does damage, but its main purpose should always be immobilizing enemies, so your team can finish the job. If you want to deal the finishing blow, you can activate Whirling Dwarvish, Zoltan's main offensive skill. Upon activation, the dwarf begins to spin franticly dealing damage to opponents around him. As it's an AoE (or Area of Effect) attack, it's best used when there are multiple enemies around. The skill can be used while Zoltan is moving, so it's also a good idea to utilize it when entering or escaping combat."
"Worth it! is Zoltan's special skill. It allows him to leap forward and sends a brutal shockwave that deals damage and knocks back enemies caught within it. Use it wisely as it can be a powerful tool capable of inflicting damage upon entire groups of foes."
Hero Presentation.
Geralt meets Zoltan in Novigrad. Where he is throwing vagrants out of Dandelion's newly inherited tavern. Zoltan also wondering where Dandelion had disappeared to assisted Geralt and this lead them to Priscilla a Bard Dandelion was very close to. Upon discovering where Dandelion was and when he would be taken to Oxenfurt in a prison cart Zoltan organized an attack on it with several fellow Dwarves and Geralt.
 "A dwarf, a soldier of fortune, a veteran of the Battle of Brenna, an unassailable optimist, a committed altruist, a lover of rough drinks and rougher songs, a master gwent player and, above all, a dear and loyal friend to me and Geralt – ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Zoltan Chivay. We first became fast friends years ago, when Geralt and I ran into Zoltan and the band he was leading at the time across war-stricken Riverdell."
 "It proved our fate to cross paths many times after that, and we eventually became inseparable companions, sticking together through good and ill. At our tale's beginning Zoltan and I had gone into business together running a Novigrad tavern called the Rosemary and Thyme."
 "By saving me from the transport taking me to my doom Zoltan proved yet again he would never abandon a friend in need. In return, Zoltan soon found himself on the receiving end of an act of friendship. Suffering some financial difficulties, he had taken out a loan from one of the Novigrad mob bosses, and as a result had made many unfortunate enemies."
 "He planned to repay his debt by gathering a prize collection of gwent cards – a risky endeavor, given the cutthroat nature of Novigrad gwent circles at the time, and one that would have never worked without Geralt's help."
"Scroll 1: Mohawk, hearty laugh, fists like bread loaves, and – perched atop his shoulder – a uniquely foul-mouthed parrot. Zoltan Chivay was an adventurer, bouncer, and amateur bird trainer all in one. Truly, a dwarf like no other."
"Scroll 2: Zoltan felt a deep, burning desire to do good. However, sensible that dwarf he was, Zoltan knew that he alone could not change the world for the better. Instead, he chose to do good only for himself and his immediate surroundings."
"Scroll 3: Zoltan never hesitated to jump into the fire for his friends... Yet words such as "gods," "honor," and "fatherland" never made a strong impression on him or his motivations. To him they rang hollow, reminiscent of a mug drained of its ale."
"Scroll 4: Zoltan's position regarding the Scoia'tael could be considered ambivalent. The promise of a better, brighter tomorrow never quite convinced him. That said, he never passed on an opportunity to kick a racist arse or two."
"Chest 1: Though always itching for his next adventure, there was a time when Zoltan considered putting down roots. Unsurprisingly, a woman proved the cause – a lovely she-dwarf by name of Eudora Breckenriggs to be precise. It even went so far as a proposal, followed by a stormy engagement period... That is, until one day when Eudora's father served Zoltan a black stew, signifying an end to his hopes for marriage."
"Chest 2: Zoltan had an endless stream of novel ideas for enterprise: a foundry, a laundry, an inn, a jeweler's workshop... And one common thread connected them all – each ended with bankruptcy and a torrent of strongly worded letters from outraged investors. Yet no amount of fiascos could convince him to stop trying. Surely, his next venture would at last make him a wealthy dwarf..."
"Chest 3: Zoltan's closest friend was a certain Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount of Lettenhove, more commonly known as Dandelion – a celebrated poet of the North. Together, they concocted elaborate business schemes and reveled in drunken debauchery for weeks at a time... Getting themselves into a good deal of trouble along the way."

Vesemir was the oldest and most experienced witcher at Kaer Morhen in the 13th century who acted as a father figure to Geralt of Rivia and the other witchers. Like many of the other witchers, he spent each winter in the fortress and set out on the path when spring arrived.
He was one of the few members of the School of the Wolf to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. By the 1260s, he was the sole old witcher remaining; however, as he was only a fencing instructor, he didn't possess the knowledge necessary to create new mutagens in order to mutate more disciples into witchers.
Biography.
Considered among the oldest witchers remaining, Vesemir was born early enough to witness the construction of Kaer Morhen in the 11th century. His mentor and tutor was Barmin.
In the second half of the 12th century, Kaer Morhen was attacked by an enraged mob led by group of mages and priests. Vesemir survived, either not present in the keep during the pogrom or mistaken as dead by the mob as he lay unconscious among the corpses of his fellows. While the pogrom was condemned, the school never regained its full functionality.
After the massacre, the school was run by Grandmaster Rennes, with Vesemir as second in command: a fencing instructor and precept for the witcher trainees, replacing Varin. At some point, he met Visenna outside Kaer Morhen, a sorceress who decided to give her child, a young boy named Geralt, to train as a witcher. Vesemir became a father figure to Geralt, but treated all young witchers with harsh affection. Apart from participating in the school's life, Vesemir also took some witcher contracts. One of his famous deeds involved disenchanting the curse afflicting the "Swan of Poviss".
In 1217, during the celebration of Saovine, village of Fox Hollow in Toussaint was attacked by a horde of vampires led by Emiel Regis Rohellec Terzieff-Godefroy, a higher vampire. Along with the villagers led by Germain, Vesemir managed to kick the vampires out of the village. The witcher however, knew that their victory was only temporary and that the vampires would strike again once they healed their wounds. He commanded the peasants to the castle of Tesham Mutna, where Regis took shelter.
Although Vesemir was injured in the clash, the peasants managed to capture the vampire. After chopping Regis into pieces, they buried his remains as deep as possible. While the treatment was insufficient to kill the higher vampire, it was more than enough to convince Regis to stop drinking blood and attacking the villagers.
For some time, the School of the Wolf was funded by the monarchs of Kaedwen alongside the School of the Cat. Vesemir had to reluctantly cooperate with Guxart, the fencing master of the Cats. Originally not liking each other, the two grew to understand one another. The cooperation between the schools unfortunately had to cease, as the Cat Grandmaster Treyse and a group of students had secretly conspired with King Radowit II and the mage Astrogarus against the Wolves. A week before the planned tournament between the schools Vesemir and Guxart were put under arrest by king's men, thus spared from the massacre that occurred. During the tournament, King Radowit betrayed both Cats and Wolves ordering his soldiers to shoot them all, resolving both his budget problems and imagined threats to his power in a simple but effective way.
Both masters – or, technically, acting grandmasters since Treyse's and Rennes' deaths – were released some time later and allowed to rebuild the schools, on the condition that the royal money would be never given to them again and that the schools must operate alone and unfunded. The schools declined slowly, and the deaths of mage assistants and veteran witchers put a definite end to the Wolf School by the late 1230s or early 1240s, as children were no longer trained there after then.
During the winter of 1234, while fulfilling a contract in Oxenfurt, Vesemir briefly dated young lady Mignole. After noticing each other from afar, Vesemir received a secret letter from the woman inviting him. The two had a tryst, which was unfortunately interrupted by Mignole's father who'd learned of the affair. Vesemir fled, leaving his gambeson behind in the process, and had an arrest warrant for him put out by the father.
Even though the school ceased to function, Vesemir and other witchers used to spend winters at Kaer Morhen. He allowed some non-Wolf witchers such as Coën, but forbade the entrance for the renegades, as in case of Brehen, whose massacre at Iello was exceptional even amongst the other Cats.
Likely around 1242, Vesemir hosted Eskel's Surprise Child, Deidre Ademeyn, at the keep, which prompted a diplomatic conflict with her brother and King Henselt's vassal, Merwin Ademeyn: Deidre was first in line to the throne, which did not suit her brother well. Ultimately the princess left the castle, however not without leaving a disfiguring scar at Eskel's face.
Training Ciri.
Decades later, in or around 1265, Geralt brought his surprise child, Cirilla, princess of Cintra, to be trained as a witcher. Vesemir taught her about the different monsters and herbs, leaving the physical training to Geralt, Eskel, Lambert, and Coën. However, the witchers soon found out that Ciri was a source, as she entered into a trance when she accidentally drank white seagull. The third time, Ciri foretold the deaths of Geralt and Coën. The witchers then decided to summon an old friend, the sorceress Triss Merigold, to help Ciri, under the pretext that Vesemir's bones ached. Triss posed some conditions to the witchers as she made them see the errors in their ways of treating Ciri, and Vesemir accepted the conditions despite the initial protests of some of the witchers.
The griffin in White Orchard.
In May 1272, on the trail of Yennefer, Geralt and Vesemir rode to White Orchard, where at a ford they encountered a merchant being trapped by a royal griffin. While fighting it, the old witcher suffered deep clawing to the shoulder. After freeing the man, they rode into the village to the local inn, and the two spoke to the innkeeper, Elsa, while a tense atmosphere filled the tavern. After Geralt met Gaunter O'Dimm, he spoke to Vesemir and decided to go to the Nilfgaardian Garrison.
After getting some buckthorn to lure the beast, Geralt and Vesemir waited in a field hidden with bait set out, and after the griffin landed, Vesemir gave Geralt his crossbow that he had won gambling. After the beast was killed, and Geralt had handed in its trophy, he and his old master headed back to the inn, where they were violently attacked by some racists. Following their deaths, the two witchers were shunned and told to leave, where they encountered Yennefer and a Nilfgaardian escort outside the inn. Yennefer explained that Emperor Emhyr var Emreis had summoned Geralt to Vizima, so Vesemir decided that he would head north to Kaer Morhen.
Summoning Avallac'h.
Vesemir spent the next couple of weeks working at Kaer Morhen, patching crumbled walls, with Eskel and Lambert, until Yennefer showed up, preparing the witchers for Geralt and Uma's return to the keep, much to Vesemir's annoyance, as she showed little care for manners.
Once Geralt arrived, everyone set out to prepare for the Trial of the Grasses that was to be performed on Uma, who Vesemir looked after until the trail was ready, taking him to the mountains, where he noticed in moments of complete relaxation, he behaved differently. Vesemir then put him into a trance and Uma spoke in a different voice. They all met the following morning and Geralt brewed the The Decoctions of the Grasses and started the trial on Uma, which Vesemir helped with but hated watching, remembering the painful history of their school. He slept through the trial until the end, when Uma transformed into Avallac'h, an elven sage, who revealed that Ciri was on the Isle of Mists and Geralt needed to find her. He also told them that when they took Ciri from the isle, the Wild Hunt would be able find her immediately, so Vesemir suggested that Geralt bring Ciri to Kaer Morhen and they all face the Wild Hunt together. He planned to spend the time preparing the keep for the coming battle with Eskel and Lambert.
The Battle of Kaer Morhen.
After Geralt and Ciri returned via portal from the Isle of Mists, she was overjoyed to see Vesemir. Yennefer, Triss Merigold, Ciri, Geralt and Vesemir all discussed things and then headed into the main keep. On the way Vesemir discussed flammable gasses and patching up walls with Ermion. Then all the people that had turned up discussed battle plans in the main keep, with Vesemir suggesting that they brew potions in the laboratory and use tools to clear the rubble blocking access to the armory, and then he and Geralt finished it off by laying out the final plan.
After a couple of hours, the Wild Hunt attacked, and Vesemir fought them on the walls of the lowest courtyard of the keep, briefly arguing with Ciri because she had left the inner keep against orders. Becoming overwhelmed and with Imlerith's arrival, they decided to retreat to the main courtyard. The Wild Hunt quickly broke through the gate and froze Geralt while Ciri and Vesemir hid at the top of the courtyard. Trying to protect Ciri, Vesemir was attacked by Imlerith, who he stabbed through the leg. He then cut Eredin Bréacc Glas who dropped Ciri, so Vesemir used Aard to push her far away. Imlerith then jumped on him and started beating and choking him, while Eredin started trying to convince Ciri to join him, much to Vesemir's horror. He spoke to Ciri begging her to run before stabbing Imlerith in the side. Imlerith, enraged, broke his neck, ending the old witcher's life.
Legacy.
On the one year anniversary of his death, Ciri returned to Kaer Morhen. Recounting tales of her life story and drinking by a campfire in the shadow of the old keep, paying tribute and remembering her old friend and mentor.
"The Witcher".
In the game, Vesemir is one of the first people Geralt speaks to upon arrival at Kaer Morhen, and he is the one to guide the amnesiac through his first few uncertain steps around the keep. He also tells the witcher about skinning monsters, an extremely useful skill throughout the rest of the game. Of no less importance is the fact that he introduces the character of Berengar to the plot while filling our hero in on his forgotten past.
Vesemir features prominently in the prologue and can usually be found wandering around the main hall on the ground floor of Kaer Morhen, or in the basement in the laboratory.
"Vesemir is the oldest and most experienced witcher, possibly older than Kaer Morhen itself. He spends each winter in the fortress and sets off on the road when spring comes, just like all the other witchers. Despite his age, Vesemir is robust and lively. Many youngsters could envy him his health. An excellent fencer, he was the one who taught me swordsmanship."
"He has raised many witchers, including me. His disciples treat him like a father. Leo was probably the old witcher's last protégé — the boy's death shocked him."
"He was one of a few to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. He is well aware of the magnitude of the hatred some people feel for witchers."
"The Price of Neutrality" premium module.
In "The Price of Neutrality" premium module he is found just inside the walls of Kaer Morhen; more specifically, in the main courtyard. He can be found later near the ford closest to the camp.
"Vesemir is the eldest and most experienced witcher; in fact, he may be older than Kaer Morhen itself. He spends each winter at the fortress and, like the others, sets off on his Path when spring comes. Vesemir is robust and lively despite his age, and many youngsters could envy him his health. An excellent fencer, he taught me all I know about sword fighting."
"As one of the few who survived the assault on Kaer Morhen, he is well aware of the intense hatred some harbor for witchers."
Associated quest.
Vesemir returned in "The Witcher 3 "as a key character and was voiced by William Roberts once again. The game began with Geralt and his old mentor on the trail of Yennefer, the former having woken from a dream of Kaer Morhen. Whether or not they discussed the dream, Vesemir then requested to see Yennefer's letter, remarking that it smelt of lilacs and gooseberries, Yennefer's preferred perfume. Afterwards, they proceeded onto White Orchard to ask the townsfolk whether they've seen the sorceress in black. Both he and Geralt killed a Griffin in order to earn info regarding Yennefer's location. On their way back to the inn, they were greeted by Yennefer in person. There, Vesemir separated from Geralt, wanting to return to Kaer Morhen to hide its path from the Northern realms and the Empire of Nilfgaard as they waged war on one another.
Vesemir disappeared for the majority of the game until Geralt returned to Kaer Morhen with Yennefer, then Ciri, where a group of resistance fighters were formed to fend off the Wild Hunt. During the battle, the King of the Wild Hunt detonated a magical explosion that froze all opposition, where only Vesemir and Ciri were unscathed. Vesemir tried to retreat with Ciri in tow but was immediately confronted by Eredin and Imlerith, the king and the second in command of the Wild Hunt respectively. Vesemir fended them off until Imlerith disarmed him, Ciri was then ready to surrender herself to the Hunt in order to spare everyone involved. In a last-ditch effort, Vesemir stabbed Imlerith in the abdomen with a hidden dagger, causing the Aen Elle general to snap his neck, killing him. Distraught at this, Ciri unleashed her power in a massive soundwave of energy that forced the Hunt to retreat. After the battle, Vesemir was then given a funeral and honored as a hero against the Wild Hunt, Ciri took his Wolf medallion as a memento.
"Vesemir plays a key role in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. He is the oldest living witcher, the only one to survive the pogrom which decimated the Wolf School witchers a long time ago. No one knows exactly how old Vesemir is, but it is possible that he is older than the very stones of Kaer Morhen, the keep where witchers of the Wolf School were trained, among which he once served as a fencing instructor. His gray hair frames the creased, craggy face of an old man, leaving no doubt that he is a veteran witcher, one whose skill could still give a younger man a run for his money."
"Vesemir was the oldest living member of the Wolf School and most likely the oldest witcher of any school on the Continent."
"About as long in years as the ruins of Kaer Morhen themselves and eternally complaining about his creaky bones, this master of the witcher trade gave no thought to a well-deserved retirement. Gray, but still spry, he continued to ply the monster hunting trade into his golden years – effectively, too, as he'd seen more beasts than all his students put together."
"A harsh and demanding instructor in Geralt's youth, over the years he had become something of an adoptive father and mentor to the other witchers, always ready to help with sage advice and steady hands."
"In the spring of 1272, when our story begins, Vesemir had joined Geralt on his search for Yennefer, trekking with him through war-ravaged Temeria."
 "Vesemir always said no witcher had ever died in his own bed, so death in combat surely awaited him as well. Death's waiting ended on the mournful day when the Wild Hunt descended on Kaer Morhen in pursuit of Ciri. Vesemir gave his all to protect his former ward, whom he had always treated like an adopted granddaughter, and died a hero's death at the hands of Imlerith, the Hunt's cruel general."
Associated quests.
Vesemir is a young, inexperienced witcher, who was injured during an attempt to fulfill a contract. He is depicted as a pale young man with black shoulder-length hair and golden cat-like eyes. He wears a dark leather armor over a turquoise gambeson.
The player character finds him unconscious and brings him to a herbalist in Dol Tirthana. After waking up, Vesemir tells the player what happened and hands over the conctract he had failed to fulfill. Later, in the "Intruder", the player can ask Vesemir for help in defeating the monster and he gives them a special potion.
According to the glossary, Vesemir often points out the mistakes of both the witcher adepts' and their instructors', but he is convinced that he himself would not be suitable for a teacher.
"He stood casually leaning against a wall, staring gloomily at the boys and girls' clumsy movements. Their elbows drooped, and their hips jutted or were unstable. They couldn't get their center of gravity right, and their stances were too narrow."
""See that?" he growled, pointing at the master sitting to the side."Sitting on his ass, sharpening his sword. Those kids're just reinforcing their mistakes."
"You should be a fencing instructor yourself," replied the blonde witcher sitting beside him."
"Never. Don't got the patience nor the inclination. I'd be a terrible teacher."

Striga

A striga (Polish: "strzyga") is a human woman transformed into a monster by a curse. She is filled with hatred towards all living beings, devouring them without a second thought. She only comes out on a full moon to hunt, fighting with incredible speed and strength.
King Foltest would sometimes tie criminals up to stakes in the ground, who would serve as a meal for the beast.
Curse and transformation.
There is not much known about the curse that turns females into striga. The only well-documented example of a striga's lifetime was that of Adda the White, daughter of Foltest, king of Temeria. She was cursed prior to her birth, then born a striga. She and her mother, who did not survive the birth, were laid to rest in a single tomb. For seven years she grew inside the sarcophagus, only to emerge a creature of predatory instinct with the size and skill to carry it out.
Some details of the curse which transforms people into strigas are outlined in Ostrit's journal.
Lifting the curse.
In order to lift the curse on a striga, "someone must prevent the striga from returning to her coffin by the third crowing of the rooster. Then she would be cured, turning into an ordinary little girl".
Life After the Curse.
After a person has been cured from the striga-curse, there is the chance that the person will not fully recover mentally, keeping part of the vicious and somewhat dull-witted nature of her previous striga-form. However, there is also the implication that this is specific to Adda's case; being cursed before birth, she would have no exposure to humanity and thus had to learn speech, proper behavior, etc. at a much older age than normal.
There is also the chance of a relapse, turning back into a striga. To prevent this, "cured" strigas wear sapphire amulets (preferrably "with" an inclusion) and every now and then, juniper, broom and aspen should be burned in the fireplace of their chamber to ward off the curse.
"The Witcher".

 &lt;data source="info"&gt;&lt;label&gt;Additional Info&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
 &lt;/group&gt;
&lt;/infobox&gt;The striga is the first monster introduced in the opening cinematic sequence of the game. It depicts the tale of the night Geralt cured Adda's curse.
"Where does it come from? Spells, magic?"
"I have no idea, sire. The Sages research these phenomena. For us witchers, it is enough to know that strong will may create them. We also like to know how to fight them."
"And kill them?"
"Most frequently, yes. That is what we are usually paid for. Few want the spell lifted. People usually just want to be protected. If the monster has killed people, revenge may be another motive."
Monsterbook.
"Developer CD PROJEKT RED's characterization of the striga taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game "The Witcher" for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:"
Geralt of Rivia made his first appearance in a story titled simply "The Witcher". His task there was to lift the curse holding Princess Adda, who was born a striga. This seemingly simple story of a contract for a professional monster slayer proved to be a fascinating tale of jealousy and hatred. No wonder Geralt's literary debut served as the basis for the film that opens the game.
The striga also had to appear in the game itself. Initial ideas called for it to be the result of Salamandra's experiments, but we ultimately decided it would once more be Adda, possessed by a recurrence of the curse.
The concept for the striga follows faithfully its literary description. A foul, well-muscled monster, the cursed princess runs about on all fours. Her jaw extends from ear to ear, and her fingers end in claws capable of tearing a man to shreds. Her breasts and red hair are the sole reminders that the striga is, in fact, a young girl possessed by an evil curse.
In the cinematic that introduces the game, the striga is deadly, aggressive, and bursting with hatred. At one point the beast begins to fear Geralt and for a moment behaves not unlike a little girl. Presenting the storm of emotions with which the creature grapples would have been impossible without an array of animations and facial expressions.
Aside from the striga, there is also a stronger variant of the creature - the White Striga.

The Witcher decision checklist

"Do you really wish to know?" — Spoilers from the books and/or adaptations to follow!
This page covers the decisions you have to make during the game and how they impact on the further story.
Decision: Fight the Frightener or Save the Laboratory
Consequences:
* If you fight the frightener with Vesemir, he will give you a red meteorite ore when talking with him later. Near the end of Chapter I at the bridge, you will face some Salamandra with a mutant dog, and the cutscene that plays will be generally negative about your choice here.
* But if you choose to save the lab with Triss, you can loot a sapphire from Savolla's corpse. At the bridge in Chapter I, you will face the Salamandra only, no mutant dog, and the cutscene will be generally positive about your decision here.
Reference: Defending Kaer Morhen
Decision: Escort Vesna or not
Consequences:
* If you escort her, you get the option to rendezvous with her at the mill at night.
* If you do not help her, the bandits kill her.
Reference: She's No Early Bird
Decision: Help Zoltan
Consequences:
* If you do not help, you do not get any xp.
* If you do, you get xp and gratitude from Zoltan.
Reference: Racists
Decision: Give Arms to Scoia'tael (during Haren Brogg's quest)
Consequences:
* If you give the arms to the Scoia'tael, they will use those weapons to kill Coleman in Chapter II. This happens as soon as you go to The Hairy Bear Inn after speaking with the detective. (So if you intend to complete The Rat Quest, go to the inn before speaking with Raymond, which can be a bit tricky to avoid.)
* If you do not give the arms to the Scoia'tael, Golan Vivaldi will be sent to jail when you go to see him in Chapter II regarding the two books needed for the quest A Mysterious Tower. However, you can bail him out for 200 , then visit him at his home to obtain the books. The books cost 400 otherwise.
* Killing the Scoia'tael allows you to ask Haren Brogg about Hoog, Zoltan's Scoia'tael friend whom the dwarf had mentioned he was supposed to meet in the Outskirts, but you do not get any information out of it. One of the Scoia'tael also has four Beggartick blossoms on him.
Reference: Strangers in the Night
Decision: Fight Leo
Consequences:
* If you fight Leo, you can get a red meteorite ore off him.
* Two out of the three conversation paths lead to Leo's ghost appearing.
Reference: Dead Hand of the Past
Decision: Save Abigail or Side with Reverend, Odo and Haren
Consequences:
* If you save Abigail, she fights with you against the Beast. If she lives, you will meet her again in Chapter IV and she will also help you fight in the Epilogue.
* If you do not save her, she dies and you face the Beast with a bunch of villagers. But having sided with them, you will not have to fight them after the Beast encounter. Also, a generic healer will be in the healer's hut in Chapter IV and you will have to fight Abigail in the Epilogue.
Your choice in this decision alters the way in which The Heat of the Day quest in Chapter IV plays out as well because this decision impacts whether you are someone who stays out of other people's business or tries to help others by getting involved.
References: Of Monsters and Men, The Heat of the Day, Frozen Reflections
Decision: Fight alongside Siegfried or alone in the sewers
Consequences:
* Choosing to join forces with Siegfried will allow you into the dike with the minimum of trouble and the Order armourer will be willing to deal with you. There will be a generic guard at St. Lebioda's Hospital, and he will let you enter only if you have the City Guard signet ring or with a bribe of 30 .
* Choosing to kill the cockatrice alone will let you walk into the St. Lebioda's Hospital with the minimum of trouble. However, the Order armourer will not deal with you but the Dwarven blacksmith will if you helped the Scoia'tael. The guards at the gate to dike will let you enter only if you have the City Guard signet ring or with a one time bribe of 60 .
References: The Beast of the Sewers, Prison Break
Decision: Visit the detective right away or start the inquiry on your own.
Consequences: This is only relevant if you let the Scoia'tael take the supplies in Strangers in the Night. Coleman dies immediately after Geralt visits Raymond, which would prevent the player from starting The Rat quest (it is a minor side quest with zero plot impact).
* If you go to the Hairy Bear Inn before Raymond's house, you will find Coleman there still alive and if you follow through to complete The Rat quest before visiting Raymond you receive 600 orens and 2500 XP and Coleman is a source of fisstech.
* Putting off talking to Raymond for too long messes up quite a few more important quests... not necessarily catastrophically, but inconveniently.
References: The Rat, A Gravedigger's Gratitude, Anatomy of a Crime, , , , , , , Vizima Confidential, What Lies Beneath
Decision: Kill or spare Gramps for being the cannibal.
Consequences: 
* If you decide to kill Gramps you'll have to fight him and Echinops outside his house, but you'll get more XP
* If you spare the Gramps you'll get less XP, Azoth and Formula for Hanged Man's Venom.
References: The Cannibal
Decision: Side with the Scoia'tael or the Order, or remain neutral (refuse both).
Consequences:
* Before Force Recon your actions regarding Haren Brogg's crates in Chapter I may cause the dwarves not to deal with you.
* After Force Recon, whomever you choose, the other side is not too friendly with you back in town.
* If you choose the Scoia'tael, the order merchant/armourer will not interact with you.
* If you remain neutral (by not starting Force Recon) — your relationship with both the order merchant/armourer and the Scoia'tael blacksmith will effectively be reset and you will be able to interact with both of them until you progress farther into the story.
* Siegfried seems unaffected either way.
References: Force Recon, Strangers in the Night, Working Girls
Decision: Shani or Triss
Consequences:
* Seems to affect your romance subplot and the type of ending you may get. Whomever you do not choose, that person's second sex card will not be available to you.
* Whomever you do not choose will still be angry with you in Chapter V, but they will still help you/talk to you.
* Also, if you leave Alvin with Triss, in Chapter IV, Alvin will go to the ruins and you meet the Gambling Ghost.
* If you leave him with Shani, he goes to the riverbank and gets a dog.
* Whomever you choose will fight alongside you in the Epilogue.
References: The Source, Alvin
Decision: Thaler, live or die?
Consequences: If Geralt saves him, in their next conversation he exposes the royal edicts as fakes, and he will be in the Royal Castle in Chapter V.
"Spoiler Note in later games:" Even if Thaler dies, he'll re-appear in ', regardless of your choice. If you did save him, additionally in ' you'll get a package and a message from Thaler when you are in Flotsam.
References: All the King's Men, A Posh Reception, Dragon's Dream (bomb),
Decision: Side with vampiresses, Patrick or remain neutral.
Consequences:
* If you side with vampiresses, you'll have to kill Patrick and his knights. Blue-eyes lass will be grateful and stays in House of the Queen of the Night.
* If you side with Patrick, you'll have to kill all vampiresses and Blue-eyes lass will hate you. If you had sex with the vampiresses Patrick and his knights will show up to help. Either way, he will refuse to pay you.
*If you had sex with vampiresses and then decide to remain neutral, both parties will attack you.
References: Blue Eyes
Decision: Werewolf (kill, save/cure, save/not cure)
Consequences:
* If you spare the werewolf and cure him, when you enter The New Narakort to meet with Triss and Leuvaarden, Vincent will enter with a group of guards to fight the Salamandra with you.
* If you help Vincent, the novice nun will know about it in the Epilogue and praise you.
* If you spare the werewolf but do not cure him, Vincent will fight with you as a werewolf along with some guards.
* If you spare the werewolf and then proceed to complete the Beauty and the Beast quest, you get an additional 6000 XP (in total).
* If you kill the werewolf you get 1500 XP and Werewolf Fur, allowing you to create the Werewolf's Wrath potion and unlock the Predator ability; however, there is no possibility of completing the Beauty and the Beast quest.
* If you kill the werewolf, when you enter the inn, you are arrested for Vincent's murder and have to fight a bunch of City Guards and a single Salamandra informer.
* Killing Vincent will also replace him with another guard captain at the dike in Chapter V who will detain Dandelion, though this does not actually have an effect on anything.
* If you kill him, Carmen will be at the safe house as well and not very happy about the turn of events.
References: Beauty and the Beast, Lock and Key, The Unforgiven
Decision: Side with the Scoia'tael or Order at the Bank?
Consequences:
* If you side with Yaevinn, the Scoia'tael will fight with you during the battle with Azar Javed and the Professor.
* If you side with the Siegfried, the Order will fight with you during the battle.
Opposing a faction during Gold Rush will bar access to their associated path in Chapter IV (e.g. if you help Yaevinn escape the bank during Gold Rush, you may only choose the Scoia'tael or neutral paths in Chapter IV; likewise, helping the Order during Gold Rush will only permit choosing the Order or neutral paths in Chapter IV).
References: Gold Rush, Lock and Key, The Unforgiven
Decision: Side with Village, Vodyanoi or Compromise?
Consequences:
* If you side with the village, you get a large diamond from Julian as a reward.
* If you side with the Vodyanoi, the Friendly vodyan priest will reward you with a Ceremonial sword of Deithwen (which you can get from Scoia'tael remains just as easily in Chapter V, even if you are allied with them, as there is plenty of fighting in the streets).
* If you achieve a compromise, you receive the sword, Aerondight from the Lady of the Lake.
Reference: Ripples
Decision: Kill Berengar or spare his life?
Consequences:
* If you kill him, you get Berengar's medallion, Dagon Sap (Scroll), The Book of the Full Moon (formula for Shrike and Vampire oil) and 866 orens.
* If you do not kill him, you get Dagon Sap (Scroll) and The Book of the Full Moon (formula for Shrike and Vampire oil). He also shows up to help fight Azar Javed (although he is a very weak fighter).
References: Berengar's Secret, Sweet Revenge
Decision: Side with the Order, the Scoia'tael or remain neutral
Consequences:
* Order path: The Scoia'tael will be enemies in Chapter V, you will be asked to kill more Scoia'tael than White Rayla, to make the armor, you will need to see the Order Armorer and get Saint Gregory's litany. Siegfried will fight with you through Vizima in the epilogue. You will have to fight the ghost of Yaevinn in the epilogue. Sex card available is White Rayla's.

Toruviel aep Sihiel was a free elf from Dol Blathanna or the Blue Mountains. Originally a subject of Filavandrel, she became a Scoia'tael member and later joined the Vrihedd Brigade.
Biography.
Mission in the Valley.
Toruviel was part of the squad responsible for contacting Torque, a sylvan spying in Lower Posada for the elves to help them get food and learn agriculture. When their agent was endangered by the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who'd been hired to deal with the sylvan, she was among those who knocked out the witcher and the bard Dandelion and proceeded to tie them up.
When the two woke up, Toruviel began to berate the bard and beat him before breaking his lute. Enraged at this, Geralt provoked Toruviel to come closer and, despite being tied up, managed to headbutt the elf, breaking her nose. With that, Toruviel made to kill the witcher but lost control and broke down crying while the other elves proceeded to bandage her nose.
Later, after Dana Méadbh intervened and prevented Geralt and Dandelion's execution, the still-bandaged Toruviel gave Dandelion her own lute to replace the one she had destroyed.
Second Northern War.
When Scoia'tael units were formed to fight humans, Toruviel joined a commando together with Yaevinn and Cairbre aep Diared. In June 1267, while the three were on reconnaissance in the Pontar Valley, she kicked Yaevinn to wake him up after Cairbre noticed a lone rider on the road from Tretogor to Aedirn. Though Toruviel tried to discourage her comrade, stating one lone human wasn't worth the effort, Yaevinn shot the messenger, unaware that sparing his life would have prevented the provocation at Glevitzingen and the subsequent war.
Later, in early August, Toruviel and Ciaran aep Dearbh were wounded and guided by Milva to Col Serrai for healing. Not long after though, the two received news that Coinneach Dá Reo's commando was recruiting new elves and went to join him despite Milva's objections.
Toruviel and Yaevinn took part in the Battle of Brenna as members of the Vrihedd Brigade under Isengrim Faoiltiarna. At one point in the battle Menno Coehoorn ordered Vrihedd to strike at the point where Redanians under Kobus de Ruyter stood near the Temerians. Toruviel took part in the charge and was wounded in her arm by a 15 year old Redanian pikeman just before she cut his skull. She did not feel pain until the brigade breached the frontline and reached the tents and wagons. There, Yaevinn broke into Rusty's tent, murdering the wounded until he saw a Nilfgaardian. Toruviel called to him to retreat after Blenheim Blenckert's reinforcements arrived.
Healing among humans.
After the defeat at Brenna, a still wounded Toruviel and 7 other members of her commando fled. They spent some time in the forest, starving and pursued by White Rayla. During this time the "commando" met Lucienne's wagon with invalid Temerian veterans inside. Despite her comrades remarking to "keep dignity" and not look the humans in the eye, Tourviel did so and, while the veterans were initially scared of the elves, they handed food over to the broken elves before the commando continued to flee into the forests.
Later during the escape, Toruviel realized that the blood flow, fever, and fainting slowed their escape down. She left her bow, arrows, horse, and comrades and headed for one of the refugee camps they had encountered before. When she approached their campfire, she dropped her sword and asked for help after which she just fainted. Luckily, an old priestess of Melitele, Tammira, along with a young novice, prevented a hasty young bloke nicknamed "the Eye" from killing the elf on the spot and started to tend to her wounds.
In the morning the refugees decamped and got into their carts, taking Toruviel with them despite the Eye's protests. Toruviel was still far too weak and while she often napped thanks to Tammira's medicines, she had nightmares about slaughtered corpses around a temple ruin in the forest. Near the temple, she heard the voice of a divine being calling to her.
During one of the stopovers, one of the refugees was found dead, having been killed by a forest predator. While Toruviel suspected a wolf or wyvern, an old villager theorized that it must had been a shape-shifting dragon and speculated that dragons particularly like to take the form of elves. He eventually changed his mind later that night when the camp was attacked by leshens in the form of spiked wildcats and old men with xyloid arms. Toruviel and the refugees managed to repel the monsters, but a couple of humans died and most of the hens were eaten.
Toruviel, suspecting that the attacks could be connected with the deity-like being from her nightmares, asked Tammira to prepare a hallucinogenic decoction so that she could contact the being and localize it. After making contact, she suspected it to be some demon or a vampire wanting elven blood, and the refugees' leader sent her along with the novice (to tend to her wounds) and the Eye (to prevent her from escaping) to investigate the ruins shown to Toruviel by the unknown being. Before reaching their destination, the Eye became less belligerent towards her and even called her "a spunky chick".
The "being" turned out to be Aderill of the Golden Forests: an Aen Elle mage investigating the ruins with two henchmen. Using Elder Speech, he explained that five of the remaining seven members of Toruviel's commando were murdered there by humans, which activated the altar - an artifact which turned out to be a key to an Ard Gaeth, a Gates between worlds. Ideally, the portal should be fueled by elven blood, but humans' would do the job, so he had seized control over leshens to kidnap refugees and keep the portal open. He proposed Toruviel to go back with him so that she could be healed, and presented a vision of using the refugees' deaths to buy time for the Aen Seidhe to evacuate from the area. Toruviel objected, terrified and disgusted of the idea, explaining that all the elves from the area were killed at Brenna and spilling innocent blood would help no one. Aderill became incensed, suspecting her to have a delirium and stated the Ard Gaeth would turn the tide of the war with the Unicorns. However, before he could cast a spell to stun Toruviel and order his men to kill the Eye and the novice, Toruviel managed to throw a sword at him, preventing the mage from spellcasting, and the Eye killed the two remaining Aen Elle warriors with the novice's help. The fight weakened Toruviel and just before she fainted she asked her human companions to burn the bodies so that the portal would not activate again.
Toruviel did not die however, but awakened some time later, when the refugees reached their home village. Her arm was in better condition and Tammira said that the blokes destroyed the temple and the bodies were burned as she had asked. She called her "Tor" and promised that the villagers would hide her from White Rayla.
Return to Scoia'tael.
"For more information, see :#The Witcher."
Toruviel eventually returned to her warrior life and joined Yaevinn's new commando near Vizima.
Second Conjunction.
When the Second Conjunction began and the elves set sails west, Toruviel was not able to join the first wave - she had broken her leg in an accident. By the time she had fully recovered, most of the ships had departed for the Ard Gaeth in the sea, and only the last one waited for her near Cintra. Because she was pursued by so-called "Black Shrike", Toruviel disguised herself as a vagrant bard. In Cintra she met Dandelion with whom she talked of memories past and - at the end - slept. Unfortunately, the Catriona plague outbreak happened and the elven ship was not able to reach the port due to a quarantine. After dramatic events, she eventually met Dandelion again in the forest outside the city. Concluding that the ship would not return, she decided to form a musical duo with the bard.
"The Witcher".
Just like Yaevinn in the Swamp, Toruviel appears as the leader of a Scoia'tael group at the Lakeside. Unlike in the books, Toruviel is presented as being of lower (if only slightly) rank than Yaevinn. In the books, the reverse is true and the disparity in rank greater. According to White Rayla at the end of Chapter IV, Toruviel's 'full name' is "Toruviel Aep Shihiel".
Depending on which path Geralt follows, Toruviel is a possible sexual encounter and the conversation between the witcher and the elf, pre-encounter, is a lot of fun.
Note: This sex card can only be obtained if Geralt chooses the Scoia'tael path in the course of the game. It happens at the Scoia'tael hideout in Old Vizima.
"Toruviel leads a group of free elves who have fled persecution and ended up near Murky Waters. The elf is proud and bitter, though not as cynical as Yaevinn."
"White Rayla and her group reached Murky Waters in pursuit of the free elves. Toruviel took the inhabitants of the village hostage and demanded free passage for her people."
 Scoia'tael's path:
"I helped Toruviel in her fight against the knights of the Order who had been pursuing her. Thanks to my aid the non-humans defeated White Rayla's forces."
"The elf returned to Vizima to take part in Yaevinn's uprising and was killed in the street during the fighting."

&lt;/infobox&gt;
The Armor quest, which begins in Chapter IV, but also takes up most of Chapter V, is initiated when Geralt finds Berengar at the Lakeside crypt. The errant witcher tells our hero about a legendary suit of armor that once belonged to an equally legendary witcher named "Raven". Rumor has it, he was buried with his armor.
Walkthrough.
There are actually three variations on Raven's armor and depending on the path Geralt has chosen, the components of the armor vary slightly. All three require these first three basic components:
A fragment of Count Kobus de Ruyter's armor (Piece of armor) is found in the crypt at the lakeside when you first meet Berengar. It can also be found in Raven's Crypt.
The notes of an elven minstrel, found in a sarcophagus in the Striga's crypt on the island in the swamp cemetery. The official Enhanced Edition guide indicates that this is "in one of the sarcophagi in the crypt in the Fields", but this is incorrect and there is no Quest Tracking or quest marker for this item in Chapter 4.
The remains of Raven's Armor, in Raven's sarcophagus in Raven's crypt.
 Raven's armor of the Elves additionally requires:
 A bifunctional fiber and alloy recirculator, in a dwarven trunk, in the ancient crypt beneath the old mine in the swamp cemetery.
 Raven's armor of the Order additionally requires:
 Saint Gregory's litany, in a sarcophagus in the ancient crypt connected to the striga's crypt.
 Raven's armor, as made by Kalkstein, requires:
 A magic formula. It is found in Agnes of Glanville's trunk in her lair.
Phases.
Raven's Armor.
I'm intrigued by the story of the armor worn by the witcher named Raven. Berengar claims that it's in Raven's tomb, but no one knows where the witcher was buried. Berengar suggested I talk to the blacksmith and the elven craftsman. They know the legend, too.
The De Ruyter Dynasty.
They say the counts of the De Ruyter dynasty had suits of armor fashioned by gnome craftsmen. If I can find the tomb of one of the counts, I might be able to find a piece of their armor. "I need to find a piece of gnome-fashioned armor."
Pieces of Armor.
I found a piece of Graf Ruyter's armor. I still need what remains of Raven's armor and the notes of an elven minstrel. "I need to find the notes of an elven minstrel and what remains of Raven's armor."
Notes of the Elven Minstrel.
To fashion a truly magnificent suit of armor, I need the notes of an elven minstrel. I should be able to find these in the minstrel's tomb or in the tomb of one of his disciples. "I need to find the notes of an elven minstrel. I should search the crypts."
The Dwarven Blacksmith / The Armorer / Kalkstein.
Zoltan told me of a dwarven blacksmith who is supposedly hiding in Old Vizima. According to the dwarf, the blacksmith can reforge Raven's armor for me. "Zoltan directed me to a dwarven blacksmith who is said to be hiding in Old Vizima."
Rayla recommended a Viziman armorer who can reforge Raven's armor for me. "Rayla claims I should see an armorer who lives in Vizima."
Kalkstein the alchemist is said to be in Old Vizima. According to Triss, he knows a lot about metallurgy and can reforge Raven's armor for me. "I must see Kalkstein the alchemist, who is said to be in Old Vizima."
A Mission from a Dwarf / an Armorer / Kalkstein.
I must bring the dwarf blacksmith all he needs to forge my suit of armor. I should look for the elements in the crypts in the swamp cemetery. "I'll find all the components for my armor in the crypts in the swamp cemetery."

I've found the remains of Raven's armor, a piece of Graf Ruyter's armor, and the notes of the elven minstrel. Now I need the final element required to forge the suit of armor. "All I need now is the bifunctional fiber and alloy recirculator." (1000 XP)
I've found the remains of Raven's armor, a piece of Graf Ruyter's armor, and the notes of the elven minstrel. Now I need the final element required to forge the suit of armor. "All I need now is Saint Gregory's Litany." (1000 XP)
I've found the remains of Raven's armor, a piece of Graf Ruyter's armor, and the notes of the elven minstrel. Now I need the final element required to forge the suit of armor. "All I need now is the magic formula." (1000 XP)

I gave all the elements to the armorer. I should see him later to pick up my suit of armor. "I should come back later to pick up my armor."
I gave Kalkstein all the elements. I should see him later to pick up my suit of armor. "I should come back later to pick up my armor. "Note: Even though Kalkstein says that it will take until "tomorrow", you can just leave his place and re-enter and the armor is finished. Apparently he has either a very short day or is an extremely gifted craftsman, maybe both.
A New Suit of Armor.
Finally, I have a magnificent new suit of armor. "I have my new armor - at last." (5000 XP)
Failed.
I've lost my chance at that armor.

A Magic Formula is a quest in "The Witcher", received in Chapter V if Geralt chooses the Witcher / neutral path, sends the witcher to the southernmost reaches of the swamp cemetery, to a refugee cave where he must retrieve a magical formula from an ancient crypt to help Kalkstein re-create Raven's armor.
Walkthrough.
After finding out that Kalkstein can indeed craft armor, given the right components, Geralt heads on out to the southernmost refugee cave in the swamp cemetery where the alchemist has told him he will find a Wayfarer's stone permitting entry to an ancient crypt. This cave also happens to be the very cave where Zdenek, the most famous fist fighter in history lives (pretty humble accommodations!).
To gain entry to Agnes of Glanville's lair, Geralt must use a specific combination of signs which he has conveniently given by Kalstein: Aard, then Igni, then Aard again to activate the stone, and poof! He is in.
Once inside, he is greeted by alghouls, fleders, cemetaurs and basilisks in this, the largest of the three Ancient crypts. After battling his way through to Agnes' primary chambers, he will find a chest with the magic formula that Kalkstein has requested. Then it is back to the alchemist with the formula.
Phases.
Elements of the Armor.
Kalkstein told me to bring him the pieces of both Raven's armor and the armor of a knight of the De Ruyter dynasty, the notes of an elven minstrel, and Agnes of Glanville's magic formula. I'll find all these items in the swamp cemetery. I can access the sorceress' underground laboratory through a cave where some refugees have found shelter. Once inside, I need to find a stone sensitive to magic. A combination of Aard, Igni, and Aard Signs will open the passage. "I must go to the swamp cemetery and find all the elements required to make the armor."
Success.
I have the magic formula. I need to deliver it and the other items needed for the armor to Kalkstein. "I need to deliver the magic formula and the other items to Kalkstein." (9000 XP)

Country Inn

The Country Inn is located just outside the village of Murky Waters. It is a family run business. The two innkeepers are husband and wife, and their daughter is the waitress. The husband holds the keys to the storage, but both he and his wife can offer accommodation. He will charge you 7 for a place to rest your weary bones while she asks only the usual 5 ; but as usual this option is irrelevant as there are enough free resting points around. Their daughter serves the alcohol and food.
The Innkeeper is also a source of local information and folklore. He can tell the tale of a certain princess, who is also a witcher and sorceress. His wife will gladly provide her own opinions about the Underwater City, the vodyanoi and the ancestors of the people of Murky Waters, giving Geralt valuable journal entries.
Also in residence at the Inn for the duration of Chapter IV are Dandelion and Julian. They sleep in the same room as the round-the-clock fistfighting. How do they do it?
Amenities.
You can always find:
"Tired travelers are drawn to the inn by the smell of fried bacon, boiled cabbage and sometimes even the famous wyvern egg omelets. A soothsayer inhabits the small hut nestled on the side of the tavern."

The Royal Palace in Vizima is a castle that once served as the seat of power for Temeria's King Foltest and his court. It was built after the abandonment of the previous seat of Temerian monarchs due to problems with a striga.
"The Witcher".
Journal entry.
"The castle was completed around the time when King Foltest's previous seat was taken over by a striga, the product of the ruler's incestuous affair with his own sister. Spacious stone halls, stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings indicate that dwarven engineering was employed here. King Foltest is a very active ruler and often travels, though when in Vizima he usually occupies his chambers and generally remains at the castle with his modest court. In the throne room, the King grants audiences to his subjects, be they petitioners or trusted advisors."
The Royal Palace is a region in the third game but limited to one location, the interior of the palace itself and the current Emperor of Nilfgaard, Emhyr var Emreis, who now occupies it. The courtyard has a secret room containing an old letter.

Black Tern Island

Black Tern Island is a picturesque island which rises unexpectedly out of the lake. This is where the chosen few can meet with the Lady of the Lake. The small strip of land, overgrown with trees, is also haven for hundreds of animals. The degenerate vodyanoi have built an altar there from stones extracted from the deep. They use the shrine to offer bloody sacrifices to Dagon.
There is also one circle of elements, the Circle of the Last Drop.

Vizima dungeon

"The dungeon is where those criminals unlucky enough to fall into the hands of the City Guard are kept. Prisoner turnover in the jail is relatively high. Some are released, usually to return after a while, while others are executed on the scaffold. Captain Vincent Meis of the City Guard is the jail's warden. His assistant is the jailer, Jethro. The dungeon affords access to the sewers, which run under the entire city of Vizima."
There are two cells. The first, a large holding area with many (apparently political) prisoners, and the second, a more private cell, where the Professor is initially locked up. There is also a secure area where prisoner effects are kept during their period of incarceration. This is where Geralt can pick up his gear after his first excursion through the sewers. There is also a large central area where the jailers perform their duties, a grate in the middle of the floor leads to the sewers.
It is also the scene of Geralt's third official fistfight (second if you missed the tutorial with Eskel). He must fight the loudmouth in the dungeon for the "privilege" of taking on the cockatrice which is currently stalking the sewers, securing his freedom from incarceration.

The dungeon also features in the "Side Effects" premium module.

The Shaggy Bear

The Shaggy Bear is a Viziman inn and a favorite hangout of the Mahakam Volunteer Army. "Fixtures" there include Zoltan Chivay, Dennis Cranmer, Yarpen Zigrin, Sheldon Skaggs and Jarre. Many a dispute relating to promotions and the like was settled over a few mugs. It is also a favorite hangout of the Vizima underworld. Many rumors circulate about the beer there — in particular, that the beer is made from dog urine.
"The Witcher".
"The Hairy Bear Inn is located in the southernmost corner of the slums in the Temple Quarter. It is just kitty corner from the Eager Thighs brothel, and if you lack the orens for a proper room, there is a conveniently located campfire just outside."
"The Hairy Bear is the place for indiscriminate clientèle. The innkeeper obviously holds back on the lye, though he waters down the ale generously enough. Patrons share the thin mattresses with rats, but most everyone can find their entertainment of choice here. Illegal fistfight enthusiasts, hustlers and drunkards will all find something to do at the Hairy Bear."
"It is said that you can even buy the illegal drug fisstech here, provided you can find a dealer named Coleman."

House of the Queen of the Night

House of the Queen of the Night is considered the finest brothel in Vizima and is in the Trade Quarter. All the local politicians and courtiers can be found there in the evenings enjoying the company of the many lovely ladies found there. The madame of this brothel is the Queen of the Night herself and her staff of lovelies offers much more than meets the eye.
"For people who can't complain about the lightness of their purses, Vizima's Trade Quarter offers entertainment of the highest quality. The most beautiful women await their clients at the House of the Queen of the Night. They offer refined pleasures and a chance to forget about the dreariness of daily life."

Old manor island

Old manor island is located in the middle of Lake Vizima and where the old manor house was located. Once one of the most splendid places in the capital city, it was abandoned in 1245 when the ostensibly dead Princess Adda returned to life as a bloodthirsty striga.
History.
Although the problem was solved by the witcher Geralt of Rivia, the place is still forgotten and everything seems to indicate that it has become a hideout and base of operations for the Salamandra.
These days the name "old manor" refers to the whole island, not just the manor which is located here.

The both the innkeeper and the waitress at the New Narakort are fountains of information, given the right incentive. The waitress is generally friendly, if busy and one need only chat her up a few times to learn something new. The innkeeper needs cold, hard cash to loosen his lips, but it is worth a few rounds.

Temple Quarter

The uprising of the non-humans has changed the Temple Quarter of Vizima beyond recognition. Fires rage everywhere and some streets are blocked by makeshift barricades. In many places the Scoia'tael clash with the Temerian army and knights of the Order. Many of the inhabitants have fled to the swamps, others hide in cellars and houses, praying for a quick end to the rioting. All kinds of missionaries and evangelists are taking advantage of the situation, preaching about divine wrath and the imminent end of the world.
"The Temple Quarter of Vizima is strangely reminiscent of a quarrelsome, dirty prostitute, who — despite her disagreeable appearance and personality — remains somehow alluring. This may be because of the uncomplicated, illicit entertainment it offers — always a temptation. Beggars, shady characters, scowling poor folk, frustrated nonhumans and, of course, "ladies" occupy every corner. Recently, Vizima's Temple Quarter was cut off from the rest of the world by the threat of an epidemic. The few City Guard patrols that come here try not to venture too far into the quarter's dark alleys, where brutal deeds take place each night. At the center of Vizima's Temple Quarter stands St. Lebioda's Hospital (previously a temple of Melitele), the only place of solace for the poor and plague victims. Alongside the hospital stand the headquarters of the Order of the Flaming Rose, which tries to combat local crime and the monsters creeping in from the sewers and the cemetery."
