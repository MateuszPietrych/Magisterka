   Geralt choice: Caranthir - tell me about him.   
   Geralt: Tell me something more about Caranthir. Know him well?
   Avallach: Know him? I reared him.
   Geralt: Raised, don't you mean?
   Avallach: No, Geralt. I began shaping him long before he was born.
   Avallach: For centuries I… brought together pairs of elves manifesting certain abilities - those able to manipulate time and space. He is the result of these efforts. Caranthir, a golden child.
   Avallach: Golden child who grew up to be a criminal.
   Geralt choice: Why're you helping Ciri?
   Geralt: You imprisoned Ciri the first time you met her. Now you protect her while fighting against your own kind. Quite an about-face.
   Avallach: First of all, I did not imprison her. She found me. It was her destiny.
   Geralt: Yeah, sure. Get to the "second of all." Why're you helping her?
   Avallach: Because she is a danger. A mortal one.
   Avallach: You look at her and see a human, a ward, a daughter, even. I look and see the Elder Blood - a power that can destroy the world, a power that must be kept from Eredin's power-addled hands at all costs.
   Avallach: Admittedly, our motives differ. Yet in spite of that we share a goal. So you would be wise to trust me… or at least try.
