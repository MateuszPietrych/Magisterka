Geralt: Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Nilfgaardian Officer: A vatt'ghern - this explains why I did not hear your footsteps. What do you seek here?
Geralt: Yennefer of Vengerberg. Where was she headed?
Nilfgaardian Officer: That is a military secret.
Geralt: Haven't thrown me out yet. Haven't called the guards. So go ahead - what's your price?
Nilfgaardian Officer: There is a griffin in the area. Slay it, and then I shall see what I can do.
Geralt: It's a deal. Some questions before I start. Know where the griffin has its lair?
Nilfgaardian Officer: It kept to the Vulpine Woods at first. I sent a patrol there, five young men. A hunter found them two days on. I only recognized them because they wore our plate.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Since then, the griffin has grown bold. Attacks in villages, fields, on the main road.
Geralt: Meaning it's abandoned its lair. Gonna have to set a trap.
Nilfgaardian Officer: I judge from your tone this will not be easy. What do you require?
Geralt: I'll need bait, a specific herb - buckthorn. Scent should lure the griffin from ten miles off.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Buck… buckthorn? I do not know this. But I am not yet fluent in the Common tongue.
Geralt: Mhm. Probably mastered the basics, though - "hands up," "kill them"…
Nilfgaardian Officer: No. First came idioms. "Don't play with fire," for example.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Go to Tomira, an herbalist. She lives near the crossroads. She will aid you.

Geralt: I'm looking for someone. A sorceress. Yennefer of Vengerberg. Have you seen her?
Nilfgaardian Officer: You're not the first to ask. She passed through. Headed north in haste, escorted by a rider from our intelligence corps. But information has a price.
Geralt: I don’t barter in coin.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Good. I need something else. A griffin has made its nest in the hills beyond the forest. It’s killing our patrols, tearing through supply lines. Slay it, and I’ll give you what you want.
Geralt: Griffin nests don’t just appear. Something drove it here.
Nilfgaardian Officer: No doubt. Locals say it nested in the ruins by the old watchtower. We’ve found soldiers... or what was left of them. Wings severed, entrails strung from trees. It’s hungry, and it’s angry.
Geralt: I’ll need to lay a trap. Bait it out. Buckthorn ought to do the trick.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Then speak to Tomira, the herbalist in the village. She knows the area—and the plants. Help us, witcher, and I’ll ensure your path to Yennefer is cleared.
Geralt: Fine. I’ll handle your griffin. But when it’s done, I expect truth, not riddles.
Nilfgaardian Officer: You’ll get what you came for. On my honor.

--GAME--
Geralt: Looking for a woman.
Gaunter: Ahh, like everyone.
Geralt: Not like everyone, and not just any woman. Mine smells of lilac and gooseberries, dresses in black and white.
Gaunter: Two schnappses!
Gaunter: Hah. It'll lift your spirits.
Geralt: Fine, I'll have a drink.
Geralt: Can we cut to the chase? You seen her or not?
Gaunter: Yennefer of Vengerberg?
Geralt: Never mentioned her name.
Gaunter: Yet you described her perfectly. And once I hear something, I never forget. Can't help it.
Geralt: You seen Yennefer?
Gaunter: Deepest apologies, but I must ask: Is this about love?
Geralt: None of your business.
Gaunter: Yes, as a vagrant I deserve no explanation.
Geralt: What do you know? Tell me.
Gaunter: Before you appeared, it never occurred to me that might've been Yennefer. Who would've have thought…
Geralt: Get to the point.
Gaunter: A Nilfgaardian scout from the local garrison saw her.
Geralt: Where?
Gaunter: At their camp. She rode in there - dark of night, black and white, gooseberries and… yes, I know. Had a terse exchange with the garrison commander and raced off.
Geralt: Where to?
Gaunter: I'm not omniscient. Ask at the garrison.
Geralt: Thanks.
Gaunter: We men of the road must stick together. Perhaps one day I'll be in trouble and you'll be nearby to help.

Summary: Geralt is looking for Yennefer and encounters Gaunter, who offers to help. Gaunter mentions that a 
  Nilfgaardian scout saw Yennefer at their camp, where she had a brief conversation with the garrison commander before leaving. 
  Geralt is advised to ask at the garrison for more information. Gaunter expresses that witcher maybe help him in the future.

--LLM--
Gaunter: You look lost, witcher. Or... perhaps you're chasing someone?
Geralt: Not lost. Just tracking someone who doesn’t want to be found.
Gaunter: A sorceress, perhaps? Raven hair, violet eyes? Yennefer of Vengerberg?
Geralt: You know her?
Gaunter: I've seen things, heard whispers. One of Nilfgaard's scouts spotted her not far from here. Rode into their camp, exchanged words with the garrison commander, then vanished like mist at sunrise.
Geralt: You saw this yourself?
Gaunter: Not with these eyes, no. But my... acquaintances hear much. You’d do well to ask at the garrison. The commander may be more forthcoming if approached by someone of your... persuasion.
Geralt: You’re being helpful. That makes me suspicious.
Gaunter: Call it... an investment. I have a feeling our paths will cross again. And when they do, I may ask something of you in return.
Geralt: I don’t make deals in the dark.
Gaunter: You don’t have to. Not yet.
Geralt: Fine. I’ll speak to the Nilfgaardians. But if this is a trick—
Gaunter: No tricks, witcher. Just opportunity. Until next time.
