Geralt: Geralt of Rivia. Witcher.
Nilfgaardian Officer: A vatt'ghern - this explains why I did not hear your footsteps. What do you seek here?
Geralt: Yennefer of Vengerberg. Where was she headed?
Nilfgaardian Officer: That is a military secret.
Geralt: Haven't thrown me out yet. Haven't called the guards. So go ahead - what's your price?
Nilfgaardian Officer: There is a griffin in the area. Slay it, and then I shall see what I can do.
Geralt: It's a deal. Some questions before I start. Know where the griffin has its lair?
Nilfgaardian Officer: It kept to the Vulpine Woods at first. I sent a patrol there, five young men. A hunter found them two days on. I only recognized them because they wore our plate.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Since then, the griffin has grown bold. Attacks in villages, fields, on the main road.
Geralt: Meaning it's abandoned its lair. Gonna have to set a trap.
Nilfgaardian Officer: I judge from your tone this will not be easy. What do you require?
Geralt: I'll need bait, a specific herb - buckthorn. Scent should lure the griffin from ten miles off.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Buck… buckthorn? I do not know this. But I am not yet fluent in the Common tongue.
Geralt: Mhm. Probably mastered the basics, though - "hands up," "kill them"…
Nilfgaardian Officer: No. First came idioms. "Don't play with fire," for example.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Go to Tomira, an herbalist. She lives near the crossroads. She will aid you.

--LLM--
Geralt: I'm looking for someone. A sorceress. Yennefer of Vengerberg. Have you seen her?
Nilfgaardian Officer: You're not the first to ask. She passed through. Headed north in haste, escorted by a rider from our intelligence corps. But information has a price.
Geralt: I don’t barter in coin.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Good. I need something else. A griffin has made its nest in the hills beyond the forest. It’s killing our patrols, tearing through supply lines. Slay it, and I’ll give you what you want.
Geralt: Griffin nests don’t just appear. Something drove it here.
Nilfgaardian Officer: No doubt. Locals say it nested in the ruins by the old watchtower. We’ve found soldiers... or what was left of them. Wings severed, entrails strung from trees. It’s hungry, and it’s angry.
Geralt: I’ll need to lay a trap. Bait it out. Buckthorn ought to do the trick.
Nilfgaardian Officer: Then speak to Tomira, the herbalist in the village. She knows the area—and the plants. Help us, witcher, and I’ll ensure your path to Yennefer is cleared.
Geralt: Fine. I’ll handle your griffin. But when it’s done, I expect truth, not riddles.
Nilfgaardian Officer: You’ll get what you came for. On my honor.

--GAME--
Geralt: Looking for a woman.
Gaunter: Ahh, like everyone.
Geralt: Not like everyone, and not just any woman. Mine smells of lilac and gooseberries, dresses in black and white.
Gaunter: Two schnappses!
Gaunter: Hah. It'll lift your spirits.
Geralt: Fine, I'll have a drink.
Geralt: Can we cut to the chase? You seen her or not?
Gaunter: Yennefer of Vengerberg?
Geralt: Never mentioned her name.
Gaunter: Yet you described her perfectly. And once I hear something, I never forget. Can't help it.
Geralt: You seen Yennefer?
Gaunter: Deepest apologies, but I must ask: Is this about love?
Geralt: None of your business.
Gaunter: Yes, as a vagrant I deserve no explanation.
Geralt: What do you know? Tell me.
Gaunter: Before you appeared, it never occurred to me that might've been Yennefer. Who would've have thought…
Geralt: Get to the point.
Gaunter: A Nilfgaardian scout from the local garrison saw her.
Geralt: Where?
Gaunter: At their camp. She rode in there - dark of night, black and white, gooseberries and… yes, I know. Had a terse exchange with the garrison commander and raced off.
Geralt: Where to?
Gaunter: I'm not omniscient. Ask at the garrison.
Geralt: Thanks.
Gaunter: We men of the road must stick together. Perhaps one day I'll be in trouble and you'll be nearby to help.

Summary: Geralt is looking for Yennefer and encounters Gaunter, who offers to help. Gaunter mentions that a 
  Nilfgaardian scout saw Yennefer at their camp, where she had a brief conversation with the garrison commander before leaving. 
  Geralt is advised to ask at the garrison for more information. Gaunter expresses that witcher maybe help him in the future.

--LLM--
Gaunter: You look lost, witcher. Or... perhaps you're chasing someone?
Geralt: Not lost. Just tracking someone who doesn’t want to be found.
Gaunter: A sorceress, perhaps? Raven hair, violet eyes? Yennefer of Vengerberg?
Geralt: You know her?
Gaunter: I've seen things, heard whispers. One of Nilfgaard's scouts spotted her not far from here. Rode into their camp, exchanged words with the garrison commander, then vanished like mist at sunrise.
Geralt: You saw this yourself?
Gaunter: Not with these eyes, no. But my... acquaintances hear much. You’d do well to ask at the garrison. The commander may be more forthcoming if approached by someone of your... persuasion.
Geralt: You’re being helpful. That makes me suspicious.
Gaunter: Call it... an investment. I have a feeling our paths will cross again. And when they do, I may ask something of you in return.
Geralt: I don’t make deals in the dark.
Gaunter: You don’t have to. Not yet.
Geralt: Fine. I’ll speak to the Nilfgaardians. But if this is a trick—
Gaunter: No tricks, witcher. Just opportunity. Until next time.










Cerys: Udalryk…
Udalryk: Begone, lass.
Cerys: I'd never let your babe be hurt. You know that.
Udalryk: Yet you almost killed 'im!
Cerys: It was a trick. We wanted to cheat the creature that haunts you.
Cerys: Not a hair on the tyke's head would've been harmed.
Cerys: There's a door the other side. I'd 'ave pulled the little one from the oven right away, no flames would've touched 'im.
Cerys: The hym would've thought Geralt killed the child. He'd 'ave abandoned you for the witcher.
Cerys: But when he saw your son safe and sound, he'd 'ave had to go.
Udalryk: Argh…
Udalryk: What you did… It's hard to believe any good could've come of it.
Udalryk: On the other hand, I've known you since you were a child… You're Crach's daughter.
Udalryk: I know you've never harmed another mindfully…
Udalryk: Argh, let's leave it be, leave it be.


Geralt: Been thinking… We gonna swim across the pond?
Lambert: No, I got a boat moored there. You know, for fishing.
Geralt: Wow… Never took you for the fishing type.
Lambert: I use bombs. Drop 'em in, then scoop up whatever floats to the surface.
Geralt: Hm. That makes sense.
Lambert: Uh-oh. Looks like someone beat us to it.
Lambert: Dammit… Gonna chain that boat down next time.
Geralt: Stop talking and listen.
Geralt: Make this boat yourself?
Lambert: Yeah. Something you don't like about it?
Geralt: Besides the water up to our ankles? Nothing.
Lambert: Quit whining… It'll make it across the lake.
Geralt: Provided we don't smash into something first. Barely see the tip of my nose.
Geralt: Fog's thick as curdled milk…
Lambert: Never took you for a poet.
Geralt: Oh, but I am one. Wanna hear a limerick?
Lambert: Sure.
Geralt: Lambert, Lambert - what a prick.
Lambert: Not bad.



Cirilla: I barely escaped the Crones. And then there was the baron.
Cirilla: You know he took me hunting? I killed a wild boar with my sword.
Geralt: I heard.
Cirilla: A coincidence, really. I had no desire to hunt that day, but it felt wrong to refuse.
Cirilla: I'd taken nothing remotely resembling a hunting weapon. I simply hadn't intended to hunt.
Cirilla: I was wandering through the forest, breathing deep the air, and then I heard a strange sound, unsettling.
Geralt: Boar attacked you?
Cirilla: Mhm. Big as a bison and lumbering straight at me. And all I had was my sword. Had to manage.
Geralt: Did just fine judging by how the baron's men remember it.
Cirilla: Simple soldiers, the whole lot, but we got along splendidly. A shame I had to leave, flee, but I didn't want to bring the Wild Hunt down on them.




Geralt: Finally know where Ciri is.
Triss: Really? That's... wonderful!
Triss: Wait, why haven't you brought her here? Is she in danger?
Geralt: Guessed it. As soon as I reach her, the Wild Hunt'll know.
Geralt: I need you to go to Kaer Morhen. As soon as I have Ciri, I'll take here there - we'll face the Hunt together.
Triss: Geralt… You know I'd do anything for Ciri… But we'll need to evacuate the mages from the city any day now.
Triss: They're counting on me, I can't leave them.
Geralt: I understand…
Triss: Maybe we can make this work. If you helped me, we'd speed things up, considerably… Think about it and let me know.





Skellige Warrior 02: Ah sooner expect the white whale than the Black Ones' ships.
Skellige Warrior 03: Folk say the emperor commands a fleet twice the size of ours.
Skellige Warrior 01: And if they said he had a tail, would you believe that?
Skellige Warrior 03: Not concerned with what grows out his arse. I only care whether in a year's time we'll all be sittin' in a fortress eatin' rats.
Skellige Warrior 03: Those fucks on Faroe'll faint soon as they see the imperial sun.
Skellige Warrior 04: Heheh. Be kickin' themselves when they wake on seein' us with most of the booty.
Skellige Warrior 05: Be the first raid where the Black Ones deliver the goods to our doorstep.
Skellige Warrior 05: It's like a sheep grindin' 'gainst the shears for ye.
Skellige Warrior 04: Hm, I could use a fine Viroledan for me Madds. My blade's too heavy for the lad.


Skellige Warrior 1: "To the waves that guard our shores! And may the Nilfgaardian dogs drown before they land!"
Skellige Warrior 2: "Aye, but have you heard? They're claiming more lands down south. Like a bloody plague, spreading their black banners."
Skellige Warrior 3: "Let them come. We'll break their bones on the cliffs and feed their corpses to the gulls."
Skellige Warrior 4: "Easy to boast when they’re not here. But what if they do come? The mainland's trembling, says Hjalmar. Even Kaedwen’s bending the knee."
Skellige Warrior 1: "Let the mainlanders cower. We’re Skelligers. No Nilfgaardian iron will tame our waves or our steel."
Skellige Warrior 2: "True enough. But I heard tales from a trader. Says the Black Ones have ships now, bigger than ours, faster even."
Skellige Warrior 3: "Ships or not, they can’t fight the winds. Or the storms we’ll call down on them."
Skellige Warrior 4: "But what of our alliances? If the jarls don’t unite, we’ll be as scattered as broken mastwood."
Skellige Warrior 1: "Then we fight as we’ve always done. For honor, for Skellige. Let the mainlanders bow, but never us."
Skellige Warrior 2: "If only the gods would sink their fleet before it reaches our shores..."



Guslar: Ask a service of the witcher, the pellar must. A witcherly service, that's to say…
Geralt: What do you need, tell me.
Guslar: A man who fears no evil, the pellar needs…
Guslar: Forefathers' Eve is nigh, we've rites to conduct. Wandering souls to emerge, damned souls, too. We've the circle to protect from these wretches.
Geralt: Seems like you could use a witcher - so, yeah, I'll help.
Guslar: You'd not refuse, the pellar knew. The time's come to gather the folk.
Guslar: Across the lake, we must journey - to Fyke Isle. There, in the circle of stones, we shall meet.
Geralt: The sooner we resolve this, the better. Best do it tonight, at midnight.



Pellar: "You... you’re the witcher, aye? The one who dealt with the wraiths in Blackbark Woods?"
Witcher: "That’s me. What do you need?"
Pellar: "Ritual. Needs guarding. Spirits... restless. Angry."
Witcher: "What kind of ritual?"
Pellar: "Cleansing. The land... tainted. Crops wither, cows birth stillborn calves. Must appease the spirits."
Witcher: "Appeasing spirits usually means trouble. What’s causing it?"
Pellar: "Curse. Old. Buried bones, bones that shouldn’t be disturbed. Folk did. Now the spirits lash out."
Witcher: "And you want me to keep the angry spirits off your back while you fix it."
Pellar: "Aye. It’s... dangerous. Spirits drawn to blood, to fear. You’ll be... distraction. Keep them at bay while I work."
Witcher: "Dangerous for you, you mean. You plan on paying for this danger?"
Pellar: "Forty crowns now. Forty more if we see dawn. Agreed?"
Witcher: "Eighty total, huh? Fine. I’ll guard your bones, Pellar. When do we start?"
Pellar: "Midnight. When the veil is thinnest. Meet by the old willow. And... bring your silver."
Witcher: "Always do."
